R^ftlGTEDFOREWORDby the Secretary of State for Education and science and the Secretary of State for WalesEducation in the last decade has undergone great changes.The pace and depth of these changes are remarkable.   Twelve years ago, the labour government issued its first circular on comprehensivereorganisation, an objective which is largely but not yetwholly achieved, and which the Government is determined tocomplete.   Already in three quarters of our schools, the selective system is now a thing of the past.The content, as well as the structure, of education has changed.   There has been a wide range of new demands onthe curriculum, the introduction of new methods of teaching, and the gradual acceptance of a new examination,the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE).   These changehave brought with them a good deal of controversy;controversy over What has been achieved, over standards,and over the aims education ought to have.The period of change coincided with a rapid expansion ofthe number of children in the schools, and of the numberof young people in higher and further education.    this in turn created a demand for many more teachers.    Notsurprisingly, the turnover of teachers and the proportionof teachers with only a year or so of teaching experiencehave been very high. These factors - the speed of change, high turnover, inexperienced teachers trying to cope with new demands and new methods - have putconsiderable strain on the schools.    There are some areasof weakness in education and some unmet needs.    This papersets out proposals for dealing with themNone of this should mask the remarkable work being
iit-w i iiiC i EDundertaken in many of our schools.    It is the vigour,imagination and talent of the teachers in them thatimpress the visitor:    schools that open their facilities and their resources for learning to the entire local community;    schools that emphasise creativity in design,in making things as well as learning things;    schoolsthat tackle with sustained enthusiasm the problems ofchildren from other cultures or speaking other languagesand make a microcosm of a happy and co-operative world.We hope, therefore, that those who read this Green paper and note its recommendations will do so against this background of much that is exciting and even outstanding.So far as possible the Green Paper focuses on the educatinormally provided for children during their years of compulsory attendance at school.   References are made tosome areas of special need, but it does not deal witheducation in special schools, or with further education;and there is only brief reference to nursery education.These important subjects are being dealt with in otherways.The proposals may be built upon, altered in the course 1discussion, or superseded by developments that will emerge. There can never be final answers nor an end to debate. But there are times for self-examination folioby the setting down of new objectives and new ways of reaching those objectives. We believe we have now reacsuch a time, and this Green Paper is a response to it.
RESTRICTEDBACKGROUNDIntroduction1.1.     In his speech at Ruskin College, Oxford on 18 october the Prime Minister called for a public debate on education.The debate was not to be confined to those professionally-concerned with education, but was to give full opportunityfor employers and trades unions, and parents, as well asteachers and administrators, to make their views known.1.2.     The speech was made against a background of stronglycritical comment in the Press and elsewhere on education and educational standards.    Children&apos;s standards of performance in their school work were said to have declined.The curriculum, it was argued, paid too little attentionto the basic skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic,and was overleaded with fringe subjects.    Teachers lackedadequate professional skills, and did not know how todiscipline children or to instil in them concern for hardwork or good manners.    Underlying all this was the feeling that the educational system was out of touch with thefundamental need for Britain to survive economically in a highly competitive world.1.3.      Some of these criticisms are fair.    There is a widegap between the world of education and the world of work.Boys and girls are not sufficiently aware of the importanceof industry to our society, and they are not taught muchabout it.    In some schools, the curriculum has beenoverloaded, so that the basic skills of literacy andnumeracy, the building blocks of education, have beenRESTRICTED3.
neglected.    A small minority of schools has simply failedto provide an adequate education by modern standards.More frequently, schools have been over-ambitious,introducing modern languages without sufficient staff tomeet the needs of a much wider range of pupils, orembarking on new methods of teaching mathematics without making sure the teachers understood what they were teaching,or whether it was appropriate to the pupils&apos; capacitiesor the needs of their future employers.1.4   Other criticisms are misplaced.    It is simply untruethat there has been a general decline in educationalstandards.   Critics who argue on these lines often makefalse   comparisons, for instance with some non-existenteducational Golden Age, or matching today&apos;s school leaversagainst those of a generation ago   without allowing forthe fact that a far larger proportion of boys and girlsnow stay on into the sixth form.   Recent studies haveshown clearly that today&apos;s schoolchildren read better thanthose of thirty years ago.    Far more children, over a wider range of ability, study a modern language or science thandid a generation ago.   Many more take, and pass, publicexaminations.   Many more go on to full time higher education-1.5   The picture then, is far from clear.   Much has been achieved:    but there is legitimate ground for criticism and concern.    Education, like any other public service,is answerable to the society which it serves andwhich pays for it, so these criticisms must be given afair hearing.    In response to the Prime Minister&apos;sinitiative the Ministers concerned held a series of meeting3with national organisations representing a wide range of people having a special interest in education.    these meetings set the scene for a series of regional conferencesheld in the opening months of this year with invitationsissued to local authorities in each region, to teachers,
RESTRICTEDemployers, trades unions, the churches, parents and students.    In this setting many valuable ideas were put forward, both at the conferences themselves andin written documents.    The conferences were followed bya further round of meetings with those consulted theprevious autumn.    This combination.of meetings and conferences- in many ways a unique form of consultation for this country -identified a substantial measure of agreement on what needed to be done to improve our schools.1.6.    The discussions at the regional conferences were concentrated upon four main topics: the curriculum;the assessment of standards; the education and training of teachers; school and working life.   At the conference inVales a fifth topic was added - the place of the welsh language in schools in Wales.    This paper follows asimilar pattern but the analysis has to be seen againstthe wider background of recent history and social change,responsibilities, resources, and aims.Recent History1.7.    In retrospect 1977 may be seen as a turning pointin education.    The school population is now at its peak;it will decline for a decade at least (Figure 1).    there organisation of the secondary schools in England andWales to eliminate selection is largely accomplished.These two facts mark the end of a period in which there organisation of the school system and the demands of growing pupil numbers have overshadowed all educationaldebate and educational planning.1.8.    Secondary education for all was introduced in 1,94-5.Since then the school leaving age has been raised twice,in 1947 and 1973.    Opportunities to move on to further and higher education have greatly increased: theproportion of young people benefiting from post-schooleducation has more than doubled since 1960.    The developmentRESTRICTED
of the General Certificate of Education (GCE) and subsequentlyof the Certificate of Secondary Education (CSE) have provided a flexible system of examinations which four-fifths of allpupils now attempt.   The growth of the relevant age group,the increase in the proportion of those starting schoolbefore five and of those remaining at school after 16,have together led to an increase in the maintained school population of over 80% since 19^5.1.9   Large-scale expenditure would have been needed merely to match this increase in the number of pupils and toprovide schools in new housing areas.    But many otheradvances have taken place:    old secondary schools havebeen rebuilt, the remaining all-age schools have beeneliminated, and the quality of new school buildingsgreatly improved.   Class sizes have been reduced;(Table     ) the minimum teacher-training course hasbeen lengthened from two to three years and, with minorexceptions, professional training is now required forgraduates entering the teaching profession; recruitment to the profession, already fully qualified, will soonbecome all-graduate.Social change1.10   The past twenty years in education have been years of quantitative change - the explosion of numbers at every stage.    But education has also had to adapt to sweepingsocial changes as well.    Britain has ceased to be thecentre of an Empire, and has become instead a medium-sized4--i Ofl-^European power, albeit one with wide international connecwand responsibilities.    The country&apos;s economic well-beingdepends on its own efforts, and its standard of living is directly related to its ability to sell goods and services overseas.    At home, our society has changed substantially5because of the large scale movement of people withinBritainfor instance to New Towns and expanded towns; and also of
RESTRICTEDpeople into Britain, many from the new Commonwealth.    Ours isnow a multiracial and multicultural country, and one in whichtraditional social patterns are &quot;breaking down.    One centralexample of this is the disappearance of the old stereotypesof the sexes, based on a traditional division of labourbetween men and women.   Most girls now expect to have gobsas well as to bring up a family.1.11   Our educational system is adapting to these changes.The primary schools have adopted methods and approaches tolearning which reflect better understanding of children&apos;sgrowth and development.   Extra help has been given to children whose mother tongue is not English, or who have tomake the bewildering   transition from a developing ruralsociety to a sophisticated industrial one.    The comprehensiveschool reflects the need to educate our people for a differentsort of society, in which the talents and abilities of our people in all spheres need to be developed and respected;the education appropriate to our Imperial past cannot meetthe requirements of modern Britain.1.12   The curriculum of the schools must also reflect theneeds of this new Britain.    There is more emphasis on science and on modern languages.    Distinctions between what boys study and what girls study are disappearing, and in many schools bothare now educated for shared domestic responsibilities, includingthe responsibilities of future parenthood.    The comprehensivesecondary schools have responded imaginatively to the challengeof dealing with a whole new spectrum of pupils - and teachers.Only a minority of schools however convey adequately to theirpupils the fact that ours is an industrial society;    that wedepend upon industry to create the wealth without which oursocial services, our education and arts cannot flourish;    andthat industry offers scope for the imagination and even theidealism of young people.    Nor are our young people sufficientlyaware of the international interdependence of modern countries.Many of oizr most pressing problems can only be solved7.RttfJHICTED
llhSIftiGVEOinternationally, for instance environmental pollution;    soour children need to be educated in international understand:^as well.1.13   Both the primary and the secondary comprehensive schoolsseek to offer equal educational opportunities to all children.What they make of these opportunities depends upon theirmotivation, their willingness to work and the interest takenin than by their parents and families.   For some children,however, equality of opportunity is not enough.    These arethe children whose attitudes and performance are burdenedby adversity - physical or mental handicap, squalid housing?severe poverty, language difficulty, broken homes, inadequateor even uncaring parents.    Many of them suffer from a combination of such factors, adding up to a major handicapfor a particular child.   The Government believes indiscriminating in favour of children who are underprivilegedfor whatever reason.    It is right to direct extra resources to areas in which disadvantage is concentrated, for example the recently announced policy for the inner cities.    It isimportant too, to attract and keep good teachers in the schools in stress areas, and that is why the Governmentattaches great importance to training teachers familiar with the social problems many children face.Responsibilities within the Education system.14-   Educational policy in England and Wales evolves froma partnership between the Education Departments,the local education authorities and the teachers, and responsibility for education is shared between them:i)   The school:    the governors,     in conjunction withthe head teacher and his staff, are responsiblefor what goes on in the individual school. the framework is set by the lea, which appoints allthe governors in county schools, and a proportionRESTRICTED8.
SiiiiCTEDof those in voluntary schools.    In practice, muchof the day to day running of the school is devolvedupon the head teacher, in consultation with his staff.The crucial relationship in all learning is that between the individual pupil and his or her teacher.ii)   The lea:    each local education authority is responsiblefor providing education within its area, and mustby law appoint an education committee.    The authority&apos;financial resources are     mainly     provided from rates and from Rate Support Grant which is paid as a block in respect of all services.   education is by far the largest and most expensive service.iii)   The national level:    the Secretaries of State areresponsible in law for the promotion of theeducation of the people of   England and Wales.    they need to know what is being done by the local educationauthorities and, through them, what is happening inthe schools.    They must draw attention to nationalneeds if they believe the education system is not adequately meeting them.1.15   Parents are involved at each level of the system.    Themost frequent and direct kind of contact between the parentand the education system will be with the teacher, be itclass teacher or head teacher.    If the parents&apos; problemcannot be resolved at local level by teachers or governors,the way is open for an approach to the local educationauthority and its officers, and, if need be, directly to&quot;the Secretaries of State.    Until recently manyParents    played only a minor part in the education system.The Government is of the view   that parents should be givenmuch more information about the schools, and should be consultedmore widely.     With this in mind, a committee of inquiry under Mr Thomas Taylor was set up in January 1975 &quot;to review the arrangements for theManagement and government of maintained primary and secondary
RESTRICTEDschools in England and Wales, including the composition and functions of bodies of managers and governors, and theirrelationships with local education authorities, with headteachers and staffs of schools, with parents of pupils andwith the local community at large; and to make recommendation5It has just completed its work, and a report is to be publish^later this year.Resources1.16.    In looking at the prospects for education we must avoid two dangers.    One is to ignore the need for, andthe consequences of, economic restraint.    The other is toassume that the difficulties associated with restraintmake any improvement impossible.   Although some improvementscall for additional resources, others, including many ofthose proposed in this paper, do not.    The extent to which increased resources for education will be available inthe future depends largely on the success of the IndustrialStrategy.    It is vital to Britain&apos;s economic recovery andstandard of living that the performance of manufacturing industry is improved and that the whole range of government policies, including education, contributes as much aspossible to increasing industrial performance and therebythe national wealth.1.17.    In order to control a disturbing high rate of inflation^1and to ensure adequate resources for regenerating industry^the Government&apos;s two top priorities, economic restrainthas been necessary.    It has been reflected most sharply i11the reduction in public expenditure since 1975-    Education1in company with other programmes such as housing and roadshas had to take its share of these cuts amounting in theperiod 1975 to 1977 to  150 million (2.4%),    These cuts have undoubtedly delayed some badly needed school buildingsRESTRICTED10.
&quot;RICTEDand other capital developments.    They have also imposedsevere constraints on the maintenance and upkeep of buildings, on the provision of school equipment and materials, on the numbers of non-teaching staff, and on other long-desired educational developments: the achievement of further reductions in class size has hadto be postponed.   But these reductions must be restricted
tiLoIuiCILDJudged against the major expansion in expenditure on education that took place in the period 1965 to 1975*an increase of 60% in real terms:    and against the substantial fall in pupil numbers which is now occurring.Public expenditure for 1977/78 has now been settled:the figures for future years remain provisional butby the end of the decade it should be possible to resumea modest rate of growth in public expenditure,1.18  Everything that is said in the subsequent sectionsof this paper must be seen against the background of theresources available.   Each local education authority and each school has to assess its own capacity, in terms of qualified teachers, educational equipment, and accommodatioDto achieve its objectives.   Resource constraints were not always taken into account during the period of rapid development in the curriculum and in teaching methodsthat occurred in the last decade;    they must be borne in mind in any proposals for the future.The aims of the schools1.19   Schools must have aims against which to judge the effectiveness of their work and hence the kinds of improvements that they may need to make from time to time*The majority of people would probably agree with thefollowing attempt to set out these aims, though theymight differ in the emphasis to be placed on one orthe other :i.     to help children develop lively, enquiringminds;    giving them the ability to question and to argue rationally, and to applythemselves to tasks;RES&quot;. GTED12.

Some aims vary in importancRESTRICTEDl7;
RESTRfCTEat different periods of a pupil&apos;s education; others areconstant throughout.   All of them apply to boys and togirls.    Equal opportunity does not necessarily meanidentical classroom provision for boys and girls but itis essential that, in translating their aims into day-to-day practice, schools should not by their assumptions,decisions, or choice of teaching materials, limit the educational opportunities offered to girls.
CURRICULUMprimary schools2.1     Primary schools have been transformed in recent years by two things:   a much wider curriculum than used to be consideredsufficient for elementary education, and the rapid growth of theso-called &apos;child-centred&apos; approach.   The primary curriculum hasoeen enriched by a feeling for colour, design and music, and by^e intorduction of simple scientific ideas.   Children engage indesigned to increase their control over themselves bothPhysically and mentally, to capture their imagination and to widentheir knowledge and understanding of the world about them.   the child-centred approach takes advantage of the child&apos;s individualstage of development and of his or her interests:   it complementsthe wider curriculum by harnessing the natural enthusiasm of young children for learning things by their own efforts instead of merelybeing fed with information.    In the right hands, this approachhas produced confident, happy and relaxed children, without anysacrifice of the 3 Rs or other accomplishments - indeed, withsteady improvement in standards.   Visitors have come from all overthe world to see, and to admire,the English and Welsh &quot;primaryschool revolution&apos;.2*2    Unfortunately, however, the work has notal*ays been in the hands of experienced and able teachers.   While^7 a tiny minority of schools adopted the child-centred approach to the exclusion of other teaching methods, its influence has beenbespread. Jt Proved a trap for some less able or lesse*ineperienced teachers who applied the     freer methods uncritically orfailed to recognise that they require careful planning of the0Pportunities offered to children and systematic monitoring of theEgress of individuals.   While the majority of primary teachers,wb&amp;tever approach they use, recognise the importance of performance1x1 basic skills such as reading, spelling and arithmetic, someWe failed to achieve satisfactory results in them.   In someMasses, or even some schools, the use of the child-centred approachW deteriorated into lack of order and application.RESTRICTED
2.3     The challenge now is to restore the rigour withoutdamaging the real benefits of the child-centreddevelopments.   This does not imply any great change inthe range of what is taught, but the following features,already characteristic of the most effective schools,should be adopted more widely:i.     in all schools teachers need to be quite clearabout the ways in which children make and showprogress in the various aspects of their learning&apos;They can then more easily choose the bestapproach for their pupils.ii.     Teachers should be able to identify with someprecision the levels of achievement represented by a pupil1s work.    In parts of the curriculumsuch as arithmetic, it is comparatively easy toorganise a series of targets for the pupilsaccording to a logical sequence of difficulty.In other parts of the curriculum where teachersare planning to develop their pupils&apos; imaginationand social awareness, it may not be possible tobe so precise.   Teachers can nonetheless plan aprogression in these parts of the curriculum andso ensure that they make their proper   contributi011to the child&apos;s education.111,Teachers in successive classes of schools need to agree about what is to be learned.   They should as a matter of professional habit pass on clearinformation about work done and levels of achievement.iv.     Even allowing for local and individual needs,children throughout England and Wales have manyeducational requirements in common.   It istherefore reasonable to expect that childrenmoving from a primary school in one part of thecountry to another elsewhere will find much thatis familiar in kind if not in detail.
There are some skills for which the primary-schools have a central, and indeed over-riding,responsibility.   Literacy and numeracy are themost important of these:    no other curricularaims should deflect teachers from them.   Theyshould be defined as part of the core of learning,the protected area of the curriculum.Middle schools2.4.   For the most part middle schools do not present uniquecurricular issues, though their size and organisation high-light certain problems and particularly those connected withcontinuity.    Furthermore, resources, and especially teacherswith particular training or expertise,are often, rightly,deployed rather differently in areas with middle schools ascompared with others where pupils transfer at 11 years of age.A middle-school system with careful co-ordination   between thephases of schooling can work well, with some aspects of schoolwork being started earlier and others later.    It can, however,cause some difficulty for pupils who transfer into or out of thearea.   Since middle schools are in a minority, transition isa matter to which the local education authorities and teachers in such areas need to give special consideration.2.5.   The resources available in a school, and particularly the training and expertise of the staff, have directconsequences for the range and depth of work that can be offered.   The small sizes of middle school staffs as comparedwith those of traditional comprehensive schools have aparticular effect, for example, on science, modern languagesand handicrafts; many middle schools, including the smaller9-13 schools, are unable to allocate more than one post to each of these specialisms, and some none.Secondary schools2.6.   Four fifths of our boys and girls now attend comprehensiveschools.   The comprehensive school is at the centre of theGovernments policy on secondary education.   The objective ofthe comprehensive system is to offer to every boy or girleducational opportunities appropriate to his or her ability, appitudtRFSTIjijjJTED
RtSUlOTED?aand personal motivation.    It recognises the importance ofeducating together hoys and girls from different backgroundsas an essential preparation for a more united and understand!^society.2.6a     The rapid development of comprehensive schools hasrequired great efforts by teachers, local education authori^-1-and the churches, and could not have been achieved without their co-operation.    Ideas about the reorganisation of schools naturally continue to evolve.    The end of selection ^0secondary education, to which the Government remain whollycommitted, is in sight.    With the benefit now of substantialexperience, the time is ripe for a conference the Secretary 0State for Education and Science will organise later this year&apos;This conference will provi.de an opportunity for sharingexperience of successful practice in comprehensive schools-i isi^2.7.      The curriculum is not the school&apos;s sole means of real-the purposes of comprehensive education.    The creation of alively and caring community, where the pupils have opportumto exercise initiative and responsibility; the sensitiveorganisation of groups for learning and other activities;the establishment of an unobtrusive system of effective guia&apos;and support for the adolescent are crucial to success.    Bu&quot;Cthese serve the cause of the pupils&apos; learning, which is theschool&apos;s main business and which is embodied in the curncUThe comprehensive school&apos;s curriculum must reflect the dive-1-of its pupils&apos; individual needs.    In educational terms, the comprehensive school aspires to educate all our children totbethe highest standards of which they are capable.    Whateverdifficulties and problems on the way, and this paper doesseek to minimise them, that remains the Government&apos;s goal-2.8.      Secondary schools, like primary schools, have beentransformed.    The curriculum now generally offers a greate&quot;RESTRICTED*   18.
spectrum of learning and a broader range of choices thandid the traditional selective system.   A much higher proportionof pupils now take public examinations, the Certificate of secondary Education, or the GCE Ordinary or Advanced levels.New content and new styles of learning in the sciences andmathematics have helped to make these subjects more interestingand more accessible to many pupils.    The opportunity to learna modern language has been given to a much wider range of pupils of different abilities than in the past.    There has,in general, been a good deal of curriculum experiment anddiversification and the early years of CSE stimulatedfundamental and valuable study of the needs of those leavingschool - and often formal education - at 16.2.9.     These advances have not been without attendant weaknessesFurther progress must build on the achievements of recentyears and take account of current criticism.    It is not surprising that achieving the intentions of the educationalreformers has proved slower and more difficult than was envisaged.    Comprehensive reorganisation has itself made considerable demands on the time and energy of teachers,especially those in senior positions.2.10.    The pace of change has outstripped the supply ofappropriately qualified and experienced teachers.    Some didnot understand sufficiently clearly the nature of the changeson which they were embarking, nor did they all benefit fromadequate support from in-service courses.    This is particularlytrue of teachers changing from a grammar or secondary modernRESTRICTED
Ri-STRWTEDschool to a comprehensive one, normally faced with teachingpupils of a wider or different range of ability.2.11.   The secondary curriculum has been under great pressure from the constantly growing demands upon it.   These reflect the complexities of adult life which await the pupils whenthey leave school.    But there has been considerable criticism on the grounds that the curriculum has become over-loadedand that essential educational objectives may have been put at risk.2.12.   The balance and breadth of each child&apos;s course is cruciat all school levels, and this is especially the case duringthe later years of compulsory education.    In most secondary schools the curriculum of the main school course is broadlytotraditional for the first two or three years.   Options beginshape-the curriculum significantly in the fourth and fifth 7eEnglish and religious education are in most schools a standardpart of the curriculum for all pupils up to the age of 16,and&apos;it is not true that many pupils drop mathematicsat an early stage.   But the offer of options and the freedom to choose do lead some boys and girls to abandon certain area5of study at an early age.   This is questionable in a societylike ours where the rapidity of change puts a premium on the sound acquisition of certain basic skills developed in up-t0&apos;jdate terms to the limit of the pupil&apos;s ability and understand1^Few, inside or outside the schools, would contest that alongEnglish and mathematics, science should find a secure place for all pupils at least to the age of 16, and that a modernlanguage should do so for as high a proportion as practicable2.1.3.   These thoughts were reflected in much of the discussi00on the curriculum at the regional conferences.   Unease - at)0the curriculum is expressed in many forms   but the principalpoints of concern appear to be:i.     the curriculum has become overcrowded;The timetable is overloaded and the essentials are at risk.ii.     variations in the approach to the curriculumin different schools can penalise a child
in.IV.simply because be has moved from one area toanother.even if the child does not move, variations fromschool to school may give rise to inequality of opportunities.the curriculum in many schools is not sufficientlymatched to life in a modern industrial society.2.14.     Not all these comments may be equally valid but it isclear that the time has come to try to establish generally accepted principles for the composition of the secondarycurriculum for all pupils.   This does not presuppose uniformanswers: schools, pupils, and their teachers are different, andthe curriculum should be flexible enough to reflect these differences.   But there is a need to investigate the part whichmight be played by a &quot;protected&quot; or &quot;core&quot; element of the curriculumcommon to all schools.   There are various ways this may be defined.Properly worked out, it can offer reassurance to employers, parentsand the teachers themselves, as well as a very real equality of opportunity for pupils.2.15.     The creation of a suitable core curriculum will not be easy.   Pupils in their later years of secondary schooling have a wide range of interests and expectations.   Many of them will needhelp to see the relevance of what school offers and to understandbow their skills can be used for their adult and working life.This can contribute to overcoming the lack of motivation anduncooperative attitudes displayed by some pupils.   It is not thetask of schools to prepare pupils for specific jobs but experience has long shown that studies and activities that are practical andobviously relevant to working life can be valuable as a means oflearning, including the learning of basic skills.2.16. Apart from the central question of curriculum planning upto the age of 16 there are other aspects of the problem that need more study.RESTRICTED
HLw i Hi GT EDSome narrowing of the range of subjects studiedafter 16 is legitimate and perhaps inevitable,but traditional practice in England and Walesmay have gone too far in this direction.   Someof those who follow academic sixth form coursesdevote almost all their time to only two or three cj-related subjects, without even the substantialbroadening element of general studies provided inmany schools.   There has however been much discussi011elsewhere of this feature of secondary education,and it will come under scrutiny again in relationto possible changes in the examination system.Both before and after 16, care must be taken tosee that girls do not by their choices limit the range of educational and career opportunitiesopen to them.   Positive steps may be necessary toencourage girls to broaden and modernise theiraspirations and to feel confident of success inunfamiliar fields of science and technology.This is particularly important now that there are many fewer places available in colleges of educati011to which a large number of girls have traditionallygone for their higher education.The curriculum for the less academic sixth formeris not well defined.   The same general principlesaPPly as at earlier stages in the secondary schoolbut particular care has to be taken to ensure thatthe education given to this very wide range of pupils furthers their career prospects aswell as their personal development.    It is importa71^that they understand the range of opportunities opel1to them and what they stand to gain or lose byfollowing one or other course.RLSiaiGTED
Action on the curriculum2.17Action to improve the planning and developmentof the curriculum will be successful only if it takes intoaccount fully the division of responsibilities for education in schools.   The control of secular instruction in maintainedschools - aided secondary schools apart - rests with thelocal education authority, subject to the provisions of each schoolrules of management or articles of government.    In practice,much of the responsibility for deciding the curriculum ofeach school is devolved by the local education authoritiesand the governors or managers upon the teachers or headteachers in the schools.2.18 It would not be compatible with the duty of the secretaries of State to &quot;promote the education of thepeople of England and Wales&quot; or with their accountabilityto Parliament, to abdicate from leadership on educationalissues which have become a matter of lively public concern.The Secretaries of State will therefore seek to establish a broad agreement with their partners in the education service on a framework for the curriculum, and, particularly,on whether, because there are aims common to all schools and to all pupils at certain stages, there should be a&quot;core&quot; or &quot;protected part&quot;.2.19  In their turn, the local education authorities mustco-ordinate the curriculum and its development in theirown areas, taking account of local circumstances, consultinglocal interests and drawing on the work of the SchoolsCouncil and other curricular research and developmentagencies.    In this way the proper professional freedom of individual schools and their teachers can be exercised tothe best advantage.il jIliiCTED
2.20   As the next step the Secretaries of State propose to invite the local authority and teacher associations to take part in early consultations about the conduct of a reviewof curricular arrangements in each local authority area.The Schools Council will be invited to play a part inthese consultations.   Appropriate provision will also bemade for other interested organisations to express theirviews.2.21   The intention of the Secretaries of State is that,following these consultations, they should issue a circularasking all local education authorities to carry out the review in their own areas in consultation with theirteachers and to report the results within about twelvemonths.   The Departments would then analyse the replies asa preliminary to consultations on the outcome of the review and on the nature of any advice which the secretaries of State might then issue on curricularmatters.2.2 2   The circular initiating the review would call forinformation about the existing practice of local educationauthorities and schools in their area, and any plansalready in hand for developing it.   The following broadheadings indicate the ground that the review is intendedto cover :-Local arrangements for the co-ordination of thecurriculum and any plans for its development.The transition of pupils between schools.The keeping of school records of pupils&apos; progress.Balance and breadth in the curriculum.-&apos;.n
RES I MOVEDPreparation for working life, including all aspects of schools/industry understanding andliaison and careers education.The study of selected subject areas (eg English,Mathematics, Modern Languages, Science).Welsh in the Curriculum of the Schools of wales.23   English is the language of the majority of the peopleof Wales and the need for competence in English referred toearlier applies equally to schools in Wales.    But Welsh isthe first language of a significant proportion of thepopulation and is a national language in Wales.   It has played an important part in shaping contemporary Welshsociety;   and it is the focal point of a heritage ofwhich children in Wales need to become aware if they areto understand their identity and their place within theUnited Kingdom.   It is for these reasons that children in Wales should be given the opportunity to have Welshin their curriculum in accordance with parental wishes and where practical considerations allow.   The evidence doesnot suggest that either the inclusion of Welsh in thecurriculum or its use as a medium of teaching has harmfuleffects on general educational progress.2. 24 In areas where Welsh is used extensively it is a proper objective of the curricula of the schools to enablepupils to develop a command of the language which will allow them to enter fully into the life of their community.Where Welsh is spoken only by small minorities the objectivesare necessarily different.   Some children whose homelanguage is not Welsh may aspire to fluency.   Others mayreach worthwhile levels of attainment in comprehensionand appreciation of the history and society of Wales.n
RESTRICTED2.25     There is a widespread and justifiable feeling thatlevels of attainment in many schools are low.   A number of reasons account for this.    In some areas the pedagogical tas*is made difficult by the varied language backgrounds of pupil-within the same class and by social mobility.    But there isalso evidence that the expectations of many teaches are undulylow.    This is reflected in the meagre time allocations oftengiven.    Welsh tends to be taught in isolation from otherlearning experiences.    And there are widespread weaknesses U1teaching techniques.    The schools which stand out assuccessful in the teaching of Welsh as a second languageare the designated bilingual schools and those otherschools which concentrate on promoting communicationskills in the second language.2.26     Both formal research and more general observationsupport the view that children learn a second language more effectively to the extent that native language learningconditions are simulated which allow the learner to use the language he is learning.   Progression and continuity withi11schools and between stages are also basic to success inthe learning of Welsh.    These considerations point to theneed for both clearer policies to ensure continuity of teaching and a growth of in-service training.2.27     The proportion of teachers needing to be trained toteach Welsh or to teach through the medium of Welsh couldbe planned more adequately if authorities were to examinetheir needs in relation to the present shortcomings inprovision.    Clear language policies formulated byauthorities in consultation with parents and teachers soas to reflect in a purposeful way the linguistic characterof their areas would provide an element of motivation andwould enable individual schools in turn to formulatepositive policies within the framework provided.   AuthoriRESTRICTED
RESTRICTEDin Wales are therefore invited to include such policies in the report on curricular plans for their areas whichhave been called for in this paper.2.28 The Secretary of State for Wales is consideringrequests from several bodies for specific grants to bemade towards the cost of bilingual education. In thisconnection the Government have indicated in their green paper on local government finance (Cmnd 6813) that they wish to discuss any proposals involving a wider use of specific grants with local authority associations.RESTRICTED27
JNursery education2.29  Entry to nursery or primary school is an importantevent.   For many children it may be their first bigexperience of life away from the family.   More than half our children now start their schooling before they arefive in nursery schools and classes   or in the receptionclasses of primary schools.   In the last few years therehas been a big expansion of nursery education, mainly ona part-time basis;   and as the age groups decline, theproportion of under-fives who are in school will risesteadily, even though limitations on resources willconfine further expansion of provision in the immediatefuture to the areas of greatest social deprivation.2.30  Nursery education is valuable for almost all children&apos;But it should supplement, not replace, what a child learnsat home.   The experience of the playgroup movement hasshown that parents often wish to be closely involved inthe education and development of other young children aswell as their own;    and with professional guidance parentscan play a valuable part in nursery schools and playgroupsand by so doing can better fulfil their own role as parents&apos;The Government has in recent years encouraged localauthorities to improve the co-ordination of all availableservices for under-fives so as to make the maximum use ofexisting resources in the education, social services and health fields, as well as those which the community can provide through volunteers and voluntary bodies.   This isan area of provision in which there is a growing interest 1especially in relation to the needs of children withbackgrounds of disadvantage of various kinds, and in whicka number of new ideas involving the development of links between the education service and day nurseries, childminders and playgroups are being tried and tested.   TheDepartment of Education and Science and the Department ofHealth and Social Security hope shortly to issue a furtherjoint circular to local authorities on this matter.
RESTRICTEDSTANDARDS AND ASSESSMENTStandards3.1   At the regional conferences there was no widespread viewthat there had been a serious decline in educational standards.But elsewhere the conviction has been expressed thatdeterioration has occurred.   Undoubtedly higher standards havebeen more difficult to achieve in recent years because of thehigh rates of wastage and turnover among teachers in primary and secondary schools, especially in some deprived urban areas.In 1962, the proportion of teachers who left the profession - the wastage rate - was 8.4%;    by 1972, it had risen to 9.5% and inaddition a further 11% changed schools.    In some urban areas thepercentages were much higher:    as many as one in four of allteachers in some local education authority areas left theirschools during 1973.    Pupils in some of the older city schoolsoften suffered from frequent changes of teaching staff.   Addedto this were the demands of change itself on teachers1 time,skills and energy:    for example the raising of the school leaving age, reorganisation of secondary education and newapproaches to the syllabus, such as modern mathematics orNuffield science.    One important reason for expecting educationalstandards now to improve is the marked decline in wastage amongteachers in the last two years.    It is estimated that in 1976wastage was between 6A% and 7?% and in many urban authoritiesturnover was less than half the 1974 figure.   A period of stability would do a great deal of good for our schools.3.2   Within the general broadening of the curriculum there hasbeen an extension of the range of skills and ideas that havebeen looked for in children.    This may cut both ways.    It has beenalleged that, in primary schools, improved fluency in writing hasbeen achieved at the expense of accuracy in spelling andpunctuation;    and that efforts to introduce modern aspects ofmathematics and to reduce apprehension in pupils have been accompanied by diminished accuracy in traditional arithmetic.    Inaddition some teachers in primary and secondary schools have found themselves teaching beyond the limit of their previous experience and professional competence; this is animportant cause for concern, for example, in relation to standardsRiCTED
HL8T RIOTEDof achievement in mathematics at the primary school orFrench at the secondary school.   Some of these problems are essentially transitional;   they will disappear as teachersgain more experience in their new schools and with the new methods.   Others can be overcome by preparation, in-service training and so on.   But what must be recognised is that it isnot sufficient just to maintain present standards;    like thenation as a whole the schools have to meet the growing andchanging demands of the future.Assessment3-3     Growing recognition of the need for schools to demonstrate their accountability to the society which theyserve requires a coherent and soundly based means of assessmentfor the educational system as a whole, for schools, and for individual pupils.(i) The national level3.4     The traditional and long established means for assessing the performance of the educational system as a whole rest witnHM Inspectorate and, more recently, with local educationauthority advisory services.   They provide well-developed metn0of describing and assessing the system and the institutionswithin it;   the evidence they gather contributes to the supPor*and development of schools and teachers, and points to anyremedial action if a school is consistently less thansatisfactory.   Both, in different ways, are accountable and neeto understand how their similar but complementary responsiblefit together in the interest of the system;   both need to bestaffed to meet the demands made upon them.3.5     Inspection seeks in the first place to answer thequestion:    is the work upon which the pupils are engagedsuited to the circumstances in which they are growing up,and is it pitched at a level and conducted in a way thatwill enable them to make the progress they should?   It then      ^seeks to analyse and interpret the findings of the inspection ^Districted30.
in order to arrive at wider educational conclusions.   It isfor local education authorities to decide how to apply theresults of inspections by local inspectors.   In contrast,the conclusions reached by HM Inspectorate must be capableof being related nationally to the education system.3.6      On the whole, inspection tends to be a subjective andqualitative process, though HM Inspectorate is increasingly moving towards complementary quantitative analyses of which the currentsurveys of primary and secondary schools are a good example.Where a wholly quantitative assessment is desirable thisis best done on the basis of statistical sampling.   the assessment of Performance Unit (APU) of the Department ofEducation and Science, within its general terms of reference(Annex ),is concentrating at present on the development of tests suitable for national monitoring in English language,mathematics and science.   Their programme of nationalassessment will start in 1978:   the initial studies will bein the area of mathematics, probably with 11 and 15 year-olds,to be followed by a study of English language.(ii)     The schools3.7      Local education authorities need to be able to assess the relative performance of their schools to reach decisions about staffing, the allocation of resources, and other matters.In particular, it is an essential facet of their accountabilityfor educational standards that they must be able to identifyschools which consistently perform poorly, so that appropriateremedial action can be taken.   Such assessment will take account of examination and test results, but will also dependheavily on a detailed knowledge of the circumstances of the schools by the authorities&apos; officers, their inspectors and advisers, and such self assessment as may be undertaken bythe schools.     There is scope here for authorities to try and achieve a greater degree of uniformity on their approach to the assessment of schools.      &apos;League tables&apos;
of school performance based on examination or standardisedtest results in isolation can be seriously misleadingbecause they fail to take account of other important factorssuch as the wide differences between school catchmentareas.   This danger will be recognised by local educationauthorities which are operating assessment practices (of whatever type) yielding results for their schools individually&apos;Increasingly schools should assess their own performanceagainst their own objectives as well as external criteria.In so doing they may be expected to keep under review muchinformation useful to their governors, the local authority and HM Inspectorate.(iii)   The pupils as individuals3.8      The main purposes of the assessment of individualpupils are:i.   to provide teachers with information about theprogress and needs of pupils for whom they areresponsible, and to enable them to assess the effectiveness of their own planning and teaching&apos;ii.   to enable the pupils to know how they areprogressing and to provide incentives to betterperformance;iii.   to enable parents to be informed about their children&apos;s educational progress;iv.   to provide information about pupils at points 0the^transition with the education system and whenleave school to start work or to go on to further and higher education.3.9      Teachers adopt a variety of procedures for assessment&apos;alone and in combination. There is, for example, the minu*e&apos;to-minute questioning and scrutiny of children&apos;s work thatis an ordinary part of the school day.   There are the
setting of objective tests and of periodic internal schoolexaminations.    Teachers also need to pin-point individualweaknesses through diagnostic assessment, including testing.Here the professional competence and knowledge of the teacherare of prime importance.    The APTJ will produce some testssuitable for use by local education authorities and teachersfor this purpose.   The Education Departments will encourage thedevelopment of such tests and it is hoped that they will becomewidely used by schools and authorities; greater oonsistency of practice can only be beneficial.3.10   The Departments ai*e concerned with assessing individualpupils only as members of a representative sample, and this isthe major function of the APU.    A number of leas have already decided on or are considering monitoring the performance of pupils in their areas:    tests suitable for this purpose arelikely to come out of the work of the APTJ-.- The Departmentsprincipal concern is that there should be consistency withinLocal Education Authorities aad wherever possible betweenauthorities.3.11    It has been suggested that individual pupils should at certain ages take external &quot;tests of basic literacy andnumeracy&quot;, the implication being that those tests shouldbe of national character and universally applied.    the secretaries of State reject this view.    Because of the differing abilities and rates of development of children of school age, tests pitched at a single level could be irrelev^r.for some and beyond the reach of others.    Moreover the temptation for schools to coach for such tests would riskdistorting the curriculum and possibly       lowering ratherthan raising average standards.
RFSTWCTEDThe idea of a leaving certificate for all pupils3.12.      Traditionally, information about pupils on leavingschool for employment or further and higher education hasbeen conceived chiefly in terms of the results of publicexaminations taken at 16+ and 18+.    The Certificate of secondary Education was designed for pupils of averageability while the General Certificate of Education &apos;0&apos;&apos;A&apos;  levels are traditionally taken by the more able pupils. ^he*however, limitations on the usefulness of this information.Examination results do not offer a comprehensivepicture of the abilities of any individual school leaverand many pupils will continue to leave without achievinggraded examination results ; it is doubtful whether thepupils or the schools would be helped by further examinations*attainments, motivation and personal qualities not reflected in examination results will be of interest to employers andothers, and it may not always be possible to assess these si^P^by interview.    This raises the question of whether there shouldbe leaving certificates for all pupils.3.13.     But there are a number of practical difficulties.First, it is not clear how widely the value of suchcertificates would be recognised, even locally, unless it can be demonstrated that the standards portrayed by the teachers completing the certificates are consistent.    Second?there is the risk that the certificates might be more of adiscouragement to those whose certificates were unfavourable(as some must be if the system is to attain credibility) th^11a stimulus to the rest.    Third, the production of honest and frank reports on certain pupils could engender controversy between parents and teachers.    There are nevertheless a numb^of relevant local experiments which the Secretaries of state will watch with interest: they will also consider commissi0113-
fiEoi RIOTEDa national study into the possibilities for a leavingcertificate.Public examinations3.14   The Secretaries of State have commissioned studieson the Schools Council&apos;s proposals for the introduction of acommon system of examinations at 16+; these studies will involvea review of the present system of examining boards in Englandand Wales.   They should be completed early next year.   the secretaries of State are also considering the schools council&apos;srecommendations for a certificate of Extended Education (CEE)at the age of 17+.   The Schools Council is also actively pursuingthe possibility of changes to 18+ examinations.    This review is designed to meet the concern (noted in paragraph 2.16) thatexists about the present degree of specialisation in the sixthform curriculum.3.15  The Government accept the need to end uncertainty over thedevelopment of 16+ and 17+ examinations and the value of implementing desirable changes without delay.   But, equally,they are determined that any changes introduced shall stand the test of time and that the examinations of the future as of thepresent shall have national currency and acceptance.   decisions will therefore only be taken when this can be done with confidence,3.16   The present system of single subject GCE 0 level and CSEexaminations at 16+ is healthy in that it helps schools totailor the curriculum to fit the needs of individual pupilswho are taking external examinations, and it can benefit thoseunlikely to be successful across a wide area of the curriculum.It has, however, been suggested that a &quot;grouped&quot; certificateawarded to candidates who take at an appropriate level a numberof specified subjects including mathematics and English, andpossibly science and a modern language, might provide a usefulincentive to pupils to follow more balanced courses.
itcoi rUuiLO3.17.     Study of this possibility would not imply thatsingle-subject examining at 16+ should be abandoned.Those for whom it may be appropriate to take subjectsincluding none or some only of those specified could stilldo so and could receive notification of awards inessentially the present style.   Likewise, if issue of a&quot;grouped certificate&quot; was conditional on the achievement ofcertain grades in one or more of the specified subjects,lesser grades could still be recorded as they are now.3.18.     This outline description of the possibilities leavesa number of detailed points for further consideration.The uses to which such a grouped certificate might be put &quot;by employers or in further and higher education would need careful scrutiny.   When such issues have been studied, itwill be necessary to consult further on the issue ofprinciple, whether a &quot;grouped certificate&quot; on the bestbasis that can be devised should or should not be introduced the Government intend to take that decision in due course,but are under no illusion that the appropriate study canbe completed quickly or that it will not be controversial.At the same time the sooner it is started the better.The Government will be embarking on talks with the SchoolsCouncil and other bodies (including the Examination Boards)about the possibility of fitting the exploratory work intothe former&apos;s current programme.Record keeping3.19.     The need for keeping school records of the educati0development of individual children has long been recognise^&apos;It is more than ever true today, bearing in mind thegreater number of transfers between schools which now takeplace as a result of increased parental mobility, and the wider range of opportunities for further education and caxchoice, that clear and   reliable   records of progress are        ^cnecessary if individual help and counselling are to be PrThe keeping and transmission of records should be system a -t1and understandable; they should be subject to clearly aTit   9understood and agreed controls on what information is kepwhat is not; and on what is disseminated and to whoffl&apos;
and full regard must be paid to the rights of parents,as well as those of teachers and pupils, to know whatmaterial is included.3.20. The Secretaries of State therefore propose that, aspart of the review outlined in paragraphs 2.1.9-2.22, localeducation authorities should examine and report on theirexisting practices in relation to records of pupils&apos;progress.   The review would cover the records themselves,arrangements for parents to see records, and the currencythe records should have.   There is a need for high standards of professional accuracy in record-keeping and for areasonable consistency of practice between different areasof the country.my:;iVsOi&apos;ED37.
TRANSITION BETWEEN SCHOOLS4.1.       Substantial problems can occur at the point of transition between primary and secondary schools.    Lack ofcontinuity between successive stages, whatever the organisational pattern, can have especially severeconsequences in subjects like mathematics, science andmodern   languages, where progress depends heavily uponwhat has already been learned.    The difficulties can beaccentuated where pupils move from one part of the countryto another; even within a single local authority area,problems may arise from the differing approaches adoptedamong primary schools and the different standards of performance achieved.    Some local education authorities witha substantial responsibility towards families in the ArmedServices make special efforts, for example through the useof educational records, to reduce the difficulties which thechildren of such families encounter: there are lessons here for wider application.4.2.       Difficulties of transition within an area often arisebecause there is insufficient contact between the teachers of secondary school and those in their contributory primary or m1schools.   Where, as is often the case, children go from onelower school to a number of upper schools, or, as is almostalways the case, an upper school takes children from anumber of lower schools, close contacts between schools are needed both across tiers and within them.    Problems occurringwhen children move from area to area are less easily resolved-the general acceptance of the idea of a protected part of ^ecurriculum would contribute to minimising the difficulties-This whole problem needs the urgent attention of local educaauthorities, not least to ensure that parents whose jobs demaI1^mobility should not be deterred by fear of disruption in thei^children&apos;s schooling.i! &apos; U IRIOTED
RESTRICTEDSPECIAL NEEDS OF MINORITY GROUPSThe needs of ethnic minority children5.1     Some children belonging to ethnic minorities, bothrecent immigrants and the descendants of earlier immigrants,have special cultural and educational needs.    For some ofthem there are difficulties of adjustment       life in an alienlanguage and culture.    The educational needs of such childrenhave received much attention over the years from the teaching profession, from local education authorities and from theEducation Departments; this work has received useful impetusfrom reports of the House of Commons Select Committee onRace Relations, the latest of which has drawn particular attention to the needs of young West Indians.5.2     But the work has been hampered by inadequate knowledgeof the facts, since Governments have been reluctant to collect statistics concerning ethnic minorities, fearingthis might be regarded as divisive.    Tne Government,however, has concluded that statistical knowledge is essential for any effective policy of positive discrimination to helpmeet the special needs of ethnic minorities.    To thisend, the Secretary of State has now invited views from a wide range of bodies on the recommendations in the Select committee report, including those concerning the statistical monitoringof pupils, students and teachers.    The Government&apos;s wish is to alleviate inequalities of opportunity as fully as possilbe within the education system and to co-operate with otherdepartments in joint social policies.    As well as seeking toimprove the academic performance of some pupils of immigrantorigin, the education service will need to encourage moreyoung people from the ethnic minorities to enter teaching;special courses of preparation for teacher training may need to be arranged for mature students.    Such practical steps wouldbe in the context of existing policy.to I HiCfED
5-3   The Secretaries of State are also prepared to set up an inquiry to consider directions of future policy.    Theyare concerned that there should he a &quot;broad basis of agreement about the objectives of such a committee, and have invitedviews on whether it should be concerned for example withWest Indians only (as recommended by the Select Committee)or be extended to include the needs of other minority groups,alternatively such an inquiry might embrace the wider concepof the education of all children for life in a multi-racialsociety.5.4   It would be short-sighted to think of the establishment in this country of communities of overseas origin only interms of the problems they present.   We should welcome theenrichment of our culture which these communities can proviuif only we have the imagination to accept it.The needs of the handicapped and other disadvantaged5.5   A few children suffer from physical or mental handicapor mental disturbance so severe that dedicated and specia-efforts are needed to help them achieve the most modest(though nevertheless worthwhile) levels of educationalperformance and social adjustment.    Many others have less serious handicaps which call for special education - in tbetraditional sense of the term - either in special schoolsor increasingly in ordinary schools.    Apart from society&apos;3duty to enable every child to benefit to his limit from theeducation system it is important in the national interest that the full potential of the handicapped is discoveredand developed.    The integration of handicapped children i11ordinary schools, where this is in their interests and practicable, will be helped when Section 10 of the EducatioTlAct 1976 is brought into force, and will receive close attention in the report of the Warnock Committee, due tobe published next year.
The needs of travelling children5.6     Children of travelling parents, such as gypsies,present special problems to the education service.    Manyauthorities are to be commended on the particular measureswhich they have taken to help this section of the community,for example, the West Midlands Group Scheme for Gypsy Education,which makes use of mobile classrooms and operates acrossAuthority boundaries.   The Secretaries of State hope that progress will be maintained; their Departments andHM Inspectors will assist.
RESTRICTEDTEACHERSGeneral6.1   Any plans for bringing about improvements in the schools&apos;curriculum and maintaining or raising standards will depend fortheir success not only on the availability of the necessaryresources but also on the full understanding and support of the teaching profession, the quality of its members and theiradaptability to the obliging demands made on them.   The policies of central and local government must recognise this truth ifthey are to succeed.6.2   There are about 459,000 qualified teachers in maintainednursery, primary and secondary schools - about 50% more than in1966.   This additional teaching strength has been used, firs^ireduce class sizes substantially in the last ten years.   In 19^two-thirds of all primary school classes had more than 30 pup1-1by 1976 the proportion had fallen to under half (45%).    Forsecondary schools, the improvement was from 27% in 1966 to 15^ 11976.    In addition, more teachers have been needed to deal wi^growing range of tasks outside the classroom - for example,careers advice, pastoral work and home-school links.6.3   Since 1975? the continuing steep fall in projected birthsthe economic situation have combined to bring the improvement 0staffing standards to a temporary halt.    The Government&apos;stoexpenditure plans provide, however, for sufficient resourcesenable staffing standards within the schools to be maintained their current levels, and additionally for a substantial expanof in-service training and induction in the period up to 198^*It will be the Government1s aim to resume improvement of staiall0standards within the schools as soon as economic conditions a6.4 The increase in numbers was achieved through a major exp ,eof training in the 1960s coupled with strenuous efforts to pe $former teachers to return to service.    In 1973, the peak yeafiRESTRICTED
40,00 newly-qualified teachers completed their training.   the rapid fall in the school population, combined with much reducedwastage from the profession, has however now led to a plannedcontraction of the training capacity.   When this has beencompleted, there will be fewer than 20,000 newly qualifiedteachers each year by the early 1980s.6.5     Both advantages and disadvantages flow from the new situation of reduced wastage and new recruitment.   On the onehand, the recent dramatic improvement in the stability of staffing of some schools in difficult areas has already affordeda very welcome measure of relief.   Widespread inexperience is nolonger so serious a problem as in the recent past:   whereas fiveyears ago the proportion of teachers with less than two years&apos;service was one in five, it is now one in eight, and is likelyto fall further.   This greater stability is already having afavourable effect on educational standards in the schools.6.6     On the other hand, though the normal non-graduate trainingcourse is now of three years&apos; duration, about half (150,000) ofthe non-graduate teachers at present in service were two-yeartrained;   and, as a measure of the movement towards a fullygraduate profession, just over one quarter (120,000) of allteachers are graduates.   The reduction of recruitment
of newly trained teachers limits the rate at which improvedinitial training arrangements can be effective in improving the qualifications and skills of the teaching force as awhole.   This emphasises the importance of measures directed at improving the efficiency of teachers already in service.6.7.     After a period of great and rapid changes in the size and character of the school population, accompanied by continuing reorganisation of the schools system, it would besurprising if there were not some degree of &quot;mismatch&quot; betweenthe needs of the schools and the capacity of the presentteaching force to meet them.    Shortages of teachers ofparticular subjects persist and school curricula have oftenhad to be trimmed to square with the staff available.Whatever remedies may be applied it is clear that, in times ofeconomic stringency, everything cannot be put right at once anpriorities will have to be established for both initial andin-service training.6.8.     Apart from tackling problems of &quot;mismatch&quot;, it remains the intention of the Secretaries of State to secure furtherquantitative improvement in staffing standards as soon aseconomic conditions allow.    The impending large-scale declinein the school population means that this objective no longerrequires the continued growth of the teacher force.    If,for example, this were to remain at its present level, therewould be no fewer than 60,000 teachers by the middle of the1980s available to improve staffing standards.    Even if the teacher force were at a level a little below this during the1980s, a marked improvement would take place year by year instaffing standards.    If local authorities and the schoolsdeployed their teachers with this aim in view, there would oePi EoiiuulLD
hardly any classes of over 30 by the middle 1980&apos;s.   The plansrecently announced for a further contraction of the teacher training capacity to a minimum of 46,000 places of which35,000 will be available for initial training, should besufficient, with the recruitment to be expected from other sources % to support a teacher force at any of these levels andso to allow for a continuing improvement in staffing duringthe next 10 years.6.9.     A coherent approach is needed in which policies forthe initial education and training of teachers, induction,in-service training, and other aspects of the deployment andcareer development of the teachers will combine to providestaffs for the schools better equipped to deal with theirpresent and emergent tasks.    The following paragraphs set outthe provisional ideas of the Secretary of State for education and Science (who is responsible for the supply and training of teachers in England and Wales) on these matters.   Many ofthe proposals described will need discussion with therepresentatives of teachers and local authorities and other interests concerned, and she will seek the advice of theAdvisory Committee on the Supply and Training of Teachers(ACSTT).Initial training6.10.    Major changes have taken place in the size and structure of the system for the initial education and training of teachers, and in the nature and content of courses, in thefive years following the James Report.    Three and four yearBachelor of Education (B Ed) courses have been developed and provision has been made for a proportion of students to followfour year courses.    Some educational interests have advocatedfour year courses for all but lack of resources precludes this development.    The new patterns have not yet had time to prove- ..;..,G:lD
their effectiveness but it will be important to monitor themcarefully and to judge what modifications may be needed.The regional conferences have, however, revealed fairlywidespread misgivings in relation to the following issues:-i. whether entrants to the teaching profession havea sufficient command of the English language andare adequately numerate;ii.   whether teachers have an adequate appreciation ofthe world outside the education system, particular^the importance of industry and commerce to thenational well-being and the problems facing an industrial society like ours in an increasinglycompetitive world;iii.   whether existing courses of teacher education giveenough attention to the role of teachers in a mult1&apos;cultural society;iv.   whether existing courses of teacher education fur^i6^students with the essential intellectual mastery 0^subjects they will teach;v.   whether they provide students     with sufficientpractical guidance to enable them to become effective teachers capable of directing children&apos;work and of ensuring their gppd discipline;vi.   whether the Governmenfs policy of a large measureof integration of teacher education with higher education generally is or is not likely to enhanc6the quality of training and allay the misgiving5referred to above.
HiiiCTED6.11.    The aim of the Secretary of State is that there shouldhe as soon as possible a graduate entry into  the teaching profession and that from 1979 or 1980 the entry to theexisting Certificate courses should be phased out,except forthe shortened courses in particular subject areas for matureentrants with relevant qualifications or experience, and thatthe normal minimum entrance qualifications to BEd coursesshould be 2 GCE passes at A-level.    She proposes also thatentrants to such courses should have qualifications at a minimum of 0-level grade C or CSE grade 1 in English and mathematicsor should otherwise satisfy the institution concerned,and itsvalidating body, of numeracy and literacy to the equivalenti ^ -ilevel.6.12.    The Secretary of State is, however, particularly conscious of the value for the schools of a flow of entrants to teachingwho have broad and diverse backgrounds, experience and interests:she has particularly in mind those who belong to the ethnicminorities or who have had experience of the problems of innercity areas as well as those with a wide variety of industrialor commercial experience.    In her consultations with ACSTTon the proposals for phasing out the Certificate coursesshe has asked in particular for advice on what special measuresmight be necessary to ensure that these categories of potentialteachers have adequate opportunities to qualify themselves for entry to teacher training courses.6.13.    The Secretary of State shares the misgivings of thosewho believe that too many entrants to the teaching professionhave inadequate experience and understanding of the world outsideeducation, including its multi-cultural and multi-racial aspects,and know too little about the problems of an industrial society.Opportunities provided by the integration of teacher educationwith other forms of higher education,especially in technology and business studies, will help to give teachers a betteracquaintance with, and understanding of, the industrial world.
But the Secretary of State is also anxious that, where possible,preference should be given in recruitment to applicants who have had some employment outside the worldof education so that the traditional cycle of school/training/school can be broken and that eventually thegreat majority of teachers will have had at least somepersonal experience of the world of employment outsideeducation for which       most of their pupils aredestined.6.14.     Suggestions have been made that the teacher educationcurriculum should be changed to place greater emphasis onacquainting intending teachers with the national importance 0industry and commerce   and the challenges which our societyas a whole must face.   The Secretary of State believes thatthese aspects should be given greater attention in initialteacher training and that training establishments should makespecific provision to cover them.   They should be better ableto do this effectively if those involved in training includereasonable number with first hand experience of these problem6&apos;6.15.     The Secretary of State shares the widespread view thatteacher education and other higher education should be more closely integrated, both institutionally and in course strucThis policy, together with the phasing out of the Certificatecourse and the raising of entry standards, should ensure thatteachers have a thorough knowledge of their subjects.   It lSimportant that sufficient attention should be paid sto teaching skills and that in more general-purpose institute of higher education the sp.acial resources needed for proie&amp;    ^aspects of training, including practical guidance on the de^ement of classroom skills, should not be lost.6.16.     The Secretary of State has in mind three proposalswhich she believes would help to avert this danger and to reinforce the professional aspects of teacher education.First,    she would like to see introduced a policy %0much greater exchange of teachers between schools ancolleges so that each has a better understanding 0?the other&apos;s role.
0 &apos;11. J i lilUITEDSecond,    she proposes to foster the growth of anetwork of centres of scholarship and professionalexpertise within the reorganised teacher trainingsystem.   She would hope that, over a period, someinstitutions would come to be recognised as national or regional centres of development and resources inparticular fields in relation to initial and in-service training.   Thus a centre might be subject-oriented, or it might specialise in development work for particularage ranges of children, as certain colleges alreadydo; other centres might take the lead in recognisedproblem areas such as remedial education, or the teaching of the mentally handicapped.   Some might make their special contributions in areas of concern toteachers generally, such as the problems of innercity schools or children suffering deprivation, oreducation for life in a multi-cultural society, orthe development of careers education.   Some would bemore directly concerned with professional skills andteaching techniques, others with developments inparticular subject fields, but these two elements arecomplementary and need to be closely related.Third,     the Secretary of State sees a gap in thecurrent arrangements for the development of the content of teacher education and training, in thatthose who are professionally concerned with thesematters at present meet separately under the auspices of the CNAA and validating universities, in committeesestablished by teachers&apos; associations and in UCET.   TheSecretary of State proposes to discuss with the teachers&apos;and other interested organisations how this gap might best be filled.Induction6.17     It has long been recognised that newly trained teacherscould benefit from more systematic help in overcoming the initial problems encountered during their first year of teaching.In 1971 the James Committee recommended improved arrangements which should include, among other things, release of new
teachers from school duties for training for at least one-fifth of their time.6. 18.     Pilot schemes for the induction of newly trainedteachers were introduced, with special financial assistancefrom the Government, in the areas of two local educationauthorities - Liverpool and Northumberland: and several other authorities introduced pilot induction schemes ontheir own account.    The Department of Education and Sciencethrough its research budget is financing work by theUniversity of Bristol School of Education which is promotingand co-ordinating the monitoring and evaluation of the pilotschemes;    and later in the year it will sponsor a conferenceof those most closely concerned in order to draw together the practical lessons which can be learned.6.19.     The Secretary of State considers that the time is riPeto devise more comprehensive arrangements for supportingteachers in their initial period of service on entering the profession, and for assessing their progress during thatperiod.   The general spread of induction schemes within thenext few years should provide newly qualified teachers with more systematic support than has normally been the casehitherto.    It should be possible for the workload and levelof responsibility which new teachers undertake during thisperiod of practical apprenticeship to be reduced and more closely defined, and there should be no necessity for the mordifficult teaching tasks to be assigned to them.   The Secre*of State also envisages that designated experienced membersstaff should be given special responsibility for overseeingtheir work and progress.6.20.     The reduction in the rate of recruitment of newteachers should make these developments possible withoutadding unduly to the burdens of experienced staff; it shouldalso enable a closer watch to be kept on the progress ofnew teachers (for longer than just the first year of serviceif necessary), and a higher standard of practical competencto be required for the passing of probation than was feasiduring the years of severe teacher shortage.    It would be111 \SI RIOTED50.
ItLSllllCUDconsistent with this approach that the status awarded onsuccessful completion of training should be an interim one,and that the achievement of full status, as a passport toa teaching career, should await the satisfactory completionof probation.    The teacher&apos;s permanent appointment might also be deferred until that time, his probationary servicebeing undertaken on a separate contract reflecting hisinterim status and lightened responsibilities.6.21   Clearly such changes could not be introduced immediately;in the meantime the Secretary of State intends to consult thelocal authority and teachers&apos; associations on the best wayto embark on a study of measures of this kind intended toimprove the level of professional competence among teachersat the early stages of their career.In-service training6. 22   Normal in-service training, as distinct from there-training mentioned in paragraph 6.32, is that which everyteacher will   expect to benefit from throughouthis or her career, in order to keep abreast of the subject, toextend and refine teaching techniques, to accommodate to newpatterns of school organisation, or to prepare for newresponsibilities.6.23   The fall in the number of births and in wastage fromthe teaching profession means a declining inflow of newlyqualified teachers to schools, so that there is both opportunity and greater need for in-service training.    At the same timethe shift in school population from primary to secondary willrequire changes in the patterns of employment of many teachersif widespread redundancies are to be avoided.   This will befollowed by a contrary shift if the birth rate recovers.6.24   Already local authorities through professional centres and their advisory services, subject and teachers associations,colleges and universities - especially the Open University -RIB I Hid ED51.
provide a wide range of courses, workshops and conference which enable many teachers, often in their spare time and at considerable personal sacrifice, to improve their qualifications&apos;But provision varies widely from area to area and in someauthorities is quite inadequate:   moreover there is recentevidence to suggest that existing provision has been reduced.Release for full-time training has in particular suffered inrecent years and has been only partially replaced by equivalentpart-time courses.6.25  The Governmenfs expenditure plans (Cmnd 6721) envisageincreasing financial provision for in-service training.   Theexpenditure plans, which are of course subject to annual review   assume that the number of full-time equivalentteachers released for in-service education and inductiontraining will rise from the full-time equivalent of 4,500 in1977 to the full-time equivalent of 18,500 in 1981.6. 26  The Secretary of State&apos;s plans for the reorganisation ofteacher education make provision for resources equivalentto 10,000 full-time places in polytechnics and colleges tobe available in support of in-service training of all kinds,which could include not only longer full-time and part-timecourses but also consultancy services, related for example to school-based training and co-operation in the work of teachers&apos; centres.    In addition, university provision amountsto perhaps 3^000 full-time equivalent places.   The provisionof resources on this scale is a necessary but not in itself a sufficient guarantee that programmes will develop to thescale the Government would with to see.6.2 7 Because of their direct responsibility for the quality of education in their schools and for the complicatedadministrative and logistic arrangements which an expansionof this scale will require, local education authorities will-have the major responsibility for developint programmes ofliiCTEO52.i
in-service education and training.    The Government believethat, to ensure the fullest co-operation of teachers andtraining institutions, each authority should establish advisorymachinery on which both should be fully represented, to helpdevelop its plans.    Many authorities have already done so.6. 28  While the greater part of in-service training will be developed on a local authority basis, provision of longer,more advanced and more specialist courses will need to be organised at sub-regional or regional and sometimes national level.    The Government regret that their earlier proposalsfor regional committees were not acceptable and will putforward fresh proposals on this matter when the working group on the Management on Higher Education has reported.6. 29  Programmes of in-service education and training will need to reflect the special needs and problems of the areaconcerned.    The Secretary of State believes, however, thatoverall there are certain priorities which need to be borne in mind, in addition to the re-training courses referred toin paragraph 6.32 below.    These include:i.     provision for in-service training (and inductionprogrammes) in ralation to the special problems ofmulti-racial schools, immigrant communities and schools in deprived inner urban areas;ii,in.the development of language skills and mathematicalskills at all levels but with particular attentionto the primary stages;improvement of professional competence to recognisepupils&apos; handicaps of various kinds and to counterthem as far as possible;    mainly therefore, butnot exclusively, in the field of remedial educationat both primary and secondary stages;
R ESI RIOTEDiv.     the continuing need for the training of seniorteachers, especially heads of departments and headteachers, for the complex tasks of schoolorganisation and management, including the design and planning of the curriculum, to help them makethe most effective use of all available resources,not least the talents of the school staff itself?in providing for the diverse needs of their pupils*6.30   The Secretary of State believes that, while coursesinvolving substantial periods of full-time release arerequired to meet particular needs, full benefit will onlybe secured if in-service training is focused on the specificobjectives and problems of individual schools and is therefore to that extent school-based.6.31   The Government are making arrangement to channel fundsthrough the Manpower Services Commission for the first year 0retraining and, indeed, initial training of teachers of certaiDshortage subjects listed in paragraph 6.32.    In the longer ^eV^in-service training might be considered appropriate for speclgrants if the scope of such grants were to be widened.    TheGovernment have indicated in their Green Paper on localgovernment finance (Cmnd 6813) that they will discuss withthe local authority associations any proposals for an extensi0of specific grants.Making the best use of our Teachers6.32   During a period of declining pupil numbers, the need to match the changing requirements of the service should he      ^understood and accepted by both teachers and employing authorRe-training, as distinct from initial and from normal in-sertraining, may be necessary, for example to enable teacherssuitable potential to fill vacancies in shortage-subject are3It will include:meeting the need for specialist teachers inthe physical sciences, mathematics, craft,&quot;FSTRIGTED3^.
RESTRICTEDdesign and technology, which are particularly-relevant to the country&apos;s industrial needs and where there have been persistent shortages ofadequately qualified teachers for many years;retraining teachers to work with children ofdifferent ages, to take account of the changes inage structure of the school population;iii.     the further training of suitable condadates with experience in ordinary schools for teaching thehandicapped.6.33   Employing authorities will need to develop moresystematic approaches to the recruitment, career development,training and deployment of their teacher force.   For these purposes, they may well need to improve their availablestock of information about their teachers.   For example,if schemes for the training and retraining of teachers inshortage subjects are to prosper, there must be, as far as circumstances allow, an assurance of employment for thosewho successfully complete their training.    Local authorities will accordingly need to forecast their requirements bysubjects, at different levels of qualification, with somereliability.    Again local authorities will need to study the age distribution of their teachers in relation to particular subjects they are competent to teach;    this may reveal an impending crisis, for example ie the bulkof teaching staff available for a particular subject isnearing retirement age.    The Government in response to an initiative by ACSTT are instituting a 10% sample survey this autumn of the qualifications and present duties of secondary school teachers.    A number of individual authorities havealready decided to extend this in their own areas into acomplete census of their secondary teachers.6.34   The character and quality of the head teachers are by far the main influences in determining what a school sets out to do and the extent to which it achieves those aims,RL3T-RIGTED
as HM Inspectorate^ recent report on &quot;Ten Good Schools&quot;illustrated.    It is thus not surprising that the regionalconferences emphasised the importance of such appointments.Authorities will wish to consider whether their present arrangements are securing the best possible appointments,and also whether they are doing enough by way of training to foster the qualities of leadership and management thata headship requires, both amongst aspirants, in order toimprove the supply of good candidates, and upon appointment and at intervals thereafter.6.35   In some areas school rolls are already falling sharply &amp;reductions in teaching complements are providing necessary.This process is likely to continue and become more widespread,even if it should become possible to allow some improvements 111staffing standards.    Local education authorities are expectedto do all they can to make other posts available for teacherswho are no longer required at their present schools, and in suitable cases to offer them opportunities for retraining.But there can be no guarantee that these efforts will alwayssucceed in avoiding redundancies.    The Government are glad to note that procedures for use in that situation have beenagreed between the local authority and teachers&apos; association5&apos;and commended to individual authorities.    Authorities will only be able to take full advantage of the availability of well qualified teachers of shortage subjects to the extent that less suitably qualified teachers already in post canbe redeployed or retired.Teaching competence6.36   The overwhelming majority of teachers give devoted and efficient service throught their careers.    But there remain5the problem of those teachers at all levels whose performanceotbeclearly falls below any acceptable level of efficiency, anoof the topics on which concern was expressed at the region^nt5conferences.    In a period when more well-qualified applicanare likely to be available than the schools can recruit, a^
those concerned need to deal with this problem.    Some teachersmay prove early in their careers to have made a mistaken choice of profession:    others with the potential for efficient servicemay have got off to a bad start, or may never have receivedthe help and guidance needed to establish their competence.Others, again, after an honourable period of service may find it difficult to come to terms with changing circumstances,or may have become exhausted by the demands of the work.In none of these respects is the teaching profession unique;much the same could be said of other professions.6.37   Just as the causes for shortcomings in performance are many and varied, so are the possible remedies.    Some teachersmay decide in their own interests to seek other careers;occasionally it may be possible to arrange a transfer tosome other post within the authority&apos;s service which is bettersuited to the teacher&apos;s capabilities.    In other cases specialhelp from within the school&apos;s own resources, supplemented by those of the authority, may be the right answer.    So may a systematic period of further training.    In all these mattersan authority which readily offers full consultation shouldbe able to count on the help and sympathetic understanding ofthe teachers&apos; associations, concerned as they must be not onlyto protect their individual members&apos; interests, but also topromote the standing of the profession and the quality ofthe education service.6.3 8  Nowhere is this partnership more necessary than inthe framing of the procedures for handling the difficultresidue of cases where no effective remedy presents itself,and where the interests of the schools would best be served by dispensing with the services of the teacher concerned.Here, above all, local authorities face the difficult task of striking a proper balance between their duty to provideeffective education for the children in their area, andtheir responsibilities as a good employer for the welfare and career prospects of their staff.    The establishment of standard procedures for the assessment of teachers&apos; performance,
for advice, and where necessary warning, to teachers whoseperformance is consistently unsatisfactory, and for all theother steps required by employment protection legislation,or judged necessary as part of a fair procedure for consideringdismissal of staff, are matters which unquestionably call for the most extensive consultation with the teachers&apos;associations.   Once these procedures have been satisfactorilyestablished, and when the distasteful necessity arises forthem to be invoked in a particular instance, the teachers&apos;associations, while immediately concerned to assist any oftheir members in the conduct of his or her case, could resonably be expected to take account of the broaderinterests of the education service in forming their view of the authority&apos;s action.6.39   With the agreement of the local authority and teachers&apos;associations, regulations are now in preparation under the superannuation Act 1972 intended to facilitate the earlyretirement of teachers aged 50 or over on redundancy, or where this would be in the interests of the education service.    The regulations will provide that   whereretirements in these circumstances take place, pensionswill become payable as soon as those concerned leaveteaching, and employing authorities will be empoweredto enhance their accrued superannuation benefits attheir discretion within prescribed limits.6.40   Other aspects of teachers&apos; conditions of service may need to be reviewed through the normal processes of negotiati00between the local authority and teachers&apos; associations in or^erto promote the more flexible and effective deployment of teachers, in the interests of the schools and their pupils-The Secretary of State will stand ready to consider any changeSidentified in the course of such reviews as requiring actionher part, providing they serve those aims.r r,   nn.TF.D
RlSFHICTEDSCHOOL AND WORKING LIFE7.1   In his Ruskin speech the Prime Minister gave specialemphasis to the contribution that education has to make to the nation&apos;s industrial and commercial well-being.His concern about the relevance of present-day education to the needs of industry and commerce were reflected inmany of the comments about this aspect of schools educationat the regional conferences. It was said that the schoolsystem is geared to promote the importance of academiclearning and careers with the result that pupils,especially the more able, are prejudiced against workin productive trade and industry;   that teachers lackexperience, knowledge and understanding of trade andindustry;   and that curricula are not related to the realities of most pupils&apos; work after leaving school;pupils leave school with little or no understanding ofthe workings, or importance, of the wealth-producingsector of our economy.7.2   But there were many equally-strongly expressedcriticisms directed at industry:    for instance that employers often lay down unrealistic standards ofattainment for school leavers well beyond what the jobrequires;   that they have not made allowances for thefact that they are selecting from a group of schoolleavers which is more highly creamed by higher andfurther education than it would have been two decadesago.   And overlying these specific comments was thefrequently-expressed view that if certain occupationsare perceived by young people as unattractive, it is unreasonable to expect teachers alone to remove the restricted
RFSUUCTEDantipathy.    If more able young people are to be persuaded to make their careers in industry and commercethe remedy lies with the companies and firms and onlyto a minor degree with the schools.7.3   Manifestly there is a lack of understanding and communication.   But the picture is not altogethergloomy;   there was encouraging evidence at the regionalconferences that some education authorities were alreadypioneering admirable schemes, including opportunities for visits between industry and schools and working parties to discuss common difficulties, for example inmathematics.   And on a national scale there are someencouraging activities:   the Schools Council Industryproject, and the CBI&apos;s Understanding British Industryproject.   Some of the proposals put forward earlier inthe sections on curriculum and teacher training willmake a contribution here too.7.4   But the key to better understanding lies above allwith local initiative.   There is no lack of possibilities.For example :-i. People with experience in management andtrades unions can be appointed as governors of schools.ii. Industry and commerce should be involved inthe curriculum planning processes at national and local level, to ensure that their points of view are understood.liFST RIOTED
iii. Employers and trade unions, through their first hand experience of industry and commerce, can make significant contributions to careers advice and to improving unstanding of productive industry by offering opportuntiesfor work experience and work observation.Every effort should be made to make full useof such activities and relate them properlyto school programmes.iv. Employers can offer serving and potentialteachers opportunities to gain experienceof working in industry.   They can alsofoster direct contacts between their ownstaffs and teachers in local schools, andthose in education should encourage employers to participate in this way.v.vi.These contacts should be planned in particular to widen the career horizons of women.   A much wider range and variety of job opportunitiesis now available to women.For pupils continuing their education, liaison with universities and polytechnics can help to develop subject interest and open possibilities for further study.   This is especially relevant to engineering which, while it is not generallytaught in schools, is of obvious industrial and national importance.   manufacturing industry recruits some 80% of its graduatesfrom amongst engineering, science and technology graduates, and there has beena shortage of the most able school-leaversapplying to take such courses, particularlyengineering.&apos; RIOTED61.
RlBi RiCTEDvii.   Close liaison between schools and colleges of further education is valuable, especially for pupils in their final statutory year inschool.   Before leaving school every youngman or woman should have the opportunityto visit the local further education collegeto see the range of opportunities it offersand, wherever possible, should receiveinformation about courses available.viii   Pupils should have the opportunity, where appropriate, of taking part in linked courses.The Government are encouraged by thedevelopment of co-operative efforts of thiskind by national and regional bodies.7.5   Opportunities to acquire an understanding of industry should be offered to pupils of all abilities:   theseopportunities are needed not only by those who may havecareers in industry later but perhaps even more by thosewho may work elsewhere so that the role of industrybecomes soundly appreciated by society in general.7.6   It is for local education authorities, schools andindustry to get together and decide which proposals bestsuit them:    this is an area where no amount of centraldirection can take the place of local initiatives.Careers guidance7.7   At the frontier between school and work, the CareersService has a major contribution to make:    this service is now provided in all areas by local education authorities&apos;Careers officers provide vocational guidance and placementservices for pupils in their last years at school.   these officers should have a detailed knowledge of occupationsr?.;crL:P
jobs and training opportunities obtained through closelinks with employers in the area.   Besides dealing with individual pupils, careers officers provide liaison betweenthe schools and industry, advising employers on recruitment,training and induction problems, helping schools to plan andimplement their programmes of careers education, and arrangincareers conventions and other occasions which help to bringthe schools and employers into direct touch.   The Governmenthave already taken action to strengthen the careers service as part of their policy on &apos;Young People and Work&apos;.7.8.     The effectiveness of the vocational guidance offered by the careers service and by the schools themselves mustrely very largely on the foundation which is laid by schoolprogrammes of careers education.   Although most secondary schools have designated one or more careers teachers andalthough work of quality is undertaken, the time and attention allocated to this subject as part of thecurriculum vary widely.   Many schools will need to give greater priority in the curriculum for careers education for all pupils from not later than the age of 13, as recommended in the Department of Education and Science&apos;sEducation Survey 18, &quot;Careers Education in secondary schools&quot;.7.9.     The status of careers teachers within schools shouldreflect the crucial importance of their work.    Long beforethe question of which job to take has to be decided, theremay be important decisions to be taken on, for example,subject options, which will effectively determine whichcareer doors remain open.    In order to make such choices,young people and their parents need systematichelp and advice from teachers and careers officers.
MTRtCTEDSCHOOLS AND THE COMMUNITYLinks with the community8.1     There is an increasing emphasis on the need forschools to become open to the community.   Parents, industryand commerce should be aware of what the education system and individual schools are trying to achieve.   Likewisewithin schools there should be a greater awareness of thecommunity at large; the needs of the nation as a whole;the working of a modern industrial society; and the role of the individual participating in a democracy.8.2     The chief emphasis remains, as in the past, onopenness to those most intimately associated with schools and their interests, such as parents and other relatives.Many schools have made substantial and successful efforts to involve all members of the community in their activities andto make school facilities available to them.    &quot;Communityschools&quot; in some areas offer services to the entire community&apos;Falling school populations will provide new opportunities        qfor wider community use of existing school buildings. Some sCoffer      opportunities for adult education outside normalschool hours, and organise extensive community service byschool pupils.   Facilities may be made available to youthclubs, centres for elderly people and nursery groups.Community involvement of this kind creates problems as wellas opportunities for staff and pupils, and requires a higndegree of dedication and sheer hard work.   Neverthelesswherever such community involvement takes place those concerned are enthusiastic about its benefits.   The Educa^1Departments have long sought to encourage community involvement and the concept of &quot;community schools&quot;.   They promote    ^conjunction with local education authorities design and buiexperiments intended to foster such activity............D64.
Kt5 I K*w i lU8.3   As soon as pupils achieve a degree of independence anda capacity to make decisions of their own about their behaviour,they influence, for better or worse, the lives of others.    Inspite of the community involvement described in the previous paragraph, which has helped many young people to understand the contribution they can make to the wider community, someschools have become associated in the public mind with truancyand vandalism.    It is not the intention to attempt an analysishere of this issue - let alone to apportion blame; but a minority of schools undoubtedly have problems of this kind which require serious attention and sustained action.    Aspart of their educational responsibilities to the children in their care, and in their own interests, schools and teachers must continue to strive for high standards inbehaviour as well as in learning.    Tney will need thesupport of parents and local education authorities.8.4   The entire experience at school contributes to preparation for responsible adult life.    One of the great potential gainsfrom extended education is increased breadth, balance, and independence of outlook.    Education for good health andhappy personal relationships begins in the home, butthroughout their childhood and adolescence young people will be greatly influenced by teaching and example at school.    Attitudes towards sex,  parenthood, smoking, drink and exercise, for example, will be set in these years;and schools should cooperate with parents in preparingyoung people for adult human relationships.Parents8.5   The group most deeply involved with the school must always be the parents.8.6   It emerged clearly from the regional conferences thatparents are asking for much more information about what is happening in schools.    This wish can be met by increasingthe access to parents at times convenient to them already offered by many schools.    More comprehensive and comprehensibleRESTRICTED65.
KtdliilGTEDand to make any observation they wish about the school.Schools should satisfy themselves that individual parentsare aware of the progress made by children and any difficulties they may have and should welcome response tothe information which has been supplied to parents.    Ifleaving certificates for all pupils are introduced(see paragraph 3.1 2), it goes without saying that parentsshould see them.8.7    There is also a place in the system for parentscollectively.   Parent-teacher associations and parents&apos;associations have greatly helped many schools, throughassistance with careers education and co-operation withextra-curricular activities, as well as in such basicmatters as fund-raising.   The report of the TaylorCommittee will cover relationships between parents and individual schools.8.8   Local education authorities should therefore reviewpresent arrangements in their schools, spread good practicewithin their area to all their institutions and consider further improvements on the basis of good practice elsewhereAs part of this process the Secretaries of State will issue to local authorities later this year a circular describing the kind of information about secondary schools that theyconsider should normally be given to parents.   This will include details of size, admission arrangements, the range of courses available, which public examinations are taken,      .pastoral care arrangements and similar matters.    Represent9of local authorities, teachers and parents have alreadybeen asked for comments on the draft of a circular.RlbluiCiEP66.
RESTRICTEDschool reports would also help.   Existing reports, on an annualor termly basis, vary greatly in the amount of information they give.   Parents - and the pupils themselves - have a rightto know how well the pupils are doing in different partsof their schojl work, to have information on their conduct,attendance, and application.   Parents for their part shouldhave the opportunity to comment on how their children are developing
conclusion.1   The studies and discussion of the past year or twohave been, in part at least, a response to anxieties aboutthe performance of our education system.   Some of thoseanxieties arise from misleading or even distorted reportsabout what is going on in the schools.    In this paper,the opportunity has been taken to put the record straight,and to impress upon the world at large that someaccusations of failure are unwarranted.   There are manymajor gains to the credit of our schools.   Some genuineanxieties should be directed elsewhere than at the schools;they have been made scapegoats for other pressures andforces working in society.   But some anxieties are justifiedand this paper makes proposals for dealing with them.9.2   It is right that the Government should give a lead inmaking these proposals.   But because of the way education is organised a major part in carrying them out will fall to others, particularly the local education authoritiesand the teachers with whom continued discussions will be needed, and are planned.    In the short term, remediesrequiring additional resources on a large scale are notavailable, but the Government hope that the case foreasing existing restraints can be met as soon as conditiorlSallow.9.3   Each child&apos;s education is a unique experience.   We,the partners in the education service, owe it to ourchildren to provide them with the best education ourmeans allow.RESTRICTED
PROPOSALS AND RECOMMENDATIONS10.1   During the past ten years major changes of organisationand practice have taken place in our schools.   Primary schoolshave adopted approaches to early education reflecting abetter understanding of children&apos;s growth and development;a fundamental reorganisation of secondary schools is largelycomplete - more than three-quarters of secondary pupilsare now in comprehensive schools.   The Secretaries of Statebelieve that the process of comprehensive reorganisationmust be completed;    secondary education in this Green paper is assumed to be equally available to children of the full range of ability.   Teachers, the churches, and the localeducation authorities have together striven to make these changes:    much has been accomplished.   Now we must look fora period of stability in organisation and improvement in educational standards.   This is the common thread runningthrough the proposals that follow.10.2   The education system in England and Wales depends oneffective co-operation and consultation between the educationdepartments, the local education authorities and the teachers(Paragraphs 1.14 - 1.15).10.3   It is an essential ingredient of this partnership thatschools should be accountable for their performance:accountable to the local education authority (and those whoelect it) as part of the public system of education;accountable through the school governors and managers to thelocal community that they serve.   The Taylor Committee were required to examine the relationship between school governors and the local community as part of their study of schoolgovernment.   The Secretaries of State look forward towidespread discussion of the Committee*s report which isto be published later this year (Paragraphs 1.14 - 1.15)10.4   Special help must be given to children who are disadvantagedby social, environmental or other handicaps.    This may requirepositive discrimination in the use of resources (Paragraph 1.13)
10.5   Nursery education needs to be more closely co-co-ordinated with other provision for the under-fives, especially wherechildren suffer from disadvantaged backgrounds.   The DESand the DHSS hope shortly to issue a joint circular onthis matter (Paragraph 2.30).CUERICULUM10.6   The design and management of the school curriculumplay a central part in determining the educational standardsachieved by our schools.   Much enlightened and intelligentdevelopment has taken place already, but existing practiceneeds to be reviewed as a preliminary to defining a newframework.10.7   The Secretaries of State propose a review of curricula1&quot;arrangements, to be carried out by local education authority66in their own areas   in consultation with their teachers, aSa preliminary to consultations on the nature of any advice which might be issued to local education authorities oncurricular matters (Paragraphs 2.1Q - 2.22).10.8   They will in the light of the review seek to establish a broad agreement with their partners in the education service on a framework for the curriculum, and on whetherpart of the curriculum should be protected because thereshould be aims common to all schools and to all pupilsat certain stages.   These aims must include the achievement of basic literacy and numeracy at the primary stage(Paragraphs 2.3, 2.18).10.9   As an element of this review the Secretaries of Statepropose that local education authorities should examine andreport on their existing practices in relation to records of pupils&apos; progress (Paragraph 3-20).
10. 10 In addition to their responsibility for the academiccurriculum, schools must prepare pupils for the transitionto adult and working life.   Care must be taken to see thatgirls do not, by subject choices, limit their careeropportunities.   Young people need to be equipped with abasic understanding of the functioning of our democraticpolitical system, of the economy and the industrialactivities which create our national wealth.(Paragraphs 2.13, 2.14, 7.1 - 7-9).10.11    The traditional division of labour between men andwomen is rapidly breaking down.   The curriculum shouldreflect this by educating boys and girls according to their needs and capacities as individuals and not according tosexual stereotypes.   Both sexes should learn how to cope with domestic tasks and with parenthood (Paragraphs 1.2o,2.14).10.12   Our society is a multicultural, multiracial one,and the curriculum should reflect a sympathetic unstanding of the different cultures and races that now make up oursociety.   We also live in a complex, interdependent world,and many of our problems in Britain require internationalsolutions.   The curriculum should therefore reflect our need to know about and understand other countries(Paragraphs 1.10 - 1.12).10.13   In Wales local education authorities should formulateclear policies for the Welsh language in their schools.   Thecurriculum review proposals in this paper should cover this aspect in Wales (Paragraph 2.27)10.14 The Secretary of State for Wales is consideringrequests from several bodies for specific grants to bemade towards the cost of bilingual education (Paragraph 2.28).
ASSESSMENT10.15   There must he coherent and soundly-based means of assessment for individual pupils, for schools and for the educational system as a whole.10.16   The professional competence and knowledge of teachersis of prime importance in assessing individual pupils.   the assessment of Performance Unit will yield tests of value for this purpose.   The education departments will encourage the development of such tests.    It is hoped they willbecome widely used by schools;    greater consistency of practice can only be beneficial (Paragraphs 3-9i 3.10).10.17   Local education authorities need to be able to assess the relative performance of individual schools taking accountof examination and test results, reports by inspectors and advisers, and self-assessment by the schools.    But &apos;leaguetables&apos; based on examination or standardised test results in isolation can be seriously misleading (Paragraph 3-7)*10.18   The Assessment of Performance Unit is concentratingat present on the development of tests suitable for nationalmonitoring in English language, mathematics and science.It will embark on a programme of national assessment of theschool system in 1978.   The work of the Unit will not provide a basis for assessing individual schools, whichmust depend on the detailed knowledge of the circumstancesof these schools (Paragraphs 3.4 - 3-6)-10.19   Local experiments in the provision of leavingcertificates for pupils will be kept under review.   the secretaries of State will consider the possibility ofcommissioning a national study (Paragraph 3-12, 3-13)
10.20   The Secretaries of State are considering the SchoolsCouncil&apos;s proposals for changes in the examinations normallytaken at 16+.   The Secretaries of State will discuss withthe Schools Council the possibility of fitting exploratorywork on a &quot;grouped certificate&quot; into their current programme.There is no intention of abandoning single-subject examining(Paragraphs 3.14 - 3.18).10.2&apos;1   The Secretaries of State reject the idea that rigidand uniform national tests should be applied to all children at certain ages (Paragraph 3*11 )TRANSITION BETWEEN SCHOOLS10.22   Substantial problems can occur at the point of transition between primary and secondary schools and whenfamilies move from one area to another.   The difficultiescan be reduced by :a. regular contacts between the teachers concerned;b. co-ordination of primary and secondary schoolcurricula and assessment procedures;c. good record-keeping practices(Paragraphs 3-1, 4.2, 3.8, 3-19.)SPECIAL NEEDS OF MINORITY GROUPS10.23   A Committee of Inquiry on education policy towardsethnic minorities is under consideration.   A wide range of bodies is being invited to give their views on statisticalmonitoring as a basis for positive policies towardsequallising opportunities and on encouraging young people from the ethnic minority groups to enter teaching(Paragraph 5-2)
Mv ;cted10.24   The Warnock Committee will give close attention tothe question of  integrating handicapped children intoordinary schools   (Paragraph 5*5).10.2[)   Extra resources need to be directed to the alleviationof disadvantage in such areas as the inner cities(Paragraph 5.6).TEACHERS10.26   It is upon the supply of good teachers in adequatenumbers that the strength of the education system must rest.There is no hope of implementing successfully the proposals in this paper without the full understanding and supportof the teaching profession.   The key to the quality ofthe profession lies in standards of recruitment, intraining and in career development:    it is upon these aspects that this section therefore concentrates.10.2V    It remains the Secretaries of State&apos;s intention tosecure further improvements in school staffing standardsas soon as economic conditions allow (Paragraph 6.8).10.2 8   The aim of the Secretary of State is that thereshould be as soon as possible an all-graduate entry intothe teaching profession.   The existing Certificate coursesshould be phased out and the normal minimum entrancequalification to BEd courses should be 2 A-levels.   entrants to such courses should also have qualifications at aminimum of 0-level grade C or CSE grade 1 in English andmathematics or should otherwise satisfy the institutionconcerned and its validating body of numeracy and literacyto the equivalent level (Paragraph 6.11).
10.2n   The Secretary of State believes that preferencewherever possible should be given to applicants for teachereducation courses who have had some employment outside theworld of education.   She has particularly in mind maturestudents and those who belong to the ethnic minorities.She is consulting with the Advisory Committee on theSupply and Training of Teachers (ACSTT) on what special measures might be necessary to ensure these categories of potential teachers have adequate opportunities to qualifythemselves for entry to teacher-training courses(Paragraphs 6.12 - 6.14)10.yO   The Secretary of State considers that specificattention should be given in initial teacher training toacquainting teachers with the national importance ofindustry and commerce and to the need for children to betaught about participating in a democratic society.Attention should also be given in courses in all collegesto the importance of training to teach in a multiracialsociety (Paragraph 6.13).10.31   To reinforce the professional aspects of teachereducation, the Secretary of State supports proposals for :a. the introduction of a policy for many moreexchanges of teachers between schools and colleges;b. the growth of a network of centres ofscholarship and professional expertisewithin the teacher training system(Paragraph 6.16)
10.32   The Secretary of State intends to consult the localauthority and teachers&apos;  associations on measures to improveinduction training, and hence the professional competence of teachers at the early stages of their career(Paragraph 6.2l).10.33   The Secretary of State considers that each localeducation authority should establish advisory machinery to develop programmes of in-service education and training for teachers.    She will herself put forward new proposalsfor regional or national level courses when the working group on the Management of Higher Education has reported(Paragraphs G.27, 6.2fi).10.34   In the longer term, in-service training is an area wh1might be considered appropriate for specific grants if thescope of such grants wore to be widened (Paragraph 6.31)*10.35   Local education authorities should develop moresystematic approaches to recruitment, career development,training and deployment of teachers.    After consultationwith ACSTT, the Government are instituting a 10% samplesurvey this autumn of secondary school teachers, whichwill indicate how their time is divided between teaching and other duties (Paragraph 6.33).10.36   The Government believe that senior and experiencedteachers should devote as much time as possible to teaching(Paragraph 6.29)..H Of110.37   Regulations now in preparation under the Superannua0Act 1972 are intended to facilitate the early retirement 0*teachers where this is in the interests of the education service.    Other aspects of teachers&apos;  conditions of servicemay need to be reviewed in order to promote the more flexible and effective deployment of teachers in the n),interest of the schools and their pupils (Paragraphs 6.39*
SCHOOL AND WORKING LIFEIO.38   Schools and industry must work closely together.There are already admirable schemes - national and local -in operation, but much more needs to be done and it isclear that great scope for improvement exists, particularly for local initiatives.10.39   Communications between employers, trade unions andthe schools need to be improved.    Joint efforts shouldrelate to such matters as improving understanding of theimportance to our national life of productive industryand trade, and the provision of work experience as partof a school course (Paragraph 7*3)10.40   Schools and firms should establish links at locallevel.   Consideration should be given to the appointmentof managers and employees as governors of schools.   It isimportant that those engaged in industry and commercevisit schools, as well as school pupils visiting factories and offices   (Paragraph 7.4).10.41   Industry, the trades unions and commerce should be consulted in the curriculum planning process (Paragraph 7.4)10.42   Local education authorities, schools and industry should consider in the light of local circumstances how best to collaborate in careers education and work experience(Paragraph 7.4)10.43   Every school child should have the opportunity to visit the local further education college, and shouldbe given information before leaving school about coursesavailable there (Paragraph 7.4)
10.44   Careers education and the Careers Service have important contributions to make to improving arrangementsfor the transition from school to work.   Schools may need to adjust their priorities to make room in the curriculumfor careers education for all pupils from not later thanthe age of 13 (Paragraph 7-7)SCHOOLS AND THE COMMUNITY10.4 3 The community can be more involved in the schoolsif school buildings and playing fields are available for community use (Paragraph 8.2)10.4 6  Schools  should encourage parental involvement(Paragraph 8.2, 8.6).10.4 7   Links between schools and the community can be strengthened through community service by pupilr(Paragraph10.4 8 A Circular will be published later this year setting out the information that should be available to all parentsabout schools (Paragraph 8.8 )10.4^   The Taylor Report on school government will put forwaproposals for involving parents in the local administrationof schools (Paragraph 8. 7)
