Amendments to thePrevention of Fraud(Investments) Act 1958A Consultative DocumentPresented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for trade by Command of Her majesty july 1977LONDON;R MAJESTVS STATIOI25p net
ForewordOn 21 October 1976, the Secretary of State for Trade announced in theHouse of Commons a number of measures designed to improve supervision of the securities market. These measures included the intention to amend thePrevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958 as soon as opportunity permitted.Supervision of the securities market in Great Britain is partly statutory,partly self-regulatory. This Consultative Document outlines proposals tostrengthen the Department of Trade&apos;s regulation of the statutory part of thesystem to make it better adapted to developments in recent years in commercial and financial practices. The proposed amendments are mainly concerned withimproving and extending the system for licensing dealers in securities; reducingthe range of those eligible for exemption from the licensing arrangements;stiffening the restrictions on invitations to the public to invest; and revising the penalties laid down in the Act.

introduction. The Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act 1958 is largely a re-enactment of a 1939 Act of the same title, which in turn was based upon the recom-mendations of the Anderson Committee on Fixed Trusts (1936) and theBodkin Committee on Share-pushing (1937). Amendments have been made from time to time, but only of a minor nature, and much of the present Actis in effect still designed to deal with the commercial and financial practices ofthe 1930s. In the Department of Trade&apos;s review of the supervision of the securities market, the opportunity was taken to consider what amendmentswould be necessary to strengthen the Act&apos;s provisions to take account of present-day conditions. Consideration is also being given to the possibilityof extending the provisions of the Act to cover Northern Ireland, in the interestsof ensuring uniformity in securities legislation throughout the United Kingdom.2. At this stage, it is not proposed to amend the sections of the Act dealingwith authorised unit trusts. The Commission of the European economic community has recently prepared proposals for a draft directive on theco-ordination of national laws concerning collective investment institutions fortransferable securities; if a directive on these lines is in due course approvedby the Council of Ministers, implementation in the UK will then entailamendment of the existing legislation covering authorised unit trusts.3. The remainder of the Act falls conveniently into three parts: regulationof the business of dealing in securities; exemption of certain categories ofdealers; and investment frauds and their prevention (this last category notbeing concerned solely with securities).4. The main areas in which it is considered that the Act needs updating(some of which were pointed out in the Report of the Company Law Committeechaired by Lord Jenkins: Cmnd 1749) are as follows:(a) the range of occupations covered by the provisions of the Act forlicensing dealers in securities needs to be widened;(b) fuller information should be required from applicants for licences;(c) there should be provisions for suspension as well as revocation of licences;(d) the case for granting Orders of Exemption to certain types of dealerneeds to be reconsidered;(e) restrictions on invitations to the public to invest, whether in the formof circulars, advertisements or other ways, should be strengthened andthe activities of agents of overseas companies brought within the Act;(/) the financial penalties laid down in the Act, and the deposit to be paidby licence holders, should both be increased.In addition, the Licensed Dealers (Conduct of Business) Rules 1960,(regulations made under the Act and providing for the proper conduct ofbusiness by licence holders) require revision to make them better fitted topresent-day conditions.
5. Subject to certain specific exemptions, the Act makes it an offence to carryon the business of dealing in securities (including units of authorised unit trusts)except under the authority of a licence issued by the Department of Trade. TheDepartment has powers (which are in practice very restricted) to refuse orrevoke a licence. It is required to issue licences provided that application is madein the prescribed manner and, in the case of a principal^ licence, is accompaniedby a deposit of  500 (to be lodged with the Supreme Court) or a surety for thesame amount. Refusal or revocation of a licence is subject in certain circum-stances to the right of the applicant or licence holder to request that the matterbe referred to a Tribunal of Inquiry, whose members are appointed by theLord Chancellors Department and the Treasury.6. The term &quot;dealing in securities&quot; is defined in the Act; but the scope of the licensing system does not at present embrace a number of investment advisers and investment consultants, whose activities may include investment on behalfof clients. Their numbers and activities have greatly increased in recent yearsand the distinction between those requiring to be licensed and those free to operate without a licence has become blurred. The Government proposestherefore that persons offering an advisory service for the management orinvestment of securities in return for a fee (whether related to the value of the securities or not) should be licensed either under the same system as dealersin securities or under a separate system but with similar terms and conditions to those applied to dealers. It is not intended however that those who advisetheir own clients on such matters incidental to their professional function(for example, solicitors and accountants) should be brought within an extendedlicensing framework. An amendment on these lines would also permit licensedinvestment consultants to distribute investment circulars to their clients withoutrisk of contravening section 14 of the Act.7. The opportunity will also be taken to review the present deposit arrange-ments for licence holders. The amount of the deposit ( 500) is now too small inpresent-day values; and it is also for consideration whether the nature of the deposit might be changed to make it more comparable with a fidelity bond.A bond of a specified sum, eg  5,000, or representing a certain percentage ofturnover, might be deposited. It could have the dual function of demonstratingthe substance of the licensee; and might also be drawn upon, if necessary, tomeet any deficiencies arising from, for example, negligence or fraud on the partof the licence holder. In order to maintain a degree of flexibility, it is furtherproposed that the amount of the deposit or bond should be specified inregulations which would also deal with the arrangements for accepting, holding and releasing the deposit or bond.8. Experience in administering the licensing provisions of the Act has shownthat, in certain respects, they are not sufficiently flexible. As the Act requires theSecretary of State to issue a licence in specified circumstances, it has not alwaysproved possible to refuse or defer a decision upon a licence application whenother circumstances have shown that further enquiry should properly be made.Although proposals in paragraph 12 below go some way to meeting this
difficulty where the Department of Trade is making enquiries under section 109of the Companies Act 1967, there may well be other occasions when it would be proper to defer a decision on an application for a licence. It is proposed, there-fore, that the Department should have discretion to defer a decision on a licenceapplication pending the completion of all or any enquiries which may be madeby, or on behalf of, the Department. Further, once all enquiries were completed,it might be deemed to be in the public interest to suspend a decision on anapplication for a specified period. Notice would be given in writing to theapplicant that such a suspension had been effected; and would be less harsh,and perhaps less damaging to the applicant^ reputation, than an outrightrefusal. Similar rights of appeal as exist against refusal of an application couldbe adopted. It would seem in accordance with the underlying principles of theAct that a licence to deal in securities should only be granted when theDepartment is satisfied that the applicant is a person or body in whom theinvesting public may reasonably place its confidence.9. There is also a lack of flexibility for taking action where necessary against an existing licence holder. At present revocation of a licence is the sole remedyavailable to the Secretary of State. In certain circumstances (eg if matters came to light which called for investigation) it would be desirable to have powers to suspend a licence immediately for a specified period. Such suspension wouldbe subject to appropriate rights of appeal.10. Only about half a dozen cases have been referred to the Tribunal of inquiry constituted under the Act. The Tribunal has to consider an appeal by an individual or a company held by the Department of Trade to appearnot to be, or no longer to be, a fit and proper person to hold a licence to deal in securities. In taking such a decision, the Department must strike a fine balance.On the one hand if the standard of proof of &quot;unfitness&quot; is set too high, an undesirable person might be allowed to deal (or continue to deal) in securities,with consequent risk to investors. On the other hand, the career or livelihoodof a licence holder or applicant might be damaged by requiring an unrealisticstandard of &quot;fitness&quot;. The Tribunal is faced with a similar problem. One way in which the Tribunal might be helped in its difficult task would be to amend the law so that relevant information derived from enquiries under section 109of the Companies Act 1967 could be made available to the Tribunal where this information related to a company whose licence or application was underconsideration. In the case of a successful appeal it might be particularly important for the investing public to be aware of the basis for the Tribunals decision.An amendment is therefore being considered which would enable the Secretaryof State (taking into account any recommendation on this subject made by theChairman of the Tribunal) to publish the Tribunals findings.11. The conduct of licensed dealers is governed by rules made under the Act.The present rules were drawn up in 1960 and it is intended to update themamongst other things to keep them in line with amendments made to the parentAct. Comment has already been received from interested bodies on possibleamendments to the rules. For instance, those governing takeovers will need tobe amended to make them compatible, as far as is practicable in statutory regulations, with the present City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. Rules
should be introduced for share exchange schemes and certain other transactions,and also to govern the conduct of investment advisers, if these are to be brought within the scope of the Act.12. Among other changes affecting this part of the Act, the government propose that:(i) all offences proved by courts-martial should be disclosed by a licenceapplicant;(ii) provision should be made for the revocation of a representative^licence when the holder ceases to deal in securities;(iii) where a principal licence holder is a corporation, a valid representative^licence should be held concurrently by an eligible person;(iv) as section 109 of the Companies Act 1967 applies only to corporatebodies, and licence holders may be individuals, or trade as partner-ships, the Department of Trade should have the power to inspectbooks and papers of non-corporate licence holders;(v) licences issued under the Act, which are at present valid for one yearonly, might in future be made valid for periods of up to, say, five years,after satisfactory completion of a probationary period on an annuallicence.Exemption of certain categories of dealers13. Although the Act provides for the licensing of persons carrying on thebusiness of dealing in securities, it also provides that certain categories ofpersons may be exempted from the licensing system. Two such categories are members of a recognised stock exchange and members of a recognisedassociation of dealers in securities. Recognition of such bodies is subject torevocation or variation but, apart from technical revocation arising frommergers, no such body has had its recognition withdrawn since the provision was enacted.14. There is however a third category of exempted persons that has given riseto some difficulty. This category -&quot;exempted dealer&quot; was included in the1939 Act in order to avoid the necessity for banks, discount houses and similarinstitutions to apply for a licence to deal in securities. At that time it wasconsidered that exempted dealer status would be granted to relatively fewinstitutions whose dealings in securities formed only a small part of their totalactivities; or which were concerned with &quot;wholesale&quot; dealing rather thandealing with individual members of the public. This concept has howeverbecome distorted with the passage of time and the emergence of new forms offinancial institution. Moreover this scheme has given rise to some problemsbecause one class of authorisation has been thought to be of higher status thanthe other; there is evidence to suggest that an Order of Exemption is sought bysome dealers as a status symbol rather than as a practical means of securingexemption from the relevant provisions of the Act. Therefore the coverage ofthe exempted dealer category has been reviewed. It is proposed to confine the
v of the present discretion to the banks, insurance companies and similarbodies that are, or will be, subject to statutory supervision in their main field of activity; and to employ the licensing system to meet the needs of other kinds of financial institution.15. Powers will be sought to enable the Department of Trade to seekinformation on the resources and reliability of new applicants for exemption.Similar powers will be sought requiring the disclosure of such information by existing exempted dealers.Investment frauds and their prevention16. Emphasis on the prevention as opposed to the detection of fraud is contained in those provisions of the Act that place a general prohibition on thedistribution of circulars inviting investment. The Act deals not only withinvestment in securities, but also in any property (eg land, wine) which apromoter may wish to use as a vehicle for his investment invitations. In orderto permit bona fide commercial transactions to take place unhindered, the Actprovides for certain activities to be exempted from some of its restrictions.Also, prohibition on the distribution of circulars does not apply where the recipients are professional dealers in securities. As with other activities regulated by the Act, developments in investment practices in the past few years have made clear the need to strengthen and clarify the Act&apos;s provisions.17. One clarification might be to define more closely the persons orcategories of persons who may receive circulars, the distribution of whichmight otherwise be prohibited. This would remove the existing doubt as to the precise categories falling within section 14(5) of the 1958 Act. It would bepossible, for example, to draw up a list of such persons in the form of a statutory instrument made under the Act. The list would be revised at suitable intervalsand issuers of circulars would have readily available information on those persons who could receive investment circulars without restriction.18. When the 1958 Act was drawn up, it was intended that explicit permissionby the Department of Trade for the distribution of individual circulars undersection 14(2) of the Act would need to be granted only rarely. Closer definition of the categories of persons which may receive circulars without restrictionwould contribute towards the reduction of what has in fact materialised asa disproportionate workload on individual permissions. In addition, it isproposed that the Department should in future charge a fee for this service,which, in line with Government policy, would be set at a level sufficient to cover the full cost of the service. The alternative would be to achieve the necessarypublic expenditure savings by withdrawing the service completely, referringapplicants to licensed or exempted dealers or other suitably qualified bodies.It is recognised however that the latter course might cause some hardship,especially to smaller companies.Miscellaneous19. Tightening other definitions would also help to clarify the Act&apos;s intentions.For instance, it is proposed to review the definitions of &quot;securities&quot; and &quot;dealingin securities&quot;. In addition, the definition of &quot;circular&quot; will be redrawn to lessen
the existing confusion surrounding the term, making clear, for example, thatnewspaper advertisements come within the scope of that definition. Con-sideration is also being given to the possibility of clarifying the provisionsconcerning agreements and arrangements in section 13 of the Act (which lays down the penalty for, and defines the offence of, fraudulently inducing persons to invest money).20. The financial penalties for offences covered by the 1958 Act will need tobe substantially increased to reflect present values more closely; this will includeimplementation, where appropriate, of the provisions of the Criminal Law Bill,currently before Parliament. The opportunity will also be taken to review themode of trial for offences under the Act, as well as other penalties.21. There are other amendments, mainly of a technical and consequentialnature, which will be proposed when draft legislation is laid before Parliament.Such amendments will have the effect of strengthening the underlying provisionsof the Act; for example, bringing the investment promotion activities of agents in the United Kingdom, acting on behalf of overseas companies, within its scope.Submission of views22.

Nearly fifty orfianisaLioi^jIn recent years there has &quot;been increasing public interest in and discussion of the role of companies in society and their widerresponsibilities, beyond those towards shareholders and creditorsupon which company law has hitherto been based.    Consideration of company responsibility towards employees, customers and societygeneraliy as well as towards shareholders and creditors was, forexample, given in the CBI report &quot;The Responsibilities of theBritish Public Company&quot; published in 1973-    More recently, the role of employees in their companies and the relationship betweenemployees and shareholders has been considered in depth in the&quot;Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Industrial Democracy&quot;(the Bullock report) published in January 1977* (Ch%^A. dsJoiA.2.   Acknowledgment of the wider responsibilities of companies hasled to suggestions that the content of company reports and accountsshould be extended to reflect the wider accountability of the directors of companies, and cover the interests of others besidesshareholders, to whom the reports are at present addressed.An important contribution to the consideration of wider disclosureRequirements was provided by the accountancy profession in thediscussion paper &quot;The Corporate Report&quot;, published by the AccountingStandards Steering Committee in July 1975.    &quot;The Corporate Report&quot;considered the information needs of a vaniety of potential users of a company report and put forward proposals for extending boththe financial and non-financial information to be included in such reports in order to meet the needs of users.    These and other proposWere considered in a preliminary draft paper &quot;Aims and Scope of company Reports&quot; prepared by the Department of Trade in May 1976and circulated on an informal basis to a number of professional,industrial and commercial associations.
and individuals provided written comments on &quot;Aims and Scope&quot;and these contributions have been valuable in drawing up the prosepaper.3-    The following sections of this paper set out the presentposition on disclosure in company reports and the way in whichreports are already evolving to meet the wider responsibilitiesoutlined above.    The paper then discusses the general approachtowards company reports, and the manner in which new requirements for disclosure may be introduced.    The main part of the paperconsists of an examination of a number of specific proposals for new items for publication in company reports and accounts.    an indication is given in each case of the Government&apos;s view on thedesirability of the proposal, and a summary of the proposals isprovided in the final section.    The paper as a whole is a consultative document on which comments are invited by 31 December1977.
2.    THE PP. ESEI-IT POSITION4.     Under the Companies Acts 1948 to 1976, the directors of a company are required to prepare annually and to lay before the shareholders in general meeting audited accounts showing a trueend fair view of the state of affairs of the company, togetherWith, a report by the directors.    Minimum contents of the accounts and of the directors report are prescribed in the legislation, butthe form in which those contents are to be presented and the methodto be followed in drawing them up are the responsibility of the directors.    However, the form and method have been generallydetermined by accounting practice and more recently by standardsdeveloped and applied by the accountancy profession.5.     There are a number of reasons why it is timely for the Govern-ment to review the form and content of company reports and account:The discussion of wider corporate responsibility and accountabilityMentioned in the Introduction, is one.    In addition, it has become clear that the basic legal requirements relating to financialreporting by companies are no longer fully adequate, at least for&quot;the larger companies.    Companies listed on the Stock Exchange have&quot;to provide more information than that required by the Companies Actand in certain areas accounting standards have been developed tocover matters not required to be disclosed by legislation.    Furthermore it will be necessary to revise the content of company accountsset out in Schedule 8 of the 1948 Act as amended by Schedule 1 ofthe 1967 Act and introduce legislation regarding form and methods0-I accounting in order to implement the e.c. Fourth Directive onCompony accounts, which may be adopted shortly, and to take account0f the introduction of current cost accounting.
6.    The draft e.c. Fourth Directive prescribes both the content and the format of company accounts, and the methods of valuationto be used.    The introduction of current cost accounting willitself be a major development in company reporting, and one whichhas the support of the Government.    As is well known, the develop-.Kent of an Accounting Standard on current cost accounting is being discussed by the accountancy bodies.    The revision of Schedule 8to take account of these developments will however be the subject of separate proposals by the Government, and is not considered further in this paper.
5.    INTRODUCING HEW REQUH?ETIENT37.    The following sections of this paper consider1, in turn, anumber of proposals for new items for inclusion in company reports and accounts.    Certain of these items are already published on a voluntary basis by many companies; for example the inclusion ofa statement of added value, in the accounts of larger companiesat least, is increasing, and there is already an accounting standardfor a statement of source and application of funds but no legislativ&quot;backing for this requirement.    In other cases it seems unlikelythat disclosure would become widespread unless there were a clearlegislative requirement.8.    In considering any proposal for extra disclosure in companydeports, a number of criteria need to be applied.    The most importancriterion is whether publication will clearly assist those witha direct interest in the company to gain a better understanding ofthe affairs of the company as a whole or a significant part of it.But there are other considerations which tend to limit the amountQf information to be disclosed:  is the information already available or would the cost of collecting and presenting it be prohibitive?Is there a danger of revealing information of value to competitors?A particularly important criterion is the need for the information  -in company reports to be both accurate and timely; the Companies Act^976 tightens up the requirements on the length of time allowed for companies to file annual reports.9.    The above considerations have influenced both the selection of^dividual items discussed on the later sections of this paperaftd the recommendations made in each case.    These recommendationsdelate only to the contents of the annual report and accounts; it
ic however recognised that there in a welcome trend to more fr.equer.ireporting on the financial position of companies.    In the case oflisted companies fes&amp;^a&amp;ssir^: reports are required by the Stock Exehanrand some companies issue quarterly financial reports.    It is not suggested that the new items discussed in this paper should be incorporated in interim financial statements.10.    The Government already has substantial powers under the CompaniAct 1943 to require further disclosure in company accounts.    It isintended to seel: an extension of this power to cover the contents of&quot;the directors&apos; report and methods of accounting as well as the contents of accounts, so that the Government may -by Order alter orextend the form and content of any part of company reports and accounts.    The use of this proposed Order-making power will cover the introduction of a revised Schedule 8, referred to inParagraphs 5 and 8 above, the introduction of new reporting require-ments and the modification of existing requirements.    It is proposed&quot;that, before any new requirement is introduced under an Order, thereWill be prior public consultation on the proposal, and an Order whievincreased disclosure requirements would be subject to affirmative resolution before adoption.&apos;*    It is intended to bring the whole of theRequirements of company reports and accounts into a single consoli-^ated. Statutory Instrument, to be updated whenever a major change is made, to avoid the confusion which can at present arise throughhaving to consult a number of different Acts and Orders to establish&quot;the current disclosure requirements of companies.
6A12.     The proposals in this paper have been considered with largecompanies in mind.    It is not intended that smaller private companies should be subject to the full range of new disclosurerequirements, and there may well be a good case for exempting&quot;them from all or most of the requirements now proposed.    TheGovernment has not decided on detailed exemption limits,out suggests that only larger companies, employing more than500 people or with turnover exceeding  5 million, should berequired to produce a report embodying all the recommendationsttade in subsequent sections of this paper.    It is expected thata separate review of the reporting requirements of small comparJ.esWill be necessary before revising Schedule 8 to cover currentcost accounting and the e.c. Fourth Directive.
zl      STATEMENT OE ADDED VALUE13.    There is a growing tendency for listed companies to preparestatements of added value, either as part of their auditedaccounts or more frequently as a supplement to them.    Inthe Government&apos;s view, the added value statement is a usefuladdition to the financial information produced by companies.A company1s turnover is in part the result of other people&apos;work, namely the raw materials, products and services whichthe company has purchased from outside, and in part the resultof the efforts of the company&apos;s work-force and the use of itsphysical and financial assers.    This latter part is thevalue added by the company, and can therefore be expressed as turnover less goods and services purchased from outside.14.    Having identified the added value, it is then of interest toshow how it has been distributed   by way of payment to employees to those who have provided the capital by way of dividendson share capital and possibly interest on loan capital.and toGovernment through taxation; and indicating the balanceretained in the business.15.   Care is needed in using added value as a measure of wealthcreation, and in interpreting changes in added value.    but with this proviso, the identification of added value provides a useful&apos; indication of performance, to supplement other financial information.The information required to produce an added value statement is readily available to companies.    Preparation of the statement
calls   for the re-ordering of information already revealedin the profit and loss account, together with disclosure ofcertain information which does not at present have to hepublished.    The Government has concluded that there shouldhe a legislative requirement that companies should publishsuch statements.    The Government envisages a requirementframed in general terms, with the detailed rules on the methodof preparation and form being suitable matters for prescriptionby Accounting Standard; this would provide flexibility forcompanies such as banks or insurance companies where   atpresent there are special disclosure requirements, and wherethere may be a case for different forms of added valuestatements.    However, in order to provide a measure ofconsistency in preparation, the Government believes that addedvalue statements should be subject to audit.There are a number of issues which will need to be clarifiedconcerning/  the method of preparation and content of such statements,including the form of presentation of a added value statementunder current cost accounting, but there are two further points which call for particular comment at this stage.    First,although the concept underlying this statement, the concept of &apos;added value, also provides the basis for Value Added Tax, thereare many technical rules about the calculation of the liability for VAT, including for example zero rating, which effectivelydistinguish questions of tax liability from the information tobe provided, in an added&quot; value statement.    In&apos;introducing the requirement for an added value statement, it is not the intentioto use this statement as a means of checking VAT liability,nor would it be possible to do so.    The second point is thatit has been argued that the added value statement should show
not simply the Corporation Tax liability on the profits, butalso all or as many as possible of the payments made to central and local government.    A similar issue arises in relation tothe statement of source and application of funds (see paragraphs ZXf-c is^.    in the context of the added value statement,the argument needs to be examined further; there may begrounds for seeking to distinguish between, for example,Corporation Tax liability, which is directly related to one part of added value, namely profits, and. other payments, suchas rates or excise duty on petrol, which are frequentlyindistinguishable from costs payable to third partiesfor bought-in materials and services.    Torequire companies to show all payments to Government would impose appreciable additional burdens on them.    A better coursewould seem to be to follow the normal analysis by type ofexpenditure, as is adopted in the profit and loss account,and to require the added value statement to be prepared onthis basis.
&apos; JiiH^yment St a t omcnt18.A requirement was introduced in the Companies Act 1967 that,where a company employs 100 or more people, the directors1 reportttust state the average number of UK employees and their aggregateremuneration during the year.    It is proposed that this limitedObligation to disclose information about employees should be expanded into an employment statement with wider coverage, to reflect the importance of the human as well as the financial resources of companies.is not, however, intended that the employment statement should seek to duplicate the detailed information on pay levels andCa-tegories of employment which are to be made available to employeesfor the purpose of collective bargaining under the recently adoptedcode.    Hor should the proposed employment-&quot;statement be confused withthe separate reports made by many companies to their employeescovering the companies1 activities.* ^hat is proposed is that companies should publish an employmentstatement which sets out information about its workforce and employment^clicies which are relevant not only to employees themselves but toshareholders and others concerned with the company.    The aim is toProvide sufficient information about the workforce and about the^ay in which the employment resources are managed to give an&quot;&quot;-^dication of the effectiveness of management in this crucial area*&quot; the company&apos;s activities, and the way in which the company isGeting its social obligations with respect, for example, to theGaining of school leavers or the employment of the disabled.1 It   -J-S not intended at the outset to lay down a full range of detailed^hirements for the employment statement.    This is a new departure
and it is expected that the form.that the statement will takewill evolve over the next few years, once the broad requirement to publish an employment statement lias been introduced-    It issuggested, however, that the statement should, in addition tothe information at present required on/^number of UK eimployees3(Ve- fcivt rvuYvL number cj- Cty^-yL^^S ofand their pay,jc^se^^fealr-e^^ the company or group.Where the company has significant overseas operations the geographical breakdown of employees is to be included in thedisaggregation statement, see paragraph 4o   .    In respect of itsUK operations at least, the employment statement should then cover:numbers joining and leaving the company duringthe year, possibly showing school-leavers separately,also those retiring and made redundant.-     employment and training policies of the company and its subsidiaries in the UK, including informationofabout educational and training fe^ii)^.ir5fss^^those under 19-unions recognised by the company for collective bargaining purposes, and a short statement of the collective bargaining arrangements.employment participation arrangements.numbers of man-days lost per year as a result ofindustrial disputes within the company,pension and sick pay arrangements.-     numbers of disabled people employed, and a short statement of how company personnel practices cater for those who are disabled.When the provisions of the Health and Safety at Work Act 197^-^elating to the inclusion in the directors&apos; report of information relating to health and safety are implemented, it is proposed thatMlls information; vi:M also form part of the employment statement.
(o. STATEMENT OF SOURCE AND APPLICATION OF FUNDSc- The inclusion of a statement of source and application of funds(or flow of funds statement) is now becoming increasingly commonin company accounts and an Accounting Standard, SSAP 10, was issued in July 1975-The main purpose of the statement is to show how the operations of a company have been financed and how its financial resourceshave been used.    The statement also provides other information which is of value in understanding a company&apos;s affairs, forexample:(i)    to what extent funds becoming available to the.company have been invested in either fixed or working capital;(ii)   the amount and.proportion of funds generated withinthe company;(iii)   the change in net liquid funds.The  Government believes that a statutory requirement for a flow0f funds statement would be a useful complement to this currentdevelopment in accounting practice.    It would require the statement&quot;to be included as part of the audited accounts and would specifygeneral terms the contents of the statement.    Detailed provisions&quot;Would be contained.-in an Accounting Standard.    SSAP 10 does notdictate any particular method of presentation and companies would&amp;e free to decide the most convenient or appropriate format for&quot;their own business.
25. Flow of funds statements for companies with subsidiaries shouldhe based on the group accounts.
. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS- The present disclosure requirements in respect of borrowingsare inadequate in that no details are called for in respect  -of debts payable within five years.    A reader of accounts istherefore unable to make a reasonable assessment of the timing of the repayment of a company&apos;s borrowings.    Ar present separatedisclosure is required under the Companies Acts of the aggregateamount of bank loans and overdrafts, the aggregate of other loans(other than bank loans and overdrafts) which are repayable eitherwholly or in part more than five years from the date of the balance sheet (information is also required to be given about terms of repayment and rates of interest of these other loans) and ofmadeinter-group indebtedness.    Recent regulations/under the Protection1963of Depositors Act/also include provisions requiring particulars of the repayment terms of short-term loans.    The draft e.c. FourthDirective on company accounts proposes separate disclosure ofdebts becoming due and payable within one year and after morethan one year in respect of each category of debt payable by thecompany.    It also calls for similar disclosure of amounts becomingdue and payable after more than five years.    Accordingly it isproposed that in respect of (a) bank loans and overdrafts,(b) inter-group indebtedness and (c) other-borrowings, there shallbe required under UK legislation, where material, a note to the accounts analysing each of these amounts in aggregate between those due on demand, those due in one year or less but not on d.emancthose due between one year and five years as well, as those due inftore than five years.    Rates of interest and terms of repaymentwould also be required to be disclosed in respect of borrowingWithin categories (b) and (c) above.    Particulars of     significantindividual amounts due within more than one year but not more than
five years should also be given.    Where the information v/oulresult in a statement of excessive length a summary of eachof the above matters should be given.
LEASING AND SIMILAR REVENUE COMMITMENTSHire purchase and leasing transactions are examples of items which can commit a company to payment of considerable sums whichare not necessarily disclosed by the present requirement to showseparately amounts charged to revenue for hire of plant and machinery.    A further consequence may be that the company hasthe use of assets, the value of which is not fully recorded inthe accounts.    At present, there is some dispute in accountingand financial circles as to whether these commitments and assetsshould be shown as such in the balance sheet or by means ofa note to the accounts.    This is a matter which requires furtherconsideration, and the Government is not therefore suggesting that either method is the more appropriate but rather that,whichever method is adopted, full disclosure should be made.It is therefore intended to require that, when no provisionfor these commitments is made in the balance sheet, they should,where material, be disclosed in a note to the accounts.    Further,&apos;under both presentations, a note should provide, as with shortterm debt, an analysis of the aggregate amount of leasingcommitments etc broken down into those of&quot;less than one yearduration: those lasting between one and five years; and thoseof more than five years.    An indication of the nature of the assets involved in the transactions should also be given.
DISCLOSURE OF PENSION COMMITMENTSThe Occupational Pensions Board, in its   report on the SolvencyDisclosure of Information and Member Participation in occupational Pension Schemes, February 1975 (Cmnd 5904),recommended that consideration should be given to the inclusionof specific information about pension schemes in companyaccounts or balance sheets.    The effects of inflation on pension schemes have made the need for clearly establisheddisclosure requirements more pressing, and the Government hasbeen considering the case for a statutory requirement for appropriate disclosure.Disclosure of pension commitments would go further than adescription of the company&apos;s policies and practices on pensions which may be included in the employment statement (seeparagraph  2.I    ).    Rather it should consist of all informationnecessary for an assessment of how far the financial positionof the company might be affected by its commitments and obligations in respect of pension arrangements.The whole question of how the company&apos;s pension commitments canaffect its overall financial position is a particularly complexone.    There is a range of schemes, some with invested funds^jsss^^^^^s^s^^c&amp;a^ some financed by the purchase of insurancecontracts and some unfunded; and within each category thereare wide variations between schemes, so that the commitments ofa company depend upon the details of the particular scheme.
In many cases, the potential obligations of the company willturn upon the views taken of the future course of wages and salaries and rates of return on investments over the next thirtyor forty years; for many companies,  it will be the longesttimescale over which they and their professional advisers arerequired to take a view in assessing the company&apos;s liabilities.In these circumstances, it is perhaps not surprising that there. is a wide variety of ways in which companies presently report-on their pension obligations.    This question is being studied by the Accounting Standards Committee.The Government proposes that there should be a legal requirementframed in broad terms for companies to provide separateinformation in the accounts on their present and futureliabilities in respect of pensions.    The Government would look to the development of appropriate professional standards to lay- down the methodology to be followed in assessing theseliabilities and the format to be used in presenting the informa-tion.
TRANSACTIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIESIt is considered that the present statutory disclosure requireracnt relating to transactions in foreign currencies could hestrengthened in order that the users of accounts may obtain a fuller understanding of the trading results and financialposition of a company.    At present, disclosure is required undithe Companies Acts of the basis on which foreign currencieshave been converted into sterling, where the amount    of the assets or liabilities affected is material.    However, suchdisclosure is, by itself, inadequate in a number of ways.First, it does not facilitate the assessment by the users of as toaccounts/whether or to what degree there may be an exchangerisk attaching to assets and liabilities held in foreigncurrencies,  since such assets and liabilities are not requiredto be identified.    Second,     unless the foreign currencytransactions are of an exceptional or non-recurrent nature,or unless extra-statutory information is provided, the accountswill not disclose the extent to which the-profit or loss forthe year is materially affected by exchange gains or losses.Third,  , where a policy of deferring exchange profits or lossesis given in a statement of accounting policies, such disclosureis of little value unless the amounts of the deferred exchangeprofits or losses are also identified.    Finally, the CompaniesActs do not specifically require the identification of allmaterial categories of foreign assets and liabilities or of otherwise transferable amounts held in &quot;blocked&quot; currencies,thereby failing to ensure the disclosure of particular exchangerisks.
34-.   Many ox these deficiencies are iret by current accountingpractice, and the Accounting Standards Committee is about toissue an exposure draft on treatment of foreign currencytransactions generally.    The Government however suggeststhat there should be a requirement for disclosure of materialassets and liabilities held overseas or denominated in foreigncurrencies, identifying any predominant currencies.    It is also proposed that disclosure should be required of material amounts in blocked currencies which the directors consider are nottransferable to the UK.    In addition, with regard to accountingpolicies, it is suggested that the present requirement, to disclose the basis on which foreign currencies have been converted into sterling,  should be extended to cover also thetreatment and amounts of exchange profits or losses arisingduring the period covered by the accounts.35.    It is suggested that directors should be required to comment onsignificant exchange matters in their annual report to share-holders.
- 21 -11.    DisSE^RC:; AND &quot;KVEIOIrlF;&apos;!&apos; IS/Clvv&quot;L&apos;ITURiD36-    The future prosperity of many companies depends to a significantextent on the success of their research and development programmes,  since in. many sectors of industry failure to keep pace with the rate of innovation of competitors is likely to lead to steady if not sharp decline.    At present there is norequirement for companies to disclose information relatingto their R&amp;D expenditure, although some companies do sovoluntarily.In a recent exposure draft, the International AccountingStandards Committee proposed that companies should disclose&apos;  the amount of R &amp; D expenditure incurred during the period covered by the accounts.    The Government considers in principlethat there are sound reasons for implementing this recommendationWhere it is significant in relation to the scale of a company&apos;activities, R&amp;D expenditure constitutes an important investment for. the future, generally out of revenue which would otherwise be available to increase a company&apos;s immediate profit.    Share-holders, employees and other concerned with the companytherefore have an interest in knowing what the company isspending on R &amp; D.    In addition, trends in net profits from year to year may be difficult to interpret satisfactorily ifinformation on R &amp; D expenditure is not disclosed separately,whereas the disclosure of such information together with a note of the amounts carried forward at the beginning and end ofeach period, will reveal the effect of R &amp; D expenditureon&quot; profits&apos; generally, including the extent to which profitsmay have been maintained by deferral or by a cutback in thatexpenditura
The UK Accounting Standards Committee has advised the IABCthat, because of difficulties in defining research anddevelopment, the requirement to disclose R&amp;D expenditure should he dropped.    The Government doubt whether the problemsof definition are insuperable; particularly when a main objective of disclosing R&amp;D expenditure is to show year onyear variations in a company&apos;s activity in this field.    Itis proposed to hold discussions with the UK accountancy bodieswith a view to implementing the IASC recommendation.
9. Under Section 1? of the Companies Act 19&amp;7, directors have,subject to certain exceptions, to disclose in their report an analysis of the turnover and the profit or loss before tax, oran approximation to it, betxveen what are in the directors&apos;  opinionsubstantially different classes of business.    No further guidanceis offered on how directors should categorise classes of business and furthermore the figures or approximations thereto .form part of a directors&apos; report rather than the accounts and aretherefore not subject to audit.    The requirement has not worked well because it leaves too much to the discretion of directorsand as a result the information disclosed has been of only limitedvalue.    There is no statutory requirement for analysis by geographicarea, although the Stock Exchange does require listed companies toProvide a geographical analysis of turnover and of contributionto trading results from those trading operations carried on by thecompany or group outside the United Kingdom.* Separate information about the different classes of a company&apos;business and about the geographical location of its business andcontribution to trading results is important for a true appreciation0f its financial situation and. prospects. Furthermore, the european economic Community is bringing forward requirements for analysis inche draft fourth Directive and OECD Ministers have recommended a set of voluntary guidelines to multinational enterprises operatingthe OECD area which, inter alia, call on such companies tPublish information (subject to requirements of business confide:^lity and cost) on:(i) operating results and sales by geographical area and saleln the major lines of business for the enterprise as a whole.onti-
ii) significant nev, capital investment by geographical area,and as far as practicable, by major lines of business.iii) the average number of employees in each geographical area.The Government considers that the value to be placed on theinformation in question will be much enhanced by requiring it tform part of the accounts, and thus subject to audit, ratherthan the directors&apos; report, where there is no such requirement.The Government proposes that for the company&apos;s activities bothin different lines of business and in different geographicalaboutareas, information should be disclosed /  turnover, profits,capital employed and employment.    It is recognised that theremay be problems in allocating certain costs or elements of fixeor working capital, particularly where there are transactionswithin a company between different reporting segments.    Itmay be appropriate to leave these matters for an AccountingStandard, which might also need to provide guidance on whatconstitutes a line of business or geographical area forthis purpose.    The geographical locations of a company&apos;s assetswould provide guidance on the choice of geographical area,though it is not suggested that separate results should necessarily be provided for each and every country in whichthe company has assets; selection or grouping of areas would depend on a test of their significance to the business.Because the analysis by geographical area is based on activitycarried out in these areas rather than sales to these areas,the Government considers that information about sales indifferent areas should also be provided, with an indication ofany particular dependence on one market.
Turning to analysis by lines of business, the Government-considers that the appropriate starting point is the StandardIndustrial Classification, with which many companies arealready acquainted in the context of existing statisticalenquiries.    The Classification contains 27 Orders, or broadindustry sectors, and it is considered that where a company&apos;activities span two or more of these Orders, then analysisby lines of business should at least cover separately theactivities under each Order heading; some test of significancewill need to be developed to determine which lines of businessmerit the disclosure of separate information about them.Where companies produce consolidated accounts, it would normally be sufficient for the requirement for disaggregated analyses toapply only to the consolidated figures.
Attention is being increasingly focussed upon the extentto which companies contribute by their performance in international trade to this country&apos;s balance of payments;and. it has been suggested that companies should bo required treport more fully on this aspect of their activities.    Thepresent position is that under Section 20 of the Companies Ac196?,  subject to certain limitations as to amount of turnoverand some other exceptions, directors are required to disclosea company&apos;s direct exports of goods.    There is no requirement to disclose imports.It is proposed that companies should be required to disclose the total amount both of direct exports and direct imports,in a new statement of international trade.    Such a statement would however give:   only part of the story, particularly inrelation to imports where a considerable proportion are made through intermediary UK based undertakings which act as agent To prepare a -comprehensive statement of international trade would require a company to state the ultimate destination of its products and the import content of its purchases.This would be a very difficult task for many companies andthe cost could be prohibitive.    A simpler alternative mightbe for the directors to give, in addition to information on direct exports and imports, a separate estimate of indirectin casesimports/where the information is readily available and thevolume of business concerned is significant in relation tothe company&apos;s operations.
47.    I!&quot;a statement of international trade along the lines indicated above were adopted, this would replace the currentrequirement for the directors to report on exports.    It wouldprobably be appropriate to raise the existing exemption limits for companies required to make such a statement, and the currentprovisions enabling the directors of a company not to discloseinformation if it v/ould not be in the national interest to do so would probably be maintained.
The information given in a company1s annual report and accounts is, by its nature, largely historical.    Shareholdersemployees, creditors and others concerned with the company are however also interested in its prospects, but there arelimits to the extent to which historica.1 information in theannual report can be used as a reliable guide.    Many company&apos; reports already contain a short general assessment of theoutlook as part of a chairman&apos;s statement, and it is proposedin the draft e.c. Fourth Directive on company accounts thatthere should be a formal requirement for the annual reportto give an indication of the likely future development ofthe company.    It is therefore appropriate to consider whatthe content of a statement of future prospects might be.There are a number of objections to the suggestion thatcompanies should publish financial forecasts with their annual report and accounts.    To minimise the likelihood ofmisleadingly optimistic forecasts being published, it is con-sidered essential that the same strict standards should applyas with forecasts which accompany a prospectus or takeover bidBut the independent examination necessary for suchforecasts would add to the expense of preparing thereport and might possibly lead to delays in reporting.A more fundamental objection is that however soundlybased the forecast may be at the time it is made,unforeseeable changes in circumstances may invalidatethe assumptions underlying a forecast to the extent that
it becomes seriously misleading unless it is updatedduring the course of the year.The above considerations appear to rule out, for the timebeing at least, the inclusion on a regular basis offinancial forecasts in a statement of future prospects.But it is suggested that companies do have furtherinformation, within the limits of commercial confidentialitywhich it would be helpful to disclose as an indication of future prospects, to supplement the assessment of thegeneral outlook for the company.    Orders in hand are one possible indicator in some industries.    Another useful contrbution might be to give information, beyond the amounts of future capital expenditure commitments already requiredto be disclosed, on major new investment projects, withan indication where appropriate of the likely effect on employment.    Certain other matters which are relevant tothe future of the company are discussed under separateheadings:    for example, research and development expenditure and the statement of short-term borrowings, but some reference to these matters might also be appropriate ina statement of future prospects.    It would seem reasonablefor the statement also to include any currently knownfacts which were likely to affect materially the futureof the company; for instance, the expiration of animportant patent or licence.These examples give an indication of how a statement of future prospects might evolve.    The Government believes
that it would, be a useful development for companies to publish more information about future prospects on thelines indicated above, but considers that further studyis necessary before any decision could be taken as towhether to introduce detailed guidelines covering a formalrequirement for a statement of future prospects.
&apos;S SOCIAL ACCOUNTING52. Social accounting is a term which, covers a range of ideas, manyof which are at a very early stage of development.    At its simplestit involves reporting, largely on an ad hoc basis, on individualitems such as anti-pollution   or health and safety measures whichmay be of greater importance for their social impact than fortheir financial effects on the company.    More radically, socialaccounting involves a reappraisal and re-presentation of theinformation about a company in social benefit rather than strictlyfinancial terms.^3. Some individual items with a largely social interest are discussedelsewhere in this paper, notably in the section on the employmentreport. Social accounting on a comprehensive basis is, however,in an experimental phase, with debate about the underlying conceptsand with details of the necessary measurement techniques not yetagreed.    For the present the Government considers that developments in social accounting should take place outside the framework of legal requirements for disclosure in company reports and accounts.ENERGY USAGECompanies have been asked voluntarily to report on theirenergy usage and to make clear their commitment to energySaving. Government policy on energy conservation is underreview and one proposal which may be considered is to makea statement on energy usage a requirement in directors&apos; reports.At the minimum this would involve reporting the total annual expenditure by the company   on fuel.
/% SUHTiAKY AND conclusions.   The various proposals for new or strengthened disclosure require-ments, considered individually in the earlier sections of this papneed to be considered also from the point of view of the contributthey can make to the development of a coherent structure forcompany reports and accounts which should reflect the widerresponsibilities and concerns of the company, and the performance of the directors in meeting these, rather than the traditionalapproach which concentrated on the financial interest of share-holders   and creditors.-   Against this background the Government proposes that, for largercompanies, the annual report and accounts should in future contain the following elements:-- an &quot;added value statement, to show the wealthcreated by the company and the way in which that wealth is distributed.- an employment statement, to indicate the manpowerresources and policies of the company.- more comprehensive financial accounts, basedupon a new version of Schedule 8 of the CompaniesAct 1948, &quot;to include statements coveringsource and application of funds, short term borrowings,leasing arrangements, obligations to pension funds and also giving more details of transactions inforeign currency.-   more detailed djisaggregation of the activities of thecompany by type of business and geographical area of operation.
- An internnoral trade statorient to show imports into as well as exports from the UK.The Government intends to give further consideration towhether companies should disclose their total R&amp;Dexpenditure/in their accounts, and to whether companies should be subject to a general requirement to publish aa statement of future prospects.&apos;-f].    As indicated in paragraph  fO   above, it is intended tointroduce these proposed requirements under a. new Order-making power to be sought in a forthcoming Companies Bill.Before laying Orders relating to any of the new itemsdisclosed in this paper, the Government intends to publishseparate proposals for the revision of Schedule 8 and willalso provide where appropriate more details of the information to be required in the new items to be added to the reports and accounts.58The development of comprehensive reporting by large companiesis an evolutionary process and the proposals set out above are to be considered as only one stage, although an important one, in that process.    As experience develops with the newrequirements proposed here, they may be modified or extendedunder the proposed Order-making procedure, after furtherconsideration and consultation.    This evolutionary approach should ensure that company reports do not become overburdenedwith unnecessary detail which might obscure rather than helounderstanding of the company&apos;s operations, and that the costs of collecting and publishing the information are kept within reasonable bounds.
In putting forward these proposals the Government believes that it is       taking an important step towards ensuring that company reports give a broader and more balanced viewof company operations while, at the same time, improving the quality of the financial accounts.    Reports and account in the form proposed will be more valuable to all those concerned with a company, whether shareholders, employees,creditors, customers or the Government.
