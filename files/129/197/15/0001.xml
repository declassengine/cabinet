Document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government cp(77) 85 copy no g 25 July 1977cabinetDISPERSAL:  MINISTRY OF defence memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal and theSecretary of Scate for scotland. This paper recommends agreement tc the dispersal of a package ofMinistry of Defence (MOD) posts which will meet the Governments commit-ment to the programme announced in 1.974.background. Numbers.    Under the programme announced in 1974, the MOD are due to disperse some 6, 000 posts to Glasgow and some 5, 000 to Cardiffsubject to possible reductions resulting from reviews of the defence programme.    The Cabinet agreed on 9 December 1976 (CM(76) 40thConclusions, Minute 3) that there should be no basic departure from the dispersal programme, but invited the Ministers concerned to considerwhether any adjustment should be made to the MOD figures in the light ofthe projected reductions in MOD staff.    It has subsequently been agreed thatthe number of MOD posts for dispersal to Cardiff shall be &quot;4, 000-5, 000&quot;,instead of &quot;5, 000&quot; as in the 1974 announcement.3. Timetable.    The dispersal building programme has been delayed bythe economy measures announced in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;sstatement in December 1976.    The revised timetable was approved by the ministerial Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy (El) at their meeting on 3 May, subject to further examination of the timing of the MODmove to Glasgow.    We have discussed the position with the Secretary ofState for Defence and the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,Department of the Environment (Mr Kenneth Marks MP) and explored thepossible options.    But it has not yet been possible to agree on a firm basis for the dispersal plan for Glasgow.RECOMMENDED SOLUTION4. The options which have been explored involve three main blocks ofwork, namely: -
a. Service personnel and civil staff management and the DefenceCodification Authority - some 2, 300 jobs with associated common services including 300-400 Service personnel.b. Service and civilian pay - some 4, 000-4, 500 jobs,. including750 Service personnel.c. Quality Assurance - up to 2, 800 jobs, of which 1, 600 are at woolwich and a further 1, 000 at Bromley.For convenience, further details are given at Annex C.5. The Quality Assurance groups are not suitable for central Glasgow;the move of 1, 600 jobs from Woolwich has been questioned by Ministers on social grounds;  and to move either or both groups of staff would be veryexpensive.6. If we set Quality Assurance aside only options drawing on both 4a.and b. above would meet our announced commitment.    We believe that thebest solution would be to disperse to Glasgow the groups of staff listed in annex A.    This solution provides about 6, 000 jobs, offers the prospect ofa large building on the Anderston site by 1983-84 and another at St Enoch&apos;sto be ready for phased occupation during the period 1985-88.    But the timetable would be extended well beyond 1984 and this will be severely criticised in Scotland.    We have had to accept that there is now no possibility of advancing the time scales.7. This solution which is subject to a feasibility study poses majortechnical computer problems, and entails putting another large computerisedclerical operation in the Glasgow area.    Most of the jobs involved are currently located outside the London area, and to that extent the plan i.o a departure from Hardman and could intensify Staff Side opposition.     Werecommend that the MOD should be allowed discretion to go for a differentmix for the Anderston site provided that numbers are not reduced and thetotal building programme is not delayed.8. The Secretary of State for Defence believes that to accommodate two large groups of staff on 3eparate sites, and to move the Service personnelstaffs, would have an adverse effect on operational efficiency.    We observe that the two sites in Glasgow are near one another, and furthermoreMinisters have already acknowledged that the dispersal programme carrieswith it some administrative disruption.    We also recall that the MODincluded the move of Service personnel management staff in their initialdispersal package.2
COSTS9. Compared with the figures submitted to Ministers in May, there is an overall reduction in expenditure of  7.2 million within th.3 period covered bythe 1977 Public Expenditure Survey.     A clear decision to go ahead now willenahle the Property Services Agency to acquire the Anderston site in1977-78, at a cost of  1. 5 million which they can find within their allocation.If acquisition h&amp;s to be deferred to 1978-79 they will need an additionalallocation to accommodate it.REVISED DISPERSAL TIMETABLE10.        It is now three years since we announced a 10-year programmefollowing our consideration of the Hardman Report, and seven months since we had to initiate a reassessment.    Since December we have been under constant pressure nationally and of particular intensity in Scotland to announce our revised intentions.    The forbearance of our supporters inParliament, and among the local authorities and others in the Glasgow area,is now sorely tried and we cannot expect them to wait longer.    Nor can weafford to do so, especially as the extended timescale now inevitable for the glasgow dispersal programme as a whole is bound to be very badlyrecsived and criticism would be greatly intensified if no clear announcementwere made until September or October.    Politically and presentationally,therefore, we cannot justify any further delay in making a firm announce-ment of our intentions.11.        To make an announcement in clear and unqualified terms willanticipate the outcome of the feasibility study which is being made of the pay and records option.    But an announcement which reserved this majorelement in the Glasgow package pending continuing study would at this latestage be extremely damaging.    We believe that the time has come when wecan delay no longer but allow for limited flexibility in the St Enoch numberswithin the range indicated in paragraph 4 above.12.        A copy of the revised timetable is at Annex B in the form approvedby El subject to resolution of the MOD issue, and now incorporating ourrecommended solution for the MOD move to Glasgow.    We recommend thatthis announcement be made before the Summer Recess.CONCLUSION13.        We invite colleagues:a.       To agree that ths MOD should adopt the solution described inparagraph 6 above as the basis for fulfilling their dispersalcommitment to Glasgow.3
b. To agree that the revised dispersal timetable should now be announced in the terms shown at Annex B.PB MCivil Service Department25 July 19774
