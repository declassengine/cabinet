DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

THE UK PRESIDENCY 1977

FOREWORD

Introduction

1. This report in the series presented to Parliament by the Government on

Developments in the European Communities is of a special nature because it

covers the period of the United Kingdom Presidency of the Council of Ministers

which ran from 1 January to 30 June 1977. The United Kingdom has been

responsible during that period both for the internal organisation of the Com-

munity&apos;s work and for its external representation. The Prime Minister has

presided at meetings of heads of governments in the European Council where he

has been accompanied by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary. British

Ministers have chaired all meetings of the Council of Ministers where the

United Kingdom interest has accordingly been represented by a colleague, as

shown at Annex 19. A record of the more important developments in the

Councils and other institutions of the Community is given in the other Annexes

to this Report. The following paragraphs give a more general account and

summary of our Presidency.

2. In accordance with custom our Presidency opened with a statement of

our aims for the Community in a keynote speech delivered to the European

Assembly by the Rt Hon Anthony Crosland MP as President of the Council of

Foreign Ministers. He laid stress on the need to strengthen the organisation of

the Community, to consolidate its achievements, to improve the operation of

existing policies, to promote convergence between the economies of the Member

States and to develop the Community&apos;s influence in the world. Mr Crosland&apos;s

speech was widely welcomed in the Community, and there was deep regret when

his untimely death cut short the promise of his contribution. However his

realistic vision of the way ahead for the Community informed our approach to

the Presidency, and the themes which he distinguished have been those which we

have continued to emphasise.

The Role of the Presidency

3. The work of the Community is complex and varied and progress is

conditioned by previous developments and external events. The scope for new

initiatives and radical changes within a six month period is therefore limited.

The role of the Presidency is largely to identify possibilities for progress in

on-going business, to reconcile differences between the Member States and to

provide leadership. The conduct of the Community&apos;s business and its relations

with the rest of the world place a substantial load on the Government holding

the Presidency. The Community has continued during the British Presidency to

suffer from the consequences of world-wide economic recession which have

limited the scope of pursuing the goals of growth and convergence in the

economic performance of Member States. However, a large measure of unity

has been maintained during our Presidency in facing these difficulties, in

developing relations with other countries and economic groupings and in

carrying forward the internal policies of the Community, despite the present

harsh economic circumstances which have affected all Member States.

1


4. We have been guided in the day to day conduct of business by the view

that the Community can develop only by serving the interests of all its members.

British spokesmen have therefore continued to pursue our national interests in a

manner consistent with those of the Community as a whole. There has been

some criticism of our Presidency for lack of restraint in this respect. But dis-

agreements are inevitable on matters where the interests of Member States do

not coincide and we have sought to exercise our Presidential responsibility both

to find an equitable balance of advantage and to concentrate attention on areas

of common interest and of benefit to all.

The European Council

5. The two European Councils under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister

were generally regarded as useful and productive. Problems which had arisen in

the organisation of some earlier Councils were overcome. In Rome on 25-26

March the Council gave priority to policies for tackling world economic

problems, for promoting growth and economic convergence among Member

States, and for reducing inflation and unemployment. In London on 29-30 June

they were able to record significant progress with these policies and to approve a

programme of further action notably by the European Investment Bank. The

two Councils also marked progress in the Community&apos;s relations with the rest

of the world, including Japan, the Middle East, Africa and the developing

countries.

Foreign Affairs

6. In the field of Foreign Affairs the Presidency played a leading role in the

preparation and conduct of the Community&apos;s international relations. We

contributed substantially to the progress made in UNCTAD and the CIEC, to

the success of the joint Ministerial Council of the Lome Convention, and to the

work of the Development Council. Further impetus was given to the General

Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Multilateral Trade Negotiations (GATT MTNs).

Serious discussion of the questions raised by the prospect of further enlargement

of the Community was undertaken. Good progress was made in the negotiations

for Greek accession and work was begun on the Portuguese application for

membership. The Community&apos;s endeavours to develop its economic and

trading relationships with the Mediterranean countries were brought within

sight of a successful conclusion. Good relations were maintained with the

European Free Trade Area Countries and further progress was made in im-

proving relationships with Eastern Europe and Far Eastern and Latin American

countries. Nearer home, the Member States took concerted action to extend

their fishery limits to 200 miles; and the Community entered into negotiations

with a number of countries, including the Soviet Union, Poland and the GDR,

on fisheries arrangements. These developments reflect the increasing influence

of the Community in the world, its role in representing the interests of its

members and its readiness to work for a more equitable and stable world

economic order. The economic problems for the Community of enlargement are

not to be underestimated, but the Community must support democracy and

social justice among its neighbours.

Political Co-operation

7. Political co-operation between the Member States in the co-ordination

2


of their foreign relations is a special responsibility of the Presidency and was

developed and strengthened during our term of office. London was the centre

for an intensive programme of meetings and of the communications network

linking directly the Foreign Ministries of the Nine. Apart from their formal

meetings, the Foreign Ministries of the Nine were engaged in continuous

consultation at all levels over a wide range of foreign policy matters. In par-

ticular a comprehensive and consolidated position was agreed for the CSCE

Review Meetings at Belgrade. The Nine displayed an active concern for African

questions, with valuable support for the United Kingdom over Rhodesia. They

maintained close diplomatic contacts with the parties involved in the Cyprus

dispute and restated their position on the Middle East. The groundwork was

laid for increased co-ordination among the Nine at the United Nations.

Economic and Financial Affairs

8. In the economic and financial field our Presidency has been responsible

for urging forward important programmes of work on growth, inflation and

employment. First, a common Community position calling for additional

international financing was worked out for presentation to the International

Monetary Fund (IMF). Secondly the Community agreed on the need to stimulate

world economic activity on lines which were endorsed at the Downing Street

Summit meeting. Thirdly attention was given to measures to promote employ-

ment, and constructive discussions on this problem took place in the Tripartite

Conference held at the end of our Presidency. The Community has also under-

taken the reappraisal of some of its major financial measures. Agreement in

principle was reached on the review of the Social Fund. Following an invitation

from the European Council the European Investment Bank intends to increase

its lending to promote investment. Work has started on a review of the Regional

Development Fund. These developments are designed to strengthen the

economies of the Member States and to promote their convergence.

9. We also carried forward during our Presidency the Community&apos;s work on

financing its budget wholly from its own resources; agreement was finally

reached on a common basis for charging value added tax. Progress has also

been recorded in the developments of Community energy policy and in the trans-

port field towards a common Community system of &quot;whole-vehicle&quot; type

approval which promises when complete to bring significant benefits to trade

within the Community.

10. There are problems yet to be resolved within the Community on many

issues. Work has continued on the revision of the common fisheries policy

which is a pressing but difficult matter involving serious economic, social and

political problems. Similarly, there are continuing problems in the operation

of the CAP. The divergences of interest which exist in the Community of Nine

will take time to resolve. The fixing of Community support prices this year was

contentious but it marked progress towards a better balance of interest between

producers and consumers which is held by many to be in the long term interests

of the Community.

3


11. When Britain joined the Community we subscribed to the aims of the

Treaty of Rome and the obligations of membership. We have contributed to the

Community&apos;s aim of ensuring the economic and social progress of its members

by common action to eliminate the barriers which divide Europe. We have

pursued the objective of improving the living and working conditions of her

people by action to promote economic growth and convergence among national

economies and by removing restrictions on trade. We have sought to strengthen

peace and liberty. The close of our Presidency marked the end of our transition

to full membership of the Community and the virtual completion of a customs

union covering what is in effect the largest single market in the world.

Annex 1

European Council

1. Regular meetings of the Heads of State and Government in the European

Council are a relatively new feature of the Community. At the beginning of this

year considerable attention was given by all member governments to ways in

which these meetings might make a still more effective contribution to the work

and progress of the Community. A need had become apparent to avoid exagger-

ated expectations on the one hand, and on the other a tendency to refer com-

paratively minor matters to the Council. At the same time it was considered

extremely important to maintain the informality and frankness through which

the leaders of the Member States are able to exchange views over a wide range

of subjects. Under our Presidency suitable arrangements were agreed and

accepted.

2. The first European Council during our Presidency was held in Rome on

25-26 March on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the signature of the

EEC Treaty which was marked with appropriate ceremonies. The dominant

theme of the meeting was the need to tackle the problems of inflation, growth

and employment, and the Council commissioned an important programme of

work in these fields. Their views were set out in a declaration which fore-

shadowed further discussions at their June meeting and a review of the results

achieved at their meeting at the end of 1977. The meeting also issued declarations

on trade relations with Japan, on the problems of the European steel industry

and on Community representation at the Downing Street Summit meeting for

those sessions at which items within the competence of the Community were

discussed. The Council also discussed the North/South Dialogue and agreed

that there should be commodity price stabilisation agreements where appropriate

and a Common Fund. The Prime Minister&apos;s statement on the outcome of the

European Council in Rome, together with the declarations issued, are set out in

full at the end of this Annex.

3. The second European Council during our Presidency was held in London

on 29-30 June. This meeting provided an opportunity to carry forward the

work undertaken in Rome on growth, inflation and employment, and a further

declaration was issued. Particular attention was paid to the problems of

unemployment of young people and the Social Affairs Council was asked to con-

sider common Community action in the light of work undertaken by the Com-

4


mission. The Council also issued a declaration on the Middle East; and provided

an opportunity for wide-ranging discussion of East-West problems and relations

with the developing countries. It was agreed that a decision on the site for the

Joint European Torus (JET) should be taken by the Foreign Affairs Council by

the end of July. The declarations issued, together with the Prime Minister&apos;s

statement on the outcome of the European Council in London, follow.

STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO

THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ON 28 MARCH 1977

EUROPEAN COUNCIL

(ROME MEETING)

I shall, with permission, make a statement on the European Council meeting

which took place in Rome on 25 and 26 March under my Chairmanship. Rome-

was chosen for this meeting to mark the twentieth anniversary of the signature

of the EEC Treaty.

The dominant theme of our talks was the need to find more effective ways to

tackle the serious economic problems which confront the world, to prepare for

the Downing Street summit in May, and to ensure that the Community itself

responds positively to the challenge of unemployment and inflation.

As is the custom for the President of the Council, I met first with leaders of

the European Trade Union Confederation. They expressed to me their concern

about the problems of inflation and unemployment, which I reported to the

Council. The Council agreed to hold a further tripartite conference in the first

half of this year to bring together European Governments, employers and trade

unions, and in the meantime agreed and published a statement on growth,

inflation and unemployment. The Council will review progress over this whole

area at its meeting in London in June.

The Council reviewed international financing problems and welcomed the

efforts of Finance Ministers to develop a Community position for the IMF

Interim Committee at the end of April. We asked the Commission and the

European Investment Bank to focus particular attention on measures in three

areas: first, to deal with specific employment problems, especially among youth

and women; second, to encourage higher levels of investment; and third, to

pull the economic performance of Member States closer together. The Commis-

sion made clear in Rome that it would be ready to respond with positive ideas.

An area in which all the Community countries face particularly acute diffi-

culties is the steel industry. We need short-term measures to stabilise the

market, and there is a clear requirement for structural reorganisation of the

industry throughout the Community. The Commission made a number of

proposals, which the European Council agreed should be given urgent attention,

with a view to getting agreement on common action.

Turning to international affairs, we agreed on the need for a successful

conclusion to the North/South Dialogue, and moved forward an important step

beyond the opening position on this subject previously agreed by Foreign

Ministers on 8 March. We agreed that there should be commodity price stabil-

isation agreements, where appropriate, and a Common Fund. There will also

be a study of export earnings stabilisation measures for developing countries

and special action for the CIEC on aid.

5


We reviewed developments in our trade relations with Japan, and saw a need

for further efforts to achieve the growth of trade on a balanced basis, which is

the Community&apos;s aim. Trade with Japan raises questions of competition and of

market access which are important factors in the Community&apos;s international

trade relations as a whole.

We discussed our internal Community affairs, including the question of

Community representation at the Downing Street summit. We agreed that the

President of the Council and the President of the Commission should represent

the Community at sessions which discuss questions which fall within the

competence of the Community. I shall circulate texts of the formal statements

in the Official Report.

Finally, i come to one point which has attracted considerable interest in this

House. The Commission confirmed that it would make a full study and report

on the idea of a European Foundation. There was general agreement with the

suggestion of the Belgian and Italian Prime Ministers that it would be appro-

priate to link this proposal with the twentieth anniversary of the Treaty which we

had celebrated in Rome.

DECLARATIONS ISSUED BY THE EUROPEAN

COUNCIL ON 25-26 MARCH 1977

Growth, Inflation and Employment

The European Council considered the prospects for economic development

within the Community and agreed that, in order to promote sustained economic

recovery and mitigate the severe unemployment being experienced in Member

countries, without risking the renewal of inflation, there is a need for intensified

co-operation at the Community as well as the international level.

The European Council recognised that such action must in large part be

undertaken on a world scale in which the Community has an important role

to play. In this connection they noted first that Community Finance Ministers

have reached a large measure of agreement on the views they will put forward

on international financing problems at the meeting of the IMF Interim Com-

mittee in Washington at the end of April, and secondly that ways of encouraging

a stronger, but still balanced, growth of world economic activity will be a major

theme of the London Summit in early May.

The European Council further agreed in particular to seek action at the

Community level in three directions: firstly to promote measures to help resolve

specific labour market problems, especially in improving training and employ-

ment opportunities for young people and women: secondly to encourage higher

levels of investment in the Member States: and thirdly to halt divergence and

promote convergence in their economic performance. To this end, the European

Council invited on the one hand the Commission, in particular by the better

use of Community instruments, and on the other hand the Board of Governors

of the European Investment Bank to seek ways of improving the effectiveness

of their activities.

The European Council emphasised the importance of co-operation between

the social partners in these matters and have agreed to the holding of a further

tripartite conference in the first half of this year, at a date to be agreed, at which

progress and possibilities could be reviewed. The European Council agreed to

reconsider progress on this range of problems at its own projected meeting in

June.

6


The European Council agreed to conduct at its meeting at the end of the year

an examination of the results obtained in the fields of growth, employment and

the fight against inflation and to assess the Community&apos;s prospects of making

progress towards Economic and Monetary Union.

Presidency Statement on the North/South Dialogue

We have agreed the basis of a common position.

We agreed that there should be commodity price stabilisation agreements

where appropriate and that there should be a Common Fund. There will also

be a study of export earnings stabilisation measures for developing countries

and of special action for the CIEC on aid.

This will now be worked up in detail at the Council on 5 April and will be

brought forward in the preparations for the CIEC Ministerial Meeting in Paris,

in which the Community will co-ordinate its position with the other industrialised

countries in the Group of Eight. This will be followed by detailed negotiations

at the UNCTAD Conference.

The Community will call on other countries, for instance in Eastern Europe

and oil producing countries, to make an adequate contribution in the develop-

ment field.

Community Participation in the Downing Street Summit

The President of the Council and the President of the Commission will be

invited to take part in those Sessions of the Downing Street Summit at which

items which are within the competence of the Community are discussed. Exam-

ples of such items are negotiations about international trade and the North/

South Dialogue.

Relations with Japan

The European Council, recalling its statement of 30 November 1976:

reaffirms the importance it attaches to maintaining good relations between

the Community and Japan;

notes that some progress has been made over the past four months towards

resolving certain specific trade problems;

observes however that not all the problems have yet been solved and considers

that efforts have to be continued particularly with a view to the sustained

expansion of Community exports to Japan;

invites accordingly the responsible Community Institutions to continue the

intensive discussions with the Japanese authorities with the aim of resolving

outstanding difficulties as rapidly as possible.

The Situation in the SteeFSector

The European Council has considered the situation in the steel sector, on the

basis of a communication from the Commission. This sector is experiencing a

depression more serious than at any time in the history of the Coal and Steel

Community. The Heads of State and Heads of Government have taken this

opportunity to reaffirm their resolve to restore to the steel industry through the

7


appropriate measures, the viability and competitiveness essential to the main-

tenance of a truly European industrial potential.

The European Council expresses its appreciation of the efforts being under-

taken by the Commission to put forward at an early date practical proposals

and initiatives for short-term remedial measures to stabilise the market, for a

longer-term structural reorganisation of the European steel industry and for

measures in the social field to assist workers adversely affected by such re-

organisation.

The European Council expresses the wish that the Council of Ministers gives

its urgent attention to the Commission&apos;s proposals and initiatives on these issues.

STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE

HOUSE OF COMMONS ON 30 JUNE 1977

European Council (London Meeting)

With permission, I should like to make a short statement on the meeting of

the European Council, which concluded at lunch-time today. Two statements

have been issued on growth, inflation and unemployment and on the Middle

East, and both have been placed in the Library of the House.

The European Council reviewed economic developments since our meeting in

Rome and recognised the need for a sustained expansion of world economic

activity consistent with a further reduction of the rate of inflation and of

unemployment.

Unemployment was a leading theme of our discussions, particularly employ-

ment of young people and of women, and I was able to report to the other Heads

of Government details of the youth opportunities programme which was

announced to the House yesterday by my right Hon. Friend the Secretary of

State for Employment. This initiative was very much welcomed.

Following the last European Council, I wrote to the Chairman of the Gover-

nors of the European Investment Bank asking for proposals from the Bank to

promote investment and employment. I reported to the Council that in reply

the Chairman has given a positive indication of an immediate expansion in the

Bank&apos;s activities which could lead to lending within the Community of about

 750 million in 1977 and  1 billion in 1978.

Members of the Council emphasised the importance of the commitments

made by some Heads of Government to the achievement of specific growth

targets in 1977 and emphasised the need to promote stability and to seek

expansion through export-led growth.

We invited the Commission to study certain sectors of industries in our

countries which are adversely affected by structural changes in the economy,

whilst adhering to the view that a liberal commercial policy was in the best

interests of the Community and of the world as a whole.

I was able to bring other Heads of Government up to date on the passage

of events in Southern Africa, including an account of the discussions at the

Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. It was agreed that the situation

is growing in seriousness and the Foreign Ministers will continue to exchange

views in order to achieve a concerted policy.

8


There was a useful exchange of views on East-West relations and President

Giscard reported on the recent visit to Paris of President Brezhnev.

The statement on the Middle East affirmed that all aspects of Security Council

Resolutions Nos 242 and 338 must be taken into account and our statement

reflects the leading role which the United States has in promoting negotiations

for a peace settlement. It was, nevertheless, the view of the Heads of Government

that a statement by the Nine at this stage would make clear our view of the need

for progress in further negotiations.

This was a useful but not dramatic meeting which enabled us to review

existing policies and, where necessary, to adapt them to a changing situation.

DECLARATIONS ISSUED BY THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL

ON 29-30 JUNE 1977

The Middle East

1. At the present critical stage in the Middle East, the Nine welcome all

efforts now being made to bring to an end the tragic conflict there. They empha-

sise the crucial interest which they see in early and successful negotiations

towards a just and lasting peace. They call on all the parties concerned to agree

urgently to participate in such negotiation in a constructive and realistic spirit:

at this juncture in particular all parties should refrain from statements of policies

which could constitute an obstacle to the pursuit of peace.

2. The Nine set out on many occasions in the past, for example, in their

statements of 6 November 1973, 28 September 1976 and 7 December 1976, their

view that a peace settlement should be based on Security Council Resolutions

242 and 338 and on: (i) the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force:

(ii) the need for Israel to end the territorial occupation which it has maintained

since the conflict in 1967: (iii) respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity

and independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace

within secure and recognised boundaries: (iv) recognition that in the establish-

ment of a just and lasting peace account must be taken of the legitimate rights

of the Palestinians. It remains their firm view that all these aspects must be

taken as a whole.

3. The Nine have affirmed their belief that a solution to the conflict in the

Middle East will be possible only if the legitimate right of the Palestinian people

to give effective expression to its national identity is translated into fact, which

would take into account the need for a homeland for the Palestinian people.

They consider that the representatives of the parties to the conflict, including the

Palestinian people, must participate in the negotiations in an appropriate

manner to be worked out in consultation between all the parties concerned. In

the context of an overall settlement, Israel must be ready to recognise the legiti-

mate rights of the Palestinian people: equally, the Arab side must be ready to

recognise the right of Israel to live in peace within secure and recognised

boundaries. It is not through the acquisition of territory by force that the security

of the States of the region can be assured: but it must be based on commitments

to peace exchanged between all the parties concerned with a view to establishing

truly peaceful relations.

9


4. The Nine believe that the peace negotiations must be resumed urgently,

with the aim of agreeing and implementing a comprehensive, just and lasting

settlement of the conflict. They remain ready to contribute to the extent the

parties wish in finding a settlement and in putting it into effect. They are also

ready to consider participating in guarantees in the framework of the United

Nations.

Economic Growth, Inflation and Employment

1. The European Council reviewed progress and on-going work on the range

of problems which it had identified at its March meeting in Rome, including both

action within the Community itself and co-operation at wider international levels.

2. At its March meeting the European Council agreed to seek action on

specific labour problems particularly for young people and women; to encourage

high levels of investment in Member States; and to halt divergence and promote

convergence in their economic performance. The European Council noted the

action taken within the Community on all these points.

3. The European Council welcomed the agreement reached on 28 June by

the Council (Social Affairs) to improve the effective operation of the European

Social Fund. It noted that the Commission would soon be submitting proposals

to use the fund for a scheme directed to the employment problems of women.

4. The European Council attaches particular importance to the problem of

structural unemployment among the young. It received a report from the Com-

mission on Community action in the field of the labour market and has called

on it to continue its work on the problem. The Council (Social Affairs) was asked

to meet in early autumn to consider, in the light of this work and of the results

of national measures, what common action might be necessary.

5. The European Council noted with satisfaction the spirit of co-operation

between governments, institutions and the social partners which marked the

work of the tripartite conference of 27 June. The Council hopes that the joint

study programme, announced at the end of the conference, may lead to a

strengthening of this spirit of co-operation.

6. The European Council noted the responses of the Commission and the

Board of Governors of the EIB to the invitation which it made to them on 26

March 1977 to suggest ways in which the Community might increase and

intensify its activities to promote convergence, investment and employment in

the Community.

7. The European Council invited the Board of Governors of the EIB to

implement its proposals.

8. The European Council also invited the Council (Ministers of Finance and

Economic Affairs) to examine as early as possible the Commission&apos;s com-

munication on investment and borrowing in the Community.

10


9. The European Council affirmed the necessity for the Member States to

arrive at a common energy policy.

10. The European Council reaffirmed the importance of co-operative efforts

by industrial countries to seek a sustained expansion of world economic activity,

consistent with further reduction of the rate of inflation and thereby to help

reduce unemployment. The European Council expressed its determination that

the Community and its Member States should play the appropriate part in this

world-wide co-operation. In this connection the European Council noted the

commitments made by some Heads of Government to the achievement of

specified growth targets in 1977 and to the review of policies and progress to this

end. It also noted that other Governments have expressed their intention of

continuing their stabilization policies. The European Council was concerned that

adequate international financing should be available to support this expansion

of world economic activity, and expressed the hope that the efforts being made

to this end in the IMF and elsewhere would be successful.

11. The European Council expressed its concern at the employment situation

in certain sectors adversely affected by structural changes in the economy. It

invited the Commission to continue studying all factors whether structural

or otherwise and to indicate the conclusions which it draws from these studies.

The European Council also concerned itself with the effects on the employment

situation of the open and liberal commercial policy of the Community to which

the Community, as the world&apos;s largest importer and exporter, remains strongly

attached.

Annex 2

Foreign Affairs Council

1. The Foreign Affairs Council in addition to its responsibilities for inter-

national issues exercises general oversight and co-ordination of Community

activities and deals with matters which are allocated to specialist Councils or

are referred to it by them on grounds of political importance. Foreign Affairs

Ministers also hold special meetings to prepare for meetings of the European

Council and to receive its remits for further work.

2. It was one of the main aims of our Presidency to improve the working

methods of the Council of Ministers and to give greater weight to political

priorities in the ordering of its work. With the help of the Council secretariat

significant progress was made in this direction. Meetings were shorter and better

prepared and on 21 June the Council carried out a successful experiment in

simplifying its procedures and concentrating on subjects requiring political

leadership by Ministers.

External Affairs

UNCTAD

3. At its sessions in January, February and March the Council prepared

and reached agreement on a common Community position for the Common

11


Fund negotiating conference which was held in Geneva from 7 March to 3 April.

The Community&apos;s contribution at the conference was a positive one. This was

emphasised by the decision taken by the European Council on 25-26 March

that there should be commodity price stabilisation agreements where appropriate

and a Common Fund.

CIEC

4. The Conference on International Economic Co-operation (CIEC) resumed

its work suspended in December 1976 in April 1977 and concluded at a

Ministerial meeting from 30 May to 2 June. From mid-January, a detailed

programme of work was undertaken in Brussels to prepare common Community

positions on all the major issues. The CIEC figured on the agenda of every

Council until the conclusion of the Conference. Close contact was maintained

throughout this process between the Community&apos;s representatives (Presidency

and Commission) and those of the United States, Japan, Canada and other

industrialised countries participating in the CIEC. When the Conference

resumed in April, the Community was able to give a constructive lead on a

number of key issues and by common consent made an important contribution

to the work of the Conference. Although the Conference failed to reach complete

agreement on all issues, significant progress was made on many of the subjects

under discussion, including agreement on some 20 detailed subjects and on the

Community proposal for the provision by the participating developed countries

of a special action programme of $1 billion to help meet immediate needs of

individual low income countries. In particular there was agreement in line with

the Community&apos;s ideas to the establishment of a Common Fund with purposes,

objectives and other constituent elements to be further negotiated in UNCTAD.

In the Conference&apos;s Final Report the 27 participants concluded that the CIEC

had contributed to a broader understanding of the international economic

situation; that its intensive discussions had been useful; and that the dialogue

between developed and developing countries should be pursued actively in the

United Nations system and other existing appropriate bodies.

Lome Convention

5. At its meeting on 5 April the Council prepared the Community&apos;s position

for the second meeting of the ACP/EEC Joint Council of Ministers held at Suva,

Fiji on 13-14 April, at which the British Presidency represented the Community.

A number of positive decisions on outstanding ACP requests were taken and the

Joint Council was generally accounted a success by both sides. In addition the

second session of the ACP/EEC Consultative Assembly was held at Luxembourg

from 7-9 June, bringing together parliamentarians and representatives of the

EEC and ACP states for 2 days of constructive and wide-ranging debate.

GATT MTNs

6. The Community continues to play an important and constructive role in

the GATT MTNs which are now moving into a more active stage. The conference

of Heads of State and Governments held in London on 7-8 May 1977 reaffirmed

that the current round of GATT Trade Negotiations should be pursued

vigorously, and that every effort should be made this year to achieve substantive

progress in such key areas as tariff reductions, non-tariff barriers and a mutually

acceptable approach to agriculture.

12


Enlargement

7. The enlargement of the Community was under active consideration as

an issue which would decisively condition its internal and external development

in the years ahead. The political benefits of strengthening European democracy

were discussed as well as the practical problems that will be involved in any

further possible enlargement of the Community from 9 to 12. This was the central

theme of the informal meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Nine at Leeds

Castle on 21-22 May.

Greece

8. Negotiations on Greece&apos;s application for membership of the Community

made satisfactory progress, with monthly meetings at ambassadorial level.

There was also a meeting at ministerial level on 5 April at which the British

President of the Council stated that, although the Community would need to

consider the implications of other applications for membership, negotiations

with Greece would continue to be treated on their intrinsic merits. These ex-

changes set out the positions of both sides on most of the main sectors with the

aim of providing an overall view of the problems to be solved in the next stage

of the negotiations. At its meeting on 21 June, the Council reviewed a number of

questions related to the interests of Mediterranean producers which are of

importance for the Community&apos;s relations with other Mediterranean countries

and for enlargement generally. This cleared the way for the next stage of discus-

sion of agricultural questions in the negotiations with Greece. A second EEC/

Greece Financial Protocol was signed on 28 February.

Portugal

9. The Council meetings in February and March prepared the ground for

the expected Portuguese application for full membership of the European

Communities which was submitted on 28 March. The Council on 5 April

acknowledged receipt of this application and asked the Commission to begin

work, in consultation with the other Member States and with Portugal on the

Opinion required under Article 237 of the Treaty of Rome.

Turkey

10. Following a successful meeting of the EEC/Turkey Association Council

on 20 December 1976, a number of outstanding points in the relationship

between Turkey and the Community, notably the Agricultural Review and

Free Movement for Turkish migrant workers, were subsequently resolved. In

addition a third EEC/Turkey Financial Protocol, granting Turkey 310 million

units of account (mua) in special loans and loans from the European Investment

Bank, was signed in London on 16 May.

Mediterranean

11. The Community policy, known as the &quot;overall approach&quot; to the Mediter-

ranean countries made great progress during this period. New co-operation

agreements with Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria (the Mashraq) were signed

on behalf of the Community by the President of the Council and their trade

provisions were brought into effect on 1 July. At the Council on 8 February two

additional protocols to the EEC/Israel Agreement were similarly signed. The

Protocols cover financial, economic and industrial co-operation.

13


12. The Council discussed and agreed the Community position for negotia-

tions with Spain aimed at adapting the existing EEC/Spain Agreement to the

enlarged Community of Nine. Agreement was also reached on mandates for the

negotiations with Cyprus and Malta to extend the existing agreements with

those countries beyond their expiry date on 30 June 1977. On 8 March the Council

reiterated the importance it attached to the development of good relations with

Yugoslavia and welcomed the meeting of the EEC/Yugoslavia Joint Committee

on 29 March.

EFTA

13. The British Presidency marked the end of the period of transition

towards free trade between the Community and EFTA. On 13 May the EFTA

Summit Meeting in Vienna called for the further development of relations with

the Community. The Community&apos;s response, which welcomed the EFTA

initiative, was set out in a Presidency reply on 21 June.

State trading countries

14. On 18 April, the British Ambassador in Warsaw received the formal

CMEA reply to the Community&apos;s communication of 17 November 1976. The

Council on 21 June approved the text of a reply to the CMEA. It is hoped that

these exchanges will lead soon to formal negotiations between the two organisa-

tions.

Iran

15. Agreement was reached on the Community&apos;s mandate for the negotia-

tions for a framework agreement on commercial and economic co-operation

between the Community and Iran and negotiations opened on 20 December

1976. The second round of these negotiations took place in Brussels on 19 April.

It is expected that further rounds will take place later this year.

Japan

16. The Community continued to attach importance to the need to resolve

current trading problems with Japan in a spirit of co-operation. To this end the

Council has kept under review relations between the Community and Japan.

The Commission on behalf of Member States has been engaged in a series of

discussions with the Japanese about trade problems. These were reviewed by

the European Council on 26 March. Following that meeting Vice-President

Haferkamp carried discussions further with Japanese Ministers at high level

consultations in Tokyo on 17-19 May.

Shipbuilding

17. The continuing world shipbuilding crisis required close co-operation

between Member States during our Presidency. The Community adopted a

common approach in the international discussions in the OECD, where the

British Presidency acted as spokesman and where concessions on pricing policies

were secured in negotiations with the Japanese Government. The Community is

pressing for an equitable distribution of new orders between major shipbuilding

countries and an international solution to the longer term problem of over-

capacity.

14


Steel

18. The Commission introduced a number of measures designed to restore

stability to the Community steel market which is still in recession. These

included guidance on minimum prices and deliveries of selected steel produced

within the Common Market, mandatory minimum prices for reinforcing bars,

surveillance licensing of imports of a number of steel products and recom-

mendations on safeguard procedures against disruptive imports. These measures

were the subject of consultation with Member States, in the course of which

the need to safeguard production and employment levels was recognised.

Textiles

19. On a number of occasions the Council discussed the Community&apos;s

position in the negotiations for the renewal of the GATT Multi-Fibre Arrange-

ment (MFA) which expires at the end of 1977. The Council agreed that the

Community&apos;s objective should be to secure substantial changes in the way the

MFA operates, including in particular more realistic quota growth rates and

arrangements to stabilise import penetration levels for the most sensitive pro-

ducts by setting overall limits to low cost imports.

20. During this period the Community also negotiated a further bilateral

restraint agreement with Thailand under the current MFA. Negotiations with

Hungary and Poland are in prospect.

Uganda

21. At its meeting on 21 June the Council considered the Community&apos;s

relations with Uganda in the light of the violations of human rights occurring

there. The Council agreed to issue the following statement 

&quot;The Council deplores the consistent denial of basic human rights to the

people of Uganda.

The Council agrees to take steps within the framework of its relationship

with Uganda under the Lome Convention to ensure that any assistance given

by the Community to Uganda does not in any way have as its effect a rein-

forcement or prolongation of the denial of basic human rights to its people.&quot;

Nuclear issues

22. The Council considered problems that had arisen in negotiations with

Canada about the supply of Canadian nuclear materials. At its meeting on 21

June the Council also considered a range of interlinked problems of nuclear

policy. Agreement was reached that there should be further study of the question

of Community participation in the International Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation

programme. It was also agreed that discussions should be continued on safe-

guards with the International Atomic Energy Authority.

The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)

23. The Community has been considering alternative ways of strengthening

the dialogue with the five members of ASEAN (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philip-

pines, Singapore and Thailand), which has been conducted since 1975 by the

Commission through the Joint Study Group. The Council decided on 21 June

15


to pursue with ASEAN the establishment of a dialogue within the framework

of the Council which would permit exchanges of views on a wide range of

subjects of mutual interest.

Latin America

24. The United Kingdom Presidency carried forward discussions of ways

in which the dialogue with the Latin American countries could be improved.

Fisheries

25. Fishery problems were considered both by the Foreign Affairs Council

and by specialist Councils, and on several occasions United Kingdom Fisheries

Ministers attended Foreign Affairs Councils. In general the Foreign Ministers

concentrated on external aspects of Community policy. With the extension of

fishery limits to 200 miles at the beginning of January 1977 the Community

assumed responsibility for negotiating fishing arrangements with third countries.

Framework agreements were concluded with Sweden, the Faroes and the United

States and negotiations were carried to an advanced stage with a number of

other countries including Norway, Spain, the Soviet Union, Poland and the

German Democratic Republic. Quotas involving sharp reductions in third

country fishing were imposed by the Community initially for three months but

were later extended during negotiations. It was agreed with Norway and the

Faroes that fishing should continue at existing levels, but this arrangement was

modified on both sides by conservation measures. The fishing of most third

countries was made subject to control by licensing. With the expiry of the agree-

ment reached in Oslo on 1 June 1976 British fishing at Iceland ended on 30

November. Following a joint visit by Mr Frank Judd (on behalf of the Council),

and Commissioner Gundelach to Reykjavik in early June it was agreed that

negotiations would be resumed in the autumn.

Staff Matters

26. Work on the general review of the Community&apos;s Staff Regulations

continued under our Presidency. When disputes arise the Presidency has certain

special responsibilities for dialogue with staff representatives and Dr Owen held

two meetings for this purpose. One was on 8 March, when the Council adopted

a new Regulation on stand-by duty for certain categories of staff. On the second

occasion, at the Council on 21 June, a dispute with the staff over compensation

for cost-of-living increases was resolved after the Presidency had used its

discretion to appoint a mediator. The United Kingdom accepted this settlement

on the understanding that Community staff salaries would be adjusted as neces-

sary in the autumn pay review to take account of comparable real wage move-

ments in Member States.

Uniform Passport

27. Following discussion in the Council in December 1976, consideration

was given to the design of the proposed uniform style of national passport.

Some differences remain on the layout of the cover and the inside pages as well

as on the languages to be used. Parliament has been kept informed of develop-

ments and the Government have undertaken to arrange a debate before any

final decisions are taken.

16


Rights of Establishment

28. The Council adopted on 22 March a directive for implementation

within two years, enabling lawyers established in one Member State to provide,

on a temporary basis, services, such as legal advice or advocacy, in the rest of

the Community. The Council adopted on 27 June two directives also to be

implemented within two years, which enable general nurses to practice and pro-

vide services throughout the Community. Proposals concerning midwives,

dentists and architects are still under consideration.

Annex 3

Agricultural Council

1. The major task of the Agricultural Council was the fixing of agricultural

support prices for 1977/78. The Commission&apos;s proposals were debated in both

Houses of Parliament and after the traditional lengthy negotiations the Council

agreed on a general price increase of 3.5 per cent in unit of account terms to-

gether with a series of adjustments in national &quot;green&quot; exchange rates which had

the effect of reducing discrepancies between Member States with appreciating

currencies and those with depreciating currencies. This was the first price fixing

in which formal consultation took place between the Presidency and representa-

tives of consumers as well as producers. The increase in common support prices

was the lowest in recent years and its effect was to reduce in real terms the level

of support to most Community producers and so to discourage the production of

surpluses. The resulting average increase in food prices in the United Kingdom

was estimated at one-third of one per cent in the period to April 1978.

2. Apart from the price decisions several other measures were adopted to

improve the balance between supply and demand for dairy products in the

Community. These included the introduction of a new Community-financed

butter subsidy in the United Kingdom, incentives to dairy farmers to give up

milk production, a subsidy for milk supplies to schools, an accelerated pro-

gramme for the eradication of certain diseases of cattle, and a levy on milk

production which will help to restrain over-production and provide funds for

promoting consumption.

3. During our Presidency improvements were made in a number of com-

modity regimes. Final agreement was reached on a more flexible system of

support for breadmaking wheat. The beef premium scheme was continued for

a further year and the previous severe restrictions on imports were replaced

by a more flexible system of levies. Important changes were agreed in the market-

ing arrangements for hops designed to stabilise the market and strengthen

producer groups.

4. Negotiations on access for sugar from ACP countries, India and the over-

seas countries and territories in 1977/78 were satisfactorily concluded. The

Council also agreed that in the event of continuing surplus production the maxi-

mum sugar quota for Commodity producers would be reduced from the 1978/79

marketing year.

17


5. The Council agreed on measures of support for programmes of investment

in the processing and marketing of agricultural products. These will in due course

replace the existing aid for individual projects. Considerable progress was also

made in the discussion of measures to encourage producer groups.

6. On the initiative of our Presidency progress was made towards a revision

of the food standards programme designed to concentrate attention on general

measures affecting all foodstuffs (&quot;horizontal&quot;) where potential trade benefits

can be expected, and to avoid expending effort over too wide a range of

&quot;vertical&quot; directives affecting only particular foodstuffs. Agreement was also

reached on food standards for coffee.

7. Following the Council&apos;s agreement in December on further health controls

on intra-Community trade in live animals, meat and meat products, work con-

tinued on other animal disease problems and on meat hygiene. Agreement was

reached on the application to intra-Community trade in livestock of the welfare

provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Animals

during International Transport. The Council also agreed in principle to

eliminate barriers to trade in pure bred breeding cattle between Member States.

Annex 4

Budget Council

The Community Budget

1. In accordance with the decision of the European Council in December

1975, a Joint Meeting of Foreign and Finance Ministers was held for the second

time on 5 April 1977. The Council made a general survey of budgetary problems

within the context of the Community&apos;s general policies and considered priorities

for expenditure. Ministers broadly agreed with proposals put before them by

the Commission. These emphasised the need for measures which would combat

unemployment, especially of young people, promote convergence in the econo-

mies of Member States, and achieve greater co-ordination in the application of

structural intervention funds. There was also general agreement with the Com-

mission&apos;s views on the desirability of containing expenditure on agriculture and

of reducing the Community&apos;s dependence on imported energy.

2. The preliminary draft budget for 1978 was presented by the Commission

to the Council on 15 June 1977 and will be considered by the Budget Council

on 20 July when it has been agreed as a draft. In accordance with the provisions

of the Treaty, there will be a process of consultation between the Council and

the Assembly before the budget is finally adopted by the latter at the end of the

year.

3. During our Presidency the Council&apos;s Budget Committee undertook

extensive work on Commission proposals for the complete revision of the

Financial Regulation applicable to the Budget, for the introduction of a new

European Unit of Account, and for a Regulation to implement the introduction

of VAT-related own resources from I January 1978.

18


4. The amending Treaty of July 1975 setting up the European Court of

Auditors entered into force on 1 June 1977. The Government welcome this

development and believe that the Court, working in association with the

Control Sub-Committee of the Budgets Committee of the Assembly, will make

a valuable contribution to control over expenditure by the Community.

Anni:x 5

Development Council

1. The Development Council met on 22 March and again on 16 June. The

main item before the Council was a proposal from the Commission for a

continuing programme of Community aid to developing countries not associated

formally with the Community. No final decision was taken on this proposal

but the Council succeeded in reaching agreement in principle to the release of the

45 million units of account for the non-associated countries included in the 1977

Budget, and on the general way it should be spent, for instance by distribution

to Asia and Latin America in the ratio of 3:1.

2. The Council also made useful progress on food aid, by agreeing its general

aim and the criteria for selecting the recipient countries and determining quanti-

ties. They also made further advances in the co-ordination and harmonisation

of development aid policies. In particular they agreed to strengthen through

increased co-ordination and, in suitable cases, pooling of efforts, the efficiency

of the Community&apos;s response to natural disasters and comparable emergencies.

3. As a new departure, the Council agreed to hold once or twice a year a

general informal discussion on fundamental problems in the field of relations

with the developing countries; and at the June meeting they held the first such

discussion on questions of rural development, agriculture and food production

in the developing world.

Annex 6

Energy Council

1. Shortly before our Presidency the Energy Council met on 21 December

1976 when they agreed to practical arrangements for Governments to license

intra-Community oil trade during any future emergency and adopted a work

programme. On assuming the Presidency Mr Benn undertook a programme of

informal discussions with each of his Ministerial colleagues in the Community

and with the Commissioner for Energy. At its meeting on 29 March the Council

reached agreement on the extension of aid to coking coal and on the Euratom

loans scheme, and there was agreement in principle to surveillance of coal

imports from non-Member countries. It was also agreed that the Commission

should develop proposals, including those relating to a minimum safeguard

price for oil, to promote and protect Community energy investments. The Council

also had a preliminary discussion of refining problems in the Community: and

held an exchange of views on political aspects of the Community&apos;s energy

situation, during which they reaffirmed their will to help improve the balance of

the world energy market by means of a Community energy policy, by a deter-

19


mined effort to economise on energy and to develop both traditional and new

indigenous sources of energy. They gave political impetus to further special

discussions on energy conservation to be undertaken in the Community.

2. At its meeting on 14 June the Council took stock of progress in their work

programme, and had a substantial general discussion of nuclear problems. This

concentrated particularly on uranium supply and demand, on nuclear fuel

reprocessing and waste management and on the environment and safety (on

which some preference was expressed for general guidelines rather than a

safety code as recommended by the report of the European Coal and Steel

Community (ECSC.)

There was also discussion of further study to help promote the develop-

ment of nuclear energy under conditions acceptable to the public. The Council

also had an initial exchange of views on a proposal to aid financing of coal

stocks, and discussed a proposal to promote the use of coal for electricity

generation, the refining problems in the Community, measures relating to oil

consumption in any future oil emergency, the development and protection of

energy investments, support for the exploitation of alternative energy sources,

and a number of new measures to promote the rational use of energy. Considera-

tion of all these matters is continuing.

3. A fuller factual account of these discussions and of steps taken by the

British Presidency to foster a realistic Community energy policy has been

published separately by the Department of Energy in a booklet entitled &quot;A

record of the UK Presidency of the Energy Council January-June 1977&quot;.

Annex 7

Environment Council

1. Consideration was given to a wide range of proposals arising from the

Community&apos;s Environment Programme. These ranged from measures aimed at

establishing standards for water quality for various purposes including human

consumption and the preservation of freshwater fish, through criteria for estab-

lishing air quality standards for protection against atmospheric pollution in

various forms, to measures for ensuring the protection of all species of wild birds

throughout the Community.

2. The Council at its meeting on 14 June substantially endorsed a Directive

establishing a common approach to the disposal of toxic and dangerous wastes

as well as measures for the exchange of information on the quality of surface

freshwater throughout the Community. These measures should soon be ready for

adoption. Discussion also took place on a draft directive on quality standards

for drinking water, but the Presidency was unsuccessful in its efforts to reconcile

differences of approach on the part of other Member States. The Council also

discussed the control of wastes from the titanium dioxide and paper pulp

industries. There was disagreement over alternative methods of control by

reference to quality objectives and by reference to uniform emission standards.

These differences remain to be resolved, but some progress was made. Agree-

ment was reached on the principle of accession by the Community, as well as

the Member States directly concerned, to the Helsinki Convention on the pre-

vention of pollution in the Baltic.

Annex 8

Finance and Economic Council

Economic and Monetary Co-operation

1. The Council at their meeting in February agreed to a programme of

Community work and discussion, and co-operation in wider international

discussion, on economic and monetary co-operation. Much background work

was commissioned and carried out by the Monetary Committee, the Committee

of Central Bank Governors, the Economic Policy Committee and the Standing

Committee on Employment; this work and the Council discussions of it

followed three main lines.

2. First, the continuing disequilibrium in the international balance of pay-

ments was recognised as calling for additional official international financing

under the International Monetary Fund. Recommendations agreed at the April

Council were presented by Mr Healey to the Interim Committee of the Inter-

national Monetary Fund at the end of the month, were broadly supported by

other members of that Committee, and will, it is hoped, lead to the establishment

of substantial supplementary financing arrangements and an enlargement of

IMF quotas in the review which is currently taking place.

3. Secondly, the Council recognised that the major determinant of future

levels of employment in member countries would be the level of world economic

activity and the contribution to it made in particular by major countries enjoying

relatively strong balance of payments positions. There was general recognition

of the important contribution which the United States, Japan and Germany

could make, and the general thinking developed in the Council was matched in

the adoption of targets for economic growth by those major countries at the

Downing Street Summit in May.

4. Thirdly, there was considerable study and exchange of views on the role

of special investment and employment measures and on the relationships of

trades unions, employers and governments in stimulating activity whilst

restraining inflation. An important focus for this work was provided by the

Tripartite Conference held at the end of June. The Conference achieved a valu-

able development of joint understanding as described in Annex 12. The problems

are formidable and by no means solved yet; this work will be continued under

the Belgian Presidency during the second half of this year.

Insurance

5. The Council on 14 March agreed that work should be speeded up on the

directives covering the sale of non-life insurance on a services basis and life

insurance on an established basis and that the working parties should aim sub-

stantially to complete their work within 12 months. Work has also continued

on other directives on insurance.

Export Credits

6. Also on 14 March, the Council decided that the Community would apply

certain guidelines governing the extension of officially supported export credits

21


to third countries. Several Member States including the United Kingdom and

many other members of the OECD were already conforming to these guidelines

which are intended to avoid destructive competition between credit-supplying

countries. The guidelines were applied on an experimental basis until 30 June

1977, but on 16 June the Council decide to extend their application until the end

of the year.

7. In addition the Council undertook a wide range of Community business,

including:

the adoption of a fourth medium-term economic policy programme and

instructions for a further review;

 further examination of suggestions made by the Netherlands Minister of

Finance on the management of Community exchange rates;

 discussion of a directive aimed at harmonising conditions of banking in

member countries;

 discussion of a directive for a second stage in the harmonisation of the struc-

ture of excise duty on cigarettes, resulting in agreement to include VAT in

the tax base for the purpose of calculating the specific component in the duty

and providing an opportunity for the United Kingdom to propose that

Member States should be free to impose a supplementary duty on cigarettes

with a high yield of noxious substances;

 agreement on further Joint Community Borrowing of $500 million for on-

lending as balance of payments support to Italy.

Annex 9

Fiscal Council

Value Added Tax

1. An important success during the British Presidency was the adoption by

the Council of the Sixth Directive on Value Added Tax on 17 May 1977. This

major piece of Community legislation had been under intensive discussion in

the Council framework since its publication in 1973. The Directive is to har-

monise the basis of assessment and administration of the tax in Member States,

including the scope of exemptions, but not the rates. The Directive does not

entail any major changes in the structure of VAT in the UK; in particular the

main existing exemptions and zero-ratings are safeguarded. It comes into effect

on 1 January 1978, but there are provisions for a transitional period in certain

specified matters.

2. The adoption of this Directive provides a basis for implementing the

Council Decision on &quot;own resources&quot; of 21 April 1970. Under this Decision the

Community Budget is to be financed, in addition to the yield of customs duties

and agricultural levies, by the revenue obtained by applying a rate not exceeding

1 per cent to a harmonised VAT base. Discussions on the detailed measures

necessary to calculate and collect the VAT &quot;own resources&quot; have begun.

3. Agreement on such an important measure as the Sixth Directive could be

achieved only after intensive negotiation. A number of important issues were

decided during the previous Presidency; but agreement on the package as a

whole, and in particular adherence to the agreed timetable, was an achievement

of our Presidency.

22


Anni-:x 10

Fisheries Council

1. Fisheries were discussed not only in the Foreign Affairs Council (Annex 2,

paragraph 24), but also in the Agriculture Council and a Fisheries Council on

27 June, where Ministers concentrated on internal aspects of Community policy.

2. Member States having previously agreed to extend their fisheries limits to

200 miles at the beginning of 1977, the Commission produced in December 1976

proposals for the management during 1977 of the fisheries resources within these

extended limits. The proposals, which included provision for catch quotas, were

interim in character so as to allow time for the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP)

to be revised. Agreement on them was not possible but Member States agreed to

a standstill arrangement under which they would restrict their current catches

to the levels of 1976 and observe existing North East Atlantic Fisheries Commis-

sion conservation measures.

3. Other urgently required conservation measures were introduced on a

Community basis in February. They included the seasonal closure for Norway

pout fishing of an area off the North and East coasts of Scotland and a ban on

directed herring fishing in the North Sea until 30 April, subsequently extended

to 30 June. In default of agreement on Community measures for the North Sea

herring stock after 30 June, the United Kingdom sought the concurrence of the

Commission in national measures applying a ban in waters within British

fishery limits. A Community ban on herring fishing off the West Coast of Scot-

land was agreed for the month of June and subsequently extended until 20 July.

Subject to the lifting of an Irish reserve by that date, quota arrangements will be

introduced for the West of Scotland herring stock. It was not possible to secure

Community agreement to controls on fishing around Ireland and the Irish

Government announced a national ban on fishing by boats exceeding a

specified length or horse power. The legality of these measures was challenged

by the Commission before the European Court of Justice which had not given

its judgment by the end of our Presidency.

4. A general revision of the CFP is necessary to meet the new situation

resulting from 200 mile fishing limits, and at the end of June the United Kingdom

Government sought to indicate further the lines along which an acceptable

settlement might be pursued.

Annex 11

Research Council

1. Throughout the British Presidency the Research Council has been

concerned with two difficult and important problems the Commission&apos;s pro-

posals for the construction of the Joint European Torus (JET) and the 1977-80

programme for the Joint Research Centre (JRC).

2. Under our Presidency efforts were made to identify the obstacles to agree-

ment and to prepare the ground for a further Council meeting. Consultations

were held with the previous President of the Research Council, Professor

Brinkhorst, and with the Commissioner responsible, Dr Brunner. The Presidency

23


also conducted discussions about the management arrangements for JET with

the Commission and with each of the Member States either in Paris on 14

February or in Brussels on 21 March.

3. The Research Council on 29 March was presided over by Mr Kaufman.

The United Kingdom was represented by Mr Benn. Discussion of the JRC

programme was carried forward. As to JET, after the preparations which had

been undertaken, two sites appeared to emerge as the leading contenders for the

project; Culham in the UK and Garching in Germany. It was not possible to

bring matters to a final conclusion, owing in part to important differences of view

on the management structure for the project. Although the Presidency pursued

its attempts to break the resulting deadlock, it had to be accepted that final

decisions could not be taken without further work.

4. Accordingly, our Presidency continued its efforts in the Committee of

Permanent Representatives to narrow the differences between the Member

States. Good progress was made, and the obstacles which remained were more

narrowly defined. At the European Council it was agreed that the question of the

site for JET should be dealt with by the Foreign Affairs Council in July.

5. Throughout these consultations the United Kingdom consistently

emphasised its view that JET should be sited at Culham. This view is based on

Culham&apos;s outstanding technical qualifications and the fact that the JET design

team is already assembled there; and on the consideration that there is at present

no Community institution in the United Kingdom.

Annex 12

Social Affairs Council

1. The aim of our Presidency in the field of social affairs was to help forward

a balanced programme of measures for consideration by the Social Affairs

Council. The main feature of the programme was the review of the European

Social Fund.

2. The Council met under the chairmanship of Mr John Morris on 28 June.

They gave approval to a Directive to facilitate the freedom of movement of

workers within the Community by providing for the specific educational needs

of their children. This provides that, in accordance with national circumstances

and legal systems, appropriate measures will be taken within 4 to 5 years to

provide introductory tuition in the language of the host country and to promote

the teaching of the mother tongue and culture.

3. The Council also approved a Directive on the harmonisation of safety

information at work, proposals for which were originally made in the Social

Action Programme. The Directive, which will not apply to the coal mining

industry, provides for the implementation by Member States of a uniform

system of safety signs by 1 January 1981.

4. The Commission&apos;s proposals for the review of the tasks and operations

of the European Social Fund, which provides financial support for schemes of

training, retraining and resettlement to help the unemployed and under-

employed, were communicated to the Council on 24 March 1977; they were

24


debated by the House of Commons on 13 June. After intensive discussion in the

Community the British Presidency was able to lead the Council to reach agree-

ment in principle on a settlement.

5. The Council received a statement from Commissioner Vredeling on the

future of social policy in the Community and will return to the subject at a

future meeting. They took note of a Commission report on the progress made in

setting up a European Trade Union Institute, confirmed their interest in the

project and indicated their intention to decide as quickly as possible on the

relationship between the Community and the Institute after closely examining

the technical and other aspects involved.

6. The Council also took note of a report on the progress of certain Com-

mission proposals on the conflict of laws in employment relationships, on equal

treatment for men and women in social security, and on the harmonisation of

a ws to combat illegal immigration and illegal employment.

The Tripartite Conference

Unemployment

7. A Conference on the theme of &quot;Growth, Stability and Employment:

Stocktaking and Prospects&quot; attended by Finance and Social Affairs Ministers,

by representatives of the employers and trades unions organisations at European

level, and representatives of the European Assembly and the Economic and Social

Committee, took place in Luxembourg on 27 June. The Conference did not

attempt to reach formal agreements but sought to exchange ideas and experiences

on the underlying causes of the present situation with a view to distinguishing

areas of common understanding, to review possible approaches to the solution

of the problem, and to identify further action which might usefully be undertaken.

Some important points of agreement were reached on the underlying causes of

the present economic situation, and on possible approaches to solutions both

at international and national levels. There was general agreement on the need to

strengthen consensus between governments and social partners, to take further

action to promote economic growth, wherever possible, without rekindling

inflation and to stimulate higher levels of investment as well as the development

of specific labour market policies. The role of fiscal and monetary policy was also

discussed. The Conference adopted a programme of studies.

Other Activities in the Social Affairs Field

8. On 5 May the Standing Committee on Employment met under the

Chairmanship of Mr Booth. The Committee discussed employment prospects

in the Community until 1980 and the review of the Social Fund. They also

received a statement from Commissioner Giolitti on the co-ordination of

Community financial instruments.

9. Discussions have continued on Commission proposals designed to elimi-

nate barriers to trade and at the same time achieve standards acceptable from

the point of view of health and safety.

10. In the field of education two schemes of grants were announced for the

academic year 1977-78, to support short study visits by teaching and adminis-

25


trative staff in higher education, and to promote the development of joint study

courses in higher education. Progress was made in formulating specific plans on

the preparation of young people for work.

Annex 13

Transport Council

1. The Council on 16 December adopted a Directive requiring Member

States to operate a system of compulsory roadworthiness tests for public service

vehicles, freed from quota restrictions the carriage of live animals in special

vehicles and approved a letter to the Group of Nine Railway Companies of the

Community inviting them to continue and to increase their co-operation.

Subsequently the Commission granted the United Kingdom a further 10 months&apos;

derogation from 1 March 1977 of the requirement to apply to vehicles on

internal United Kingdom journeys the EEC Social Regulation (543/69) on

drivers&apos; hours and conditions of work.

2. During the British Presidency, a major initiative was mounted to complete

a Community regime for the whole vehicle type approval of passenger cars; this

was warmly welcomed by Community manufacturers. The Council on 28-29

June adopted a resolution which took note of the substantial progress which had

been achieved and instructed the Committee of Permanent Representatives to

press on with the completion of the relatively small number of outstanding

technical Directives and also to intensify their study of the full implications of

implementing the system, including in particular the commercial and industrial

aspects. It also asked the Commission to convene an early meeting of representa-

tives of the Member States and the Community motor vehicle industries to

examine how the system might best be operated in practice.

3. The Council provisionally agreed a number of amendments to the Social

Regulation including a limited number of national exemptions for certain classes

of vehicles, abolition of the rule requiring double-manning on journeys of over

450 km for the heavier articulated vehicles, the special provision to be applied

where the driver and his vehicle were carried by ferry boats and trains and the

prohibition of certain types of bonus payment. But the Council were unable to

agree to the staged introduction of the Regulation for domestic traffic in the

United Kingdom and Ireland. This problem will need to be discussed again

before agreement can be reached on amendments of the Regulation as a whole.

4. A Presidency paper on the future development of the Common Trans-

port Policy was welcomed by the Council as the first stage in a thorough re-

appraisal of the aims and objectives of the Policy. The Council agreed that a

revised work programme, including a list of priorities for action in the different

fields of the Common Transport Policy should be prepared by the Commission.

5. The Council reached final agreement on establishing a consultation

procedure within the Community on shipping matters and also agreed that the

formal discussions of civil aviation matters should begin under the aegis of the

Council.

26


Annex 14

Political Co-operation

1. The Nine Member States of the Community have continued to consult

closely and to co-ordinate their positions on foreign policy matters. During the

British Presidency London has been the centre for the many Political Co-

operation meetings held at all levels.

2. Foreign Ministers met twice in Political Cooperation, on 31 January and

again on 18 April. The Political Committee, consisting of the Political Directors

of the Foreign Ministries of the Nine, met 8 times during the Presidency to

prepare the work of Ministers. Their work in turn was prepared by 15 working

groups covering all the major geographical areas of the world as well as certain

other substantive matters which feature regularly on Political Cooperation

agendas. The working groups alone accounted for more than 60 meeting days

during the past 6 months. In addition London has been the centre of the busy

telegraphic network linking directly the Foreign Ministries of the Nine Member

States.

3. A major task has been the need to prepare a comprehensive approach to

the Belgrade meetings called to review implementation of the Helsinki Final

Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The preparations

were reviewed by Ministers at both their meetings in Political Cooperation.

4. Foreign Ministers have also devoted a good deal of time and effort to

African questions. On 31 January they issued a statement on Rhodesia in

support of the British Government&apos;s position which appealed for a negotiated

settlement to bring about a rapid and orderly transfer of power to the majority

in Zimbabwe and formally declared that the Smith regime could not expect any

assistance from the Nine. On 18 April Foreign Ministers issued a general

declaration on Africa. This expressed concern about the growth of violence and

evidence of instability and economic disruption; declared support for the right

of the Namibian and Rhodesian peoples to self-determination and independence;

repeated their condemnation of apartheid in South Africa; underwrote efforts by

the Organisation of African Unity and Nigeria to mediate over Zaire; and

pledged further efforts to improve the economic situation in Africa. The Nine

have also been in active touch with the South African Government over the

future of Namibia. They continue to keep events in other parts of Africa under

close review.

5. Continuous attention has been paid to the situation in the Middle East

and the Foreign Ministers have kept one another very fully informed about their

various visits to the area and contacts with the Middle East countries. At the

end of the British Presidency, on 28 June, a statement was issued by the European

Council in London calling for negotiations and restating comprehensively the

position of the Nine on a just and lasting peace settlement. The Nine have

continued to keep in close touch with the Parties involved in the situation in

Cyprus, and to urge them to negotiate a settlement.

6. The second meeting of the General Committee of the Euro/Arab Dialogue

took place in Tunis during February. This meeting, held under British Co-

Presidency, helped to maintain the political and economic impetus of the Dia-

logue and to bring closer to fruition various practical projects of Euro/Arab

27


cooperation. The final communique recorded that both sides were agreed that

the meeting had &quot;succeeded in cementing the idea of the Dialogue&quot;, and in

&quot;strengthening its foundations and procedures&quot;. Discussions among experts

have since continued on a wide range of economic, technical, social and cultural

topics.

Annex 15

Meetings of Community Ministers of the Interior

The second conference of Community Ministers of the Interior and Ministers

with similar responsibilities took place in London at the end of May under the

Chairmanship of Mr Rees. Ministers approved proposals for strengthening

and developing the exchange of information about terrorist acts and techniques

for dealing with terrorist incidents, and for continuing the exchange of experience

gained by Member States in handling such incidents. On general police matters,

Ministers agreed to the establishment of working groups of experts in the tech-

nical field, exchanges of police personnel and the convening of conferences of

experts to consider aspects of police training, and arrangements for developing

cooperation in civil aviation security. They also agreed on the exchange of

expertise within a working group of experts in tackling fire and related tasks.

Other subjects for further study include co-operation over the movement of

firearms between countries. Ministers of the Interior are expected to meet again

next year to review progress.

Annex 16

Grants and Loans from Community Funds

1. In the period from 1 December 1976 to 30 June 1977, the United Kingdom

continued to receive grants and loans from the European Investment Bank, the

European Coal and Steel Community, and the Community regional and social

funds.

European Investment Bank

2. The European Investment Bank approved loans in the United Kingdom

to the value of  144.8 million. The British Steel Corporation received loans of

 12.6 million towards the cost of a new coal handling and blending system at

the Port Talbot works,  2.1 million for the construction of facilities to refurbish

continuous casting moulds at the Corporation&apos;s Distington works, and  17

million for pipe finishing facilities at Clydesdale. A loan of  18 million was ap-

proved to Santa Fe Minerals (UK) Inc for the construction of a steel production

platform in the Thistle North Sea oil field. The National Water Council received

loans of  6 million towards the financing of a dam and reservoir on the Tyne

and a  4 million contribution to the financing of a water supply and sewerage

project in Cornwall. British Petroleum received loans for  19.8 million towards

the construction of an acetic acid plant at Hull and a  10.8 million loan was

approved for an oil pipeline in the North Sea Ninian oil field. The Post Office

were granted a loan of  18.5 million for the development of their telecommunica-

tions network in Northern Ireland and a loan of  8.3 million was granted to the

National Water Council for improved water supplies in North West England.

28


Approval was given to a  14 million loan to the British Steel Corporation for

investment at their Ravenscraig works, and a loan of  7.5 million was granted

to the National Water Council for the financing of a water supply project and

sewerage scheme in Teesside. Very recently, a loan of  6.2 million was approved

to help finance various National Water Council supply projects and sewerage

schemes in Gwent.

European Coal and Steel Community

3. Loans totalling  27.8 million were approved for the United Kingdom

steel industry and loans to the value of  53.1 million were approved for the coal

industry.

Regional Development Fund

4. Allocations from the Fund to the United Kingdom since its inception

amount to  113.32 million. The United Kingdom submitted to the Commission

a preliminary version of its regional development programme covering the

period 1977-79. The programme, which described the United Kingdom&apos;s

regional problems and the measures taken to deal with them, will serve as

background for applications to the Fund from the United Kingdom.

Social Fund

5. The United Kingdom&apos;s allocations from the Social Fund for 1976 totalled

 44.71 million, 24.1 per cent of the Fund&apos;s budget. Applications for 1977 have

been submitted by the United Kingdom amounting to some  127 million.

Annex 17

Relations with Community Institutions

European Assembly

1. British Ministers representing the Presidency have given high priority to

their responsibility for maintaining contacts with other Community institutions

on behalf of the Council. Mr Crosland delivered a major keynote speech to the

European Assembly on 12 January. Dr Owen addressed the Assembly on 20

April. Mr Tomlinson, Minister with special responsibility for relations with the

Assembly, represented the Council at the monthly question time and answered

questions put to the Council and the Conference of Foreign Ministers, as well

as participating in debates on subjects relevant to Presidency responsibilities.

2. In his capacity as President of the Agriculture Council, Mr John Silkin

attended the debate in the Assembly on 22 March on the Commission&apos;s pro-

posals for agricultural support prices in 1977-78.

3. On 19 April Mr Barnett met members of the Budgets Committee of the

Assembly and reported to them on developments at the Joint Council. On 10

May he addressed the Plenary Session of the Assembly on the outcome of the

Joint Council and participated in their subsequent debate. The Assembly and

the Council together constitute the budgetary authority under the Treaty and

have a joint role in the preparation of annual budgets. It was therefore particularly

appropriate that the Assembly should be informed of discussions in the Council

of Ministers on their approach to the 1978 Budget.

29


4. British Ministers held colloquies with the Political Affairs Committee of

the Assembly in London on 15 February and 25 April. These provided the

customary opportunity for the Presidency to inform the Political Affairs

Committee about the Ministerial Political Cooperation meetings held under our

chairmanship and to have a wide exchange of views on progress in political

cooperation more generally.

5. A number of British Ministers acting as Presidents of Specialist Councils

have addressed Committees of the Assembly. Mr Rodgers attended the Com-

mittee on Regional Policy, Regional Planning and Transport on 24 January, and

spoke about his objectives. In particular he expressed the view that the Council

should attempt to avoid preoccupation with detail and should try to agree on

broad political guidelines for the development of the Common Transport

Policy. Mrs Hart attended the Committee on Cooperation and Development

on 30 March. Mr Benn attended the Energy and Research Committee on 26

May, when he gave the Committee a full account of his objectives in the conduct

of the Presidency and answered a wide range of questions on both Community

energy policy and prospects and on the wider international context in which it

must be set.

European Commission

6. At the beginning of the year a new Commission took office under the

Presidency of Mr Roy Jenkins. Mr Tomlinson represented the Presidency of the

Council at the swearing-in ceremony for the new Commission on 11 January at

the European Court of Justice. He and Mr Crosland were present at the lunch

for the new Commission given on 12 January by Mr Spenale the President of

the Assembly. Close contacts were maintained by British Ministers on behalf of

the Presidency with the Commissioners responsible for the work covered by the

various specialist Councils.

Economic and Social Committee

7. On 25 May, Mr Judd attended the Economic and Social Committee,

of which Mr Basil de Ferranti is the British Chairman, and took part in a dis-

cussion of Community work during the United Kingdom Presidency and of

relations with developing countries. Mr John Grant took part in the Committee&apos;s

debate on the economic and social situation in the Community.

8. On 5 April, the Presidents of the three main institutions of the Com-

munities the European Assembly, the Council and the Commission signed a

joint declaration on the protection of fundamental rights in Community law.

In this declaration, the three institutions joined in stressing the prime importance

they attached to the protection of fundamental rights, and in undertaking that,

in the exercise of their powers and in pursuance of the aims of the Communities,

they would continue as at present to protect those rights.

Annex 18

Parliament and the European Communities

1. During the British Presidency, the Scrutiny Committees in both Houses

of Parliament issued special reports reviewing their work over the previous

twelve months and suggesting ways in which the scrutiny and debate procedures

30


might be improved. Both Committees welcomed the progress which had been

made in debating Community documents at an early stage, and the steps which

the Government had taken to improve the flow of information to Parliament.

In this context arrangements were put into effect for informing the House of

changes of substance in major policy proposals which had previously been

reported on by the Scrutiny Committees. The Government also arranged to

provide the House, on its own authority, with up-to-date texts of proposals of

which the original texts were seriously out of date. The Government will be

considering other points raised by the Committees in their special reports.

2. In the period from 1 December 1976 to 30 June 1977, the House of Com-

mons Scrutiny Committee examined and reported on 362 Community documents

of which 85 were recommended for debate. The House of Lords Committee

examined and reported on 306 documents of which 33 were recommended for

debate. Debates were held on 99 documents in the House of Commons and 25 in

the House of Lords. In common with other Member States we have taken steps

to provide for direct elections to the European Assembly in legislation now

before Parliament.
