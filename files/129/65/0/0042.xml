Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1954SECRET-- CAB!NET OFFICE Copy NoC (S4) 42 RECORD COPY8th February, 1954CABINETTHE NATIONAL FOOD SURVEYMemorandum by the Minister of food the National Food Survey was started in 1940 as a means of watching thenation&apos;s diet in war. In its earlier years the Survey was concerned only withworking-class households, but since 1950 its scope has been enlarged. We nowreceive the results of a continuous series of sample enquiries which every quartercover some 3,000 households with a balanced distribution as between geographical areas, town and country, income groups and families of varying size. In this way we obtain much information about food consumption and the effect upon foodhabits of changes in real income. I am advised that the techniques employed aresound and that we can rely upon the results as an indication of current trends.2. My colleagues will be glad to know that the most recent reports, whichcover the period down to October, 1953, are generally satisfactory. A wider range of foods was becoming freely available last year, and there had been a small risein real earnings during the preceding twelve months which the public seem to have spent mainly on food. On average, the nation&apos;s food consumption returned to thebest level at any time since the war, though for special reasons the same level wasreached temporarily in 1950.3. We constantly hear a great deal about old age pensioners, but&apos; the Surveyshows that there is no ground for anxiety about the diet of this section of thepopulation. Their average expenditure on food was not much below the national average and, bearing in mind that the food requirements of old people are insome respects below the average, their nutritional standard was satisfactory.4. But there is a disquieting element. Over the four-year period for whichcomplete figures are available the standard of diet for families with four or more children has been falling. The increase in family alowances in 1952 has not checkedthis trend. Indeed, the same inadequacy of diet has now spread to families with three children and is also seen in those with at least three children and adolescents.Taken together, these larger families account for about 20 per cent, of the popula-tion, and about 40 per cent, of all school-children.5. Since family allowances were increased, families with three children have spent the equivalent of about three-quarters, and families with four or more childrenabout half, of the extra allowance on food. Part of the remainder must have gone to meet the rise in the cost of fuel, light, rent, rates and services (including transport)which amounts to about 6 per cent, in the same period. We do not know how thesefamilies spend all their money. No doubt some of it could ideally be saved for extra food. But the large families do, already, spend about 50 per cent, of their income on food, compared with about 30 per cent, for the country as a whole.6. The chief shortage is of calcium and protein* both especially necessaryto children and adolescents. In the circumstances of to-day we cannot but continueto interest ourselves in nutrition generally, and especially in getting children properlyfed. Any further deterioration must, therefore, be a matter for concern. Milk isthe key to the problem because, even with the special addition of calcium to the loaf,* Details are given in the appendix.45655
bread provides only about half as much calcium as milk for these families. More-over, milk is among the more expensive staple foods and perhaps the first to whichthey turn for savings under economic pressure.7. All this suggests that we must be cautious in our approach to the possibilitiesof reducing the general milk subsidy by increasing the price. But our main concernmust be with the children rather than the public at large. I do not seek at thisstage to make a specific proposal, but there are certain positive steps which couldbe further examined if my colleagues thought fit.8. The Welfare Scheme already provides a full pint daily for children underthe age of five and expectant mothers; and little would be gained by increasing thequantity or further reducing the price. It would also be impracticable to providemilk for older children and adolescents in their homes. But the third of a pintprovided (mostly for five days a week and in term time only) in schools is much less than a school-child needs. I understand that before the war two-thirds of apint was provided in a few schools; and when the war-time scheme was restricted to a third of a pint because milk was scarce, it was publicly stated more than once that the quantity would be raised to two-thirds of a pint when the supply was available. Milk is now so plentiful that we shall, before long, be faced withembarrassment over its disposal. To give extra milk to school-children would reduce the amount going to manufacture and so raise the average realisation price;and for that reason, while the gross cost to the Exchequer might be some  8 million a year, the net cost would be far less than this.9. In the normal course, the National Food Survey Annual Report for 1952would be published early next summer and that for 1953 in the autumn of thisyear. I am being pressed for early publication and have considered the possibilityof publishing condensed versions in advance of the full Annual Reports. But whilepublication will provide a reply to those who have pleaded the cause of the old-age pensioners, it will almost certainly expose us to criticism over the large familiessince despite the measures taken in 1952 to increase family allowances the positionof these families appears to be deteriorating. My colleagues may, therefore, feelthat we should decide whether any special step to help the large families shouldbe announced in advance of publication.Calcium and Protein Intake by Families (Expressed as Percentage of requirements Based on the British Medical Association^Recommendations)G.
