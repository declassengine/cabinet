I:SECRET Copy No. g Gc &quot; 44 CABINET OFFICE, I , RECORD COPYllth February, 1954CABINETRELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET union note by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues the annexed record of a conversation in Berlin between Sir Frank Roberts, Deputy Under-Secretary ofState, Foreign Office, and the Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom.A. E.10th February, 1954.Printed for the Cabinet. February 1954
annex  lunched alone with Mr. Malik yesterday and had a rather more interestingconversation than I had expected. We were both able to talk quite freely., We, talked mainly about Germany. Mr. Malik&apos;s theme was, of course, thedanger of a revival of German militarism, despite our own and French goodintentions over the European Defence Community (E.D.C.), which he did notquestion. He argued, as usual, that the Americans needed continued world tension in order to avoid serious economic trouble, but that on the other hand she wishedto withdraw her boys from Europe and that she must therefore find the necessaryreplacement from the Germans. We should find ourselves faced with an American-German alliance which neither we nor the French could control. Mr. Malik hadno reply to my question that, if the Americans really were going to withdraw from europe, the Soviet Union had no reason to fear the E.D.C., even if it included arearmed Germany. I developed our E.D.C. case fully and gave him every opportunity to propose some practical alternative for dealing with what we bothregarded as a potential German danger. He did not however propose anythingpractical as an alternative.I told Mr. Malik that we were very glad to have got down to serious discussionof the German problem and that we hoped Mr. Molotov would study our plancarefully as a really serious contribution to the solution of the German problem.The few comments he made were not particularly critical, and he certainly implied that it would be seriously studied, although Mr. Molotov Would have ideas of hisown to put forward. Mr. Malik of course argued the case for leaving the germans to arrange their own affairs.I also told Mr. Malik that we hoped we would be able to deal very seriouslywith the Austrian question arid, indeed, to settle it here in Berlin. He agreed thatan Austrian settlement should be possible, provided the&apos; Americans did not insist upon Austria being part of their European military system. This required space,which Austria would provide. He also argued with considerable insistence on thedanger of an Anschluss. I told Mr. Malik that I had heard no suggestion thatAustria should join either the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation or the E.D.C.As regards the Anschluss, the position was now entirely different from that betweenthe two wars. The Austrians had got used to the idea of being a small state insteadof a great empire, and they had found that the Anschluss was not a very successfulalternative. Provided Austria were economically viable, she would wish to retainher independence, and so would we all. I could not therefore understand why theRussians themselves were preventing an economically viable Austria by insistingupon such harsh economic terms in the Treaty.In the course of his many critical remarks about America, Mr. Malik said the trouble about the Americans was that they had profited rather than suffered from two wars and that they approached the German problem light-heartedly becausethey had not suffered from the Germans as we, the French and the Russians had.(Signed)     FRANK K. ROBERTS.Berlin, 31st January, 1954.
