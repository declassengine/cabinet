Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1954SECRET CABINET OFFICE Copy No.C.(54)23 RECORD COPY19th January, 1954CABINETRELATIONS WITH YUGOSLAVIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues should know that I have recently had occasion to complainmore than once to the Yugoslav Ambassador about anti-British articles in the controlled Yugoslav press, especially on Colonial matters. I regret that, in spiteof my complaints, these articles are still being published. I attach, for the informa-tion of my colleagues, a typical specimen (Annex A), together with a record of a conversation between the head of the competent department in the Foreign Officeand the Minister-Counsellor of the Yugoslav Embassy (Annex B).A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,19th January, 1954.ANNEX APobjeda (Cetinje) article &quot; Britain and Her Colonies&quot; of 27th December,speaks of tendencies of Great Powers at U.N.O. during the past year to makea common front against the adoption of a resolution to find factors required for self-determination of dependent countries. At the same time ever increasing pressure is exerted by the English colonial authorities on the natives. Guiana, richin diamonds and sugar, elected a native Government which wanted to secure forits countrymen a little more freedom and bread. This clashed with the basicinterests of the British Empire which forcibly threw the Government out, &amp;c. in malaya British troops had to use arms to secure the exploitation of rubber, sinceguerrillas increased their activity. In Kenya, a country of great mineral and otherwealth, 2,800 Africans were killed in the year, 980 enslaved and 268 wounded. the ratio between killed and captured is explained by the &quot; Shoot to Kill &quot; order.Griffiths was acquitted despite proof that he paid five shillings for every memberof the Mau Mau killed. Lyttelton deposed the King of Uganda because he did not want to submit to orders. The Sudan elections showed that the Sudanese no longerwant the English as teachers. The satisfaction of the Labour Opposition with vagueanswers and lame explanations has caused a sharp reaction in its Left wing. events in the colonies do not at all accord with official statements that the final aim ofBritish colonial policy is that these peoples should get independence as soon aspossible.45535
ANNEX BWhen the Yugoslav Minister-Counsellor came to see me to-day on another matter, I took the opportunity of referring to the unpleasant article summarised in the attached Belgrade Savingram. I reminded M. Petric that the Secretary ofState took a serious view of this kind of article and that Sir I. Kirkpatrick hadalready complained on two occasions to M. Velebit. I pointed out that the article in question took a purely Cominformist line, especially about Kenya and Malaya.While we did not expect the Yugoslav Government to change their theoreticalattitude towards &quot; colonialism,&quot; we had a right to object to a glaring distortion ofthe facts and to suggestions that Her Majesty&apos;s Government were not sincere intheir policy of granting self-government to colonial peoples.2. M. Petric agreed that the article was unfortunate and undertook to bring it to the attention of the authorities in Belgrade.N. J. A. CHEETHAMJanuary 15, 1954.
