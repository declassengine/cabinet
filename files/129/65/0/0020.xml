Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1954CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (54) 2018th January, 1954CABINETTHE UNITED KINGDOMS ASSOCIATION WITH THE european coal AND STEEL community memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in a letter addressed to the Head of the United Kingdom Delegation in luxembourg, M. Jean Monnet, the President of the High Authority of the european coal and Steel Community (E.C.S.C.), said that the High Authority considered thetime had come to give the association of the United Kingdom with the Communityconcrete form by means of an agreement, and asked whether Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were ready to open negotiations. The letter made certain suggestions as tothe form which the association might take.2. The question of our association has been under interdepartmental con-sideration and a report (attached at Annex) has been prepared for the Cabinet,analysing M. monnet  proposals and describing the main political and economicissues relevant to a decision. The conclusions reached are as follows:  (1) The political arguments favour a contractual association between the UnitedKingdom and the E.C.S.C.(2) As regards steel there is a balance of economic advantage in association on the lines proposed in Appendix B of the report, i.e., the creation ofa single market.(3) As regards coal there may be some slight economic advantage in the limited,form of association proposed in Appendix B but, on the other hand,,there may be difficulties in securing the co-operation of the industryand in particular the workers. The Ministry of Fuel and Power wishto reserve their view on the balance of economic advantage for coaluntil the National Coal Board have given them their final conclusionsafter consultation with the National Union of Mineworkers.(4) The suggestions in M. Monnet&apos;s letter of 24th December, 1953 do notappear to preclude an association along the lines of our own proposals.3. The report goes on to recommend that Ministers should decide whether itis desirable in principle to place the association of the United Kingdom with theCommunity on a contractual basis if a satisfactory agreement can be reached, andif so, agree in principle that Appendix B, which visualises a single market for steel and a more limited form of association for coal, forms a satisfactory basis for theopening of any negotiations with the Community.If this is agreed, Ministers are further invited (a) To authorise the Minister of Fuel and Power and the Minister of supply to explain Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs decisions to the coal and steelinterests and to try to secure their support for a form of association onthe lines suggested or, failing that, elicit alternative proposals in the lightof the Governmenfs views.
(b) To agree that the independent Commonwealth Governments (who havealready been informed of M. Monnet&apos;s proposals of 24th December,1953) should-(i) now be told that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are disposed tonegotiate for an advantageous treaty association with theCommunity;(ii) be given the reasons which have led us to reach this conclusion; and(iii) be invited to furnish their observations on our general line.(c) To agree in principle that, provided satisfactory progress is made in thediscussions with the coal and steel interests and the consultations withthe Commonwealth, exploratory discussions (in which the two industries would participate) should be opened with M. Monnet on an informalbasis to determine whether there is a reasonable prospect of securing asatisfactory agreement.4. From the point of view of our European policy I endorse the political arguments in this report in support of the establishment of a contractual association with the Community. If my colleagues endorse the above conclusions and recom-mendations the necessary consultations with the interests concerned and with theindependent Commonwealth countries can begin, followed, if progress is satisfac-tory, by informal and exploratory talks with M. Monnet. Until these consultationshave taken place and the Cabinet have reached a final conclusion on our policy, itwill not be possible to make a conclusive reply to M. monnet  enquiry nor toindicate our views on the subject in Parliament. I should like to be able to make our attitude clear on this point as early as possible, and I therefore hope that thenecessary consultations can be completed quickly.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. I,16th January, 1954.
annex the UNITED KINGDOMS ASSOCIATION WITH THE european coal AND STEEL COMMUNITYIntroductoryMinisters are invited to consider the future relations between the UnitedKingdom and the European Coal and Steel Community (E.C.S.C.).2. After the Treaty setting up the Community had been signed in 1951,statements were made indicating Her Majesty&apos;s Governments attitude towards theCommunity explaining that we were unable to accept the surrender of sovereigntythat would be required by membership, but that we intended to work for anintimate and enduring association with the High Authority and to set up apermanent delegation at the seat of the High Authority for this purpose. Therewas no commitment to enter into a formal or contractual agreement. Since the setting up of the High Authority in August 1952, our association has taken the formof exchange of views and information through the medium of the delegation led by Sir Cecil Weir that was established in Luxembourg soon after the High-Authority took up its task.3. M. Monnet has now written to Sir Cecil Weir (the translated text of this letter, dated 24th December, 1953, is attached as Appendix A), saying that the high authority is ready to open negotiations immediately for the establishment of a more permanent form of association, and asking to be informed at the earliest possible moment of &quot; the intention of the British Government in this respect.&quot; The high authority is empowered to act in such negotiations for its member States as a groupbut it must proceed on the basis of instructions adopted unanimously by theCouncil of Ministers.*4. In his letter, M. Monnet specifically recognises that the British Govern-ment could not accept a form of association that involved the delegation of sovereignty and powers of decision to a. supranational institution. His proposals are expressly designed to forge links between the High Authority and the UnitedKingdom which are consistent with this condition.5. It is also acknowledged that the particular forms of association betweenthe markets of the United Kingdom and the High Authority must be consistent with the provisions of international agreements in force in the field of trade andtariffs (or, if they are not, must be such as will enable the Community and ourselves to obtain whatever dispensations are necessary and permissible under thoseagreements).6. M. monnet  letter does no more than sketch in the broadest outline thekind of association contemplated by the High Authority. The detailed provisions and rules of conduct are left for negotiation. The proposals fall into three parts: -(i) an association between the markets of the United Kingdom and the Com-munity based fundamentally on the reduction and, if possible, the elimination of protective measures which impede trade in coal and steelbetween the two markets. This would be buttressed by certain rules of conduct to be agreed and laid down in advance;(ii) a procedure for consultation which would aim at taking, so far as possible,common action on important matters of common interest;(iii) the creation of joint institutions responsible for carrying out the terms ofthe agreement.(i) Association between the Markets7. The protective measures to be reduced or eliminated are not preciselydefined. The High Authority probably has in mind that this would require: - (a) the reduction or abolition of export controls, quantitative restrictions and customs duties on trade between the two markets; and-.. (b) some agreement on rules for non-discrimination in price policy in regardto international trade in coal and steel between the two markets, inparticular the renunciation of the practices of dual pricing and dumping.* Section 14 of the Convention on Transitional Provisions of the Treaty constituting theEuropean Coal and Steel Community.
8. The High Authority is known to be concerned about other discriminatoryfactors such as differential transport charges and subsidies directly or indirectlyaffecting costs of production of coal and steel which may distort true competition in a free market. The High Authority may seek to raise such issues during thecourse of the negotiations with the object of securing in any agreement at least some provision whereby these problems will be examined with a view to abatingtheir impact on international trade.9. The reference in M. monnet  letter to the &quot; reduction and, if possible, the elimination of reciprocal protective measures &quot; suggests that the High authority may be ready to contemplate an agreement whereby restrictions on trade (or atleast some of them) would be reduced by stages rather than at one blow, or mightby agreement stop short of elimination at a pre-arranged point.10. There is also an indication that some difference in the rules for coal  andsteel may be contemplated to take account of the different characteristics of thetwo markets.11. No mention is made of the duration of any agreement that may bereached. This is presumably left for negotiation. It is to be assumed, however,that the High Authority would hope for a period sufficiently long to enable theindustries concerned to plan ahead with confidence in the stability of the arrange-ments agreed upon and so realise to a greater extent the economic advantagesaimed at.(ii) Procedure for Common Action.12. A clear distinction is drawn between the removal of restrictions on trade(discussed in paragraphs 7 to 11 above) and other matters of common interest. Asregards the former the parties to the agreement would accept an obligation to implement certain commitments and observe certain rules of conduct which wouldbe defined in advance. As regards the latter there would merely be an undertaking to consult on important matters in order to offer either party the alternative of taking joint action by agreement or of proceeding unilaterally: the only bindingobligation would be to consult.13. M. Monnet contemplates that consultation would take place, for example,in regard to general objectives for modernisation, production and expansion of capacity and in regard to conditions of severe surplus or shortage of coal and steel.It is also contemplated that there would be a continuous joint review of markettrends and prospects and of conditions of life and work within the coal and steel industries.14. These, however, are cited only as examples. The High Authority may seek to include in these consultative arrangements such topics as action to dealwith monopolistic agreements among enterprises to restrict the normal operationof competition and policy with regard to sales in third markets.(iii) Institutions of the Association15.   The High Authority envisages three types of institution:  (a) a joint Council of Association which would be responsible for implementing the Agreement;(b) some body to settle differences of interpretation of the Agreement;(c) a forum for public discussion which would associate public opinion withthis new endeavour.The proposals on (b) and (c) above have been left vague at this stage. The implications-tions of these proposals are discussed in paragraphs 23 to 25 below.16. The question is whether we should respond to M. monnet  approach and agree to enter into negotiations with a view to placing our relations with theCommunity on a contractual basis. In order to assist Ministers to reach a decisionon this question of principle, we have set out in the following sections the moreimportant political and economic considerations. With regard to the latter, theeconomic implications of association have already been studied by an official working Party who have worked out a possible basis for association. An extractof the proposed arrangements is contained in Appendix B, and this represents inour opinion the furthest we should go. Such a form of association would appearto be consistent with the framework outlined by M. Monnet., though there is scope for other variants.
Political Considerations17. It will be necessary to set any contractual association between the UnitedKingdom and the Community within the framework of our general Europeanpolicy. This can be summarised as support for the political, economic and militaryintegration of the Western European countries, as providing a means of increasingthe political and economic strength and stability of the area, both in order tostrengthen the Western alliance and to make it resistant to Communism, and toprovide a means of locking Germany within the Western Community. Nevertheless,Her Majesty&apos;s Government have always taken the view that our position as a worldPower makes it impossible for the United Kingdom to contemplate surrenderingany part of its sovereignty to a European supranational body. We have, therefore,assumed that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would not be prepared to surrender toorgans of the Community control over the United Kingdom coal and steel industries and the trade in their products, and that United Kingdom membership of theCommunity is therefore excluded. As we have mentioned, the High Authorityaccepts this position.18. There are strong political arguments in favour of making the United King-dom association with the Community as close as possible consistent with fullretention of sovereignty. By doing so, we shall be giving our support to the onepractical embodiment of the integration movement which already exists, and inwhich some initial success has already been achieved. The member Governments,including the German Federal Government, have co-operated loyally with theHigh Authority and a useful beginning has, therefore, been made in welding theFederal Republic into an integrated Western Europe. Close United Kingdomassociation would provide support to this development. It would also fit in withthe association which we have agreed to establish with the European defence community (E.D.C.), and which we shall in due course have to establish with theEuropean Political Community. The latter is planned to provide political controlover, and eventually to absorb, the Coal and Steel and Defence Communities, andthe United Kingdom association with these two would, therefore, be transferred tothe E.P.C. Further, we must bear in mind the risk that a unified Western Europemight, if politically isolated, establish undesirably close links with the Soviet bloc.Close United Kingdom association with the Community would be likely to impedeany such development and would in any case make it easier for us to keep watchon contacts between the Community and the bloc. At the least, it would reducethe risk of the Community becoming dominated by elements working for the exclusion of the United Kingdom from Europe, or otherwise acting to the detriment of the United Kingdom position whether politically or economically.19. Even if the E.D.C. were to fail and the whole integration movement toreceive thereby a serious setback, we cannot assume that the E.C.S.C. itself would necessarily founder. It has already shown that it possesses a life of its own, andunder these circumstances it might well be desirable for the United Kingdom tohelp to salvage as much as possible of the integration movement; the objects of doing so would be to retain Germany within the Western European frameworkand to enable the Community to continue to exercise a degree of supervision overthe basic industries on which the German war-making potential is based. Alterna-tively, if Germany were unified, it would be all the more important to keep the unified country within the European integration movement and so subject to western influence. On both these hypotheses, it would be desirable for the UnitedKingdom to associate as closely as possible with the Community.20. The essence of the Community lies in the creation of a single marketwithin which tariffs, exchange controls, quantitative controls and discriminatorypricing practices have been removed. Therefore the formation of some form ofcommon market* between the United Kingdom and the Community (which is what M. monnet  proposal for an association of the two markets really amountsto) is the step which is likely to have the greatest political appeal in the six countries.It would show that we genuinely wished to come as close as possible to the* The phrase translated &quot;common market&quot; has been used variously to denote simply a marketfree of tariff or quantitative restrictions or the whole complex of rules and procedures laid down bythe Schuman Treaty. M. Monnet prefers to use it in the latter sense (hence the words &quot; properlyso called&quot; in the eighth paragraph of his letter-see Appendix A) but throughout this paper andin Appendix B &quot; common market&quot; is used in the former and more limited sense.
Community. On the face of it, the establishment of a form of common marketembracing the United Kingdom and the six countries in which there would be nointernal barriers but the maintenance of restrictions against the outside world, might appear inconsistent with the United kingdom&apos;s &quot;one world&quot; approach to a systemof freer trade on a multilateral basis. To discriminate in favour of a regional systemsuch as the Community could be represented as a divergence from this policy.But this may be justified by the gains derived from the enlarged area of freer tradein coal and steel which a closer association with the Community would bring about,so long as the wider market so created does not seek to insulate itself from worldcompetition. Moreover, by our close association with the Community, we shouldbe able the better to influence it in the direction of removing trade barriers anddismantling discriminatory arrangements, and thus protecting the interests of thirdPowers.21. Nevertheless, it might be difficult to remove all misunderstanding of ourmotives and it is possible that if such misunderstanding persisted it might haveunwelcome consequences. For example, the Scandinavian countries might cease to regard the United Kingdom as an alternative centre for a European grouping(as expressed at present in Uniscan) and decide to throw in their lot with theCommunity. While we could have no objection to the Scandinavian countries beingclosely associated with the Community in the same way as ourselves, one or more of. them might decide to go further and to join the Community as full members.Nevertheless, we must be prepared to face risks of this kind if we are to obtainthe advantages of a really close association with the Community, and in any caseDenmark may be drawn into membership even if we do not ourselves form a contractual association with the Community.22. These arguments all lead to the conclusions first, that, provided there isno abrogation of sovereignty, the closer the association between the United Kingdomand the E.C.S.C. the better; secondly, that it is politically desirable to place this association on a contractual basis if a satisfactory agreement can be negotiated; and,thirdly, that the politically most effective arrangement would be an association which included the establishment of some form of single market between the UnitedKingdom and the Community.Institutional Arrangements23. The establishment of a really close association with the Community willrequire the adoption of appropriate institutional arrangements for contact betweenthe United Kingdom and the Community. M. Monnet has suggested the creationof a Council of Association composed of three members of the High authority and three United Kingdom representatives, to carry out the agreement and todiscuss the application of the rules of conduct. If such a Council were composed,on the United Kingdom side, of the Head of the British Delegation and of repre-sentatives of the National Coal Board and the Iron and Steel Board, this would serve the purpose of bringing United Kingdom coal and steel interests into direct contact with the High Authority.24. M. Monnet has also suggested that it would be appropriate to consider how differences arising between the two contracting parties relating to the applica-tion of the agreed rules should be settled. He does not suggest any particular formof procedure. It would not be acceptable, nor does it seem to be contemplated,that the United Kingdom should come under the jurisdiction of the Community&apos;sown organ, the High Court provided for in the Treaty constituting the Community.On the other hand, there is a case for considering whether some special procedurecan be devised providing for a means of arbitration for disputes where the parties have accepted in the agreement an obligation to observe specific rules of conduct.25. M. Monnet has further suggested that steps should be taken to provide for public discussion of the actions of the Council of Association. We know froman earlier approach which he made to Lord Salisbury that he has in mind jointmeetings of Parliamentary representatives and members of the Common Assemblyof the Community. Any arrangement of this sort would be open to Objections, onthe grounds that it implied a closer approach to membership of the Communitythan is desirable, that it would add another institution to an already cumbrousmachinery of consultation, that it would deprive of value the existing joint meetingsof the Common Assembly with the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe
and so damage the position of the latter as a link between Big Europe and LittleEurope, and that the place in which United Kingdom Members of Parliament shouldmake their views known about our relationship with the Community is Parliamentitself.  It is therefore considered that the suggestion should be opposed.Economic Considerations26. From the economic point of view the main features of the E.C.S.C.are:  (i) It is an attempt to create a single competitive and non-discriminatorymarket which will enable buyers of coal and steel to purchase fromthe cheapest and best sources.(ii) The Community is bound together for a sufficiently long time to giveopportunity for the structure of the two industries to develop on abasis of economic efficiency within a substantial common market. Inthis connection the High Authority has been given certain powers toco-ordinate and stimulate investment.(iii) There are safeguards to avoid sudden and painful adjustments during the transition stage.(iv) There is provision for policing the market and regulating it in abnormalconditions, viz., to suppress monopolistic agreements and to dealwith crises in times of glut and serious shortage. In the past the sharp,cyclical fluctuations experienced by the coal and steel industries have led to cartels among producers and autarchic policies by Governments.(v) There is machinery for bringing the public interest to bear on the conductof these two basic industries.This is a large-scale economic experiment by a group which at present producesthe same amount of coal and rather more than twice as much steel as the UnitedKingdom.   If successful, it could create a unit of great economic power.27. The question for decision is whether we should seek to come to termsnow with the Community on a basis of close co-operation and mutual advantage.The broad economic case for such an arrangement is that it would provide a widerand freer market in two commodities which are at the foundation of our industrialpower and in which we as a great trading nation cannot afford to be uncompetitive.Furthermore the form of co-operation offered would provide opportunity for theUnited Kingdom, without surrender of sovereignty, to bring close and continuousinfluence to bear on the conduct and development of the Community itself. Inpractice, coal and steel raise different issues, which are dealt with separately below.Steel28. Our vital interest, as a large steel consuming country and a great exporterof manufactured goods made from steel, is in having access to steady and plentifulsupplies of cheap steel. This is cardinal to stiffening our competitive power in world markets, and it is to the engineering industries that we look more than ever to provide the extra export earnings we need. Cheap and plentiful steel is also important to the objective of stepping up productive capital investment andre-equipping and modernising plant and machinery in the interests of higher productivity. The British steel industry is now technically efficient and fully com-petitive with other producers. It is well on the way with its second post-warexpansion plan. It should be an aim of economic policy to ensure that every possible stimulus is given to the industry and the Iron and Steel Board* to increasethe industry&apos;s strength and efficiency. Competition from outside the UnitedKingdom should be a potent stimulus, but a straight removal of protective tariffs on steel would expose the United Kingdom to serious dangers. There would beno existing arrangement to which the industry could look for adequate protection from unfair practices, such as dumping in times of surplus, from any part of theworld. The result of unrestricted competition of this kind would be violentfluctuations in prices and production. The experience of the 1920&apos;s and 1930&apos;sshows that this would work against the assurance of a steady and adequate flow of steel supplies that is so desirable.* Under the Iron and Steel Act, 1953, the Iron and Steel Board is responsible for promoting the. efficient, economic, and adequate supply, under competitive conditions, of iron and steel products.
29. But a step could be taken towards greater competition and a widermarket for steel without running the risks indicated above. This is the centralfeature of the proposals put forward by the Working Party. They suggest thatthe United Kingdom might join with the E.C.S.C. in a free competitive market for steel. This would put our industry into direct competition over a wide area withthe large and powerful Continental producers, and provide it with a spur tomaintain and enhance the efficiency upon which the competitiveness of ourengineering industries depends. The Working Party also suggested that it wouldbe necessary, and should be possible, to come to an agreement which would includeadequate safeguards against instability of prices and production and unfair prac-tices in times of severe shortage or surplus. In short, the association wOuldcomprise the advantageous economic features of a single market for steel but wouldspecifically exclude any delegation of sovereignty or pooling of resources to acommon institution subjected to &quot; alien &quot; control.30. The retention of power to suspend or modify the full rigour of the singlemarket in times of severe shortage or surplus would have to be an essential feature of any closer association. Provision for this already exists within the community in relation to their own market. Such an arrangement applied to both the UnitedKingdom and Community markets would, of course, be invoked only after con-sultation. When this happened the two parties would have the power severallyto impose restrictions on trade and local controls on prices and supplies. Thereshould be provision for discussions between them on the fixing of prices and theallocation of supplies in order to mitigate the worst effects of serious shortage orsurplus, e.g., price cutting and dumping in surplus or the undue raising of prices or unilateral cutting of supplies in shortage. But neither when the single market was in force nor when it was suspended would the High Authority have any juris-diction over the British steel industry. Arrangements of this kind in respect ofsteel would probably require power to prescribe minimum prices and for this legislation would be needed.31. In a wide trade and payments system such as it is the United Kingdom&apos;policy to work towards, there would have to be an escape clause which, althoughstringent, would provide for the imposition of quantitative restrictions in the eventof a balance of payments crisis. It can be assumed that these would have to beapplied in a non-discriminatory way, save perhaps against a persistent creditor.An agreement not to impose quantitative.restrictions upon coal and steel from theCommunity even when we were in balance of payments difficulties would thuscreate an exception to such a rule besides renouncing our power to limit imports ofcoal and steel by direct means. It is of course the essence of the single market idea that it should be free from any extraneous disturbances to the flow of trade. Itmight be possible to provide for a balance of payments escape clause in any associa-tion with the Community, though if we did so the High Authority would doubtlessinsist upon it being reciprocal. If such an escape clause could not be negotiated,the securing of the advantages of association with the Community&apos;s single market would involve the acceptance of a greater limitation on our freedom to manoeuvrein the event of a balance of payments crisis than would be provided in the traderules under the Collective Approach. An obligation which implied an open doorfor imports of coal and steel from all sources could in certain circumstances involvea considerable balance of payments risk; but this might be well worth taking.32. Such an association would mean granting duty-free entry to steel from theCommunity while keeping tariffs on steel from other parts of the world. A waiverwould be needed from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.),just as the Community had to apply for a waiver when the original common market was set up. The G.A.T.T. would no doubt require us to accept the same condition as they did: namely that our external tariffs to the rest of the world should be&quot; harmonised &quot; with those of the rest of the Community, which would in our casemean a considerable reduction. Even so it might be difficult to get the waiver,bearing in mind that we are proposing an association with a right of withdrawal.We cannot tell how the voting might go if we applied for one. If it were suggestedthat it did not fit in with our wider interests to become parties to a local preferentialsystem, we could point out that such a system is already in existence within theCommunity; it is far from restrictive in its stated aims; and if we joined it we shouldbe extending free trade over a wider area with lower external barriers than before.If in the event we failed to obtain the waiver, the scope of our association wouldhave to be less ambitious.
33.   The disadvantages of such an association would be:  (i) United Kingdom and Community home steel prices would inevitably move to a common level, and as United Kingdom prices are at present lower than Continental prices, this would mean some increase in United King-dom prices. But the gap between United Kingdom and Continentalprices is in any event likely to narrow or even disappear. UnitedKingdom prices have been held down in the face of rising costs (towhich may shortly be added higher transport charges) and some pricesmay have to be increased before long. Meanwhile Continental pro-ducers are reported to be selling freely below their published prices.The premiums on United Kingdom exports would, of course, vanish.However, these have been diminishing for some time.(ii) As a result of the free play of the market we might in some cases becomedependent on the Community for specialised steel products, and this might entail a strategic disadvantage. In time of war we are likely tohave to make substantial imports of steel anyway, and no doubt extra-ordinary measures could be taken in conjunction with our allies to getover some of these difficulties, though there is no guarantee that weshould not find ourselves short of some essential steel products, at anyrate for a time.(iii) The establishment of a single market for steel would mean that we could not longer retain our export controls to keep in this country special types of steel in high demand, e.g., for use in our shipbuilding industry.(iv) The case for association rest on the assumption that the Community rules for regulating the industry and creating truly competitive conditionswill be properly enforced. If they cannot and there are indications that the rules are in some cases being broken with impunity-the UnitedKingdom industry might be exposed to some of the pre-war difficultieswhich the pre-war tariff was designed to prevent. However, risks ofthis character are a feature of any international agreement and shouldnot be overrated. It would be necessary in the negotiations to insist on adequate safeguards for the enforcement of rules and undertakings;failure to carry them out would be a breach of the contract.(v) An announcement of the Government^ intention to associate with theCommunity might create uncertainty among investors in iron and steelshares being realised by the Iron and Steel Holding and RealisationAgency, with possible consequential loss to the Exchequer. Suchuncertainty might however be removed by adequate explanation of our intentions.34.   The Commonwealth Position. An agreement on these lines might giverise to apprehensions in the Commonwealth, which if they were not checked mightadversely affect our trade relations or lead to some retaliation such as the reductionof our preferences in Commonwealth markets.   It is most important, therefore,that the independent Commonwealth countries should be consulted before we enterinto any undertakings with the Community.  But while the importance of such astep cannot be denied, the practical effects on the Commonwealth countries wouldbe negligible. By establishing the single market we should be removing a preferencethat Commonwealth steel producers now enjoy over the Community in the UnitedKingdom market, and by reducing our external tariff towards other countries weshould be reducing the Commonwealth preference over them too.  But, althoughCanada and Australia may have other ideas for the future, imports from theCommonwealth are now no more than 50,000 tons a year and we do not foreseeany great increase. There would be no question of the independent commonwealth countries being asked to grant to the Community preferences on steel similar tothose enjoyed by the United Kingdom, though we shall probably have to extend to the Community our preferenecs in the Colonial markets, a concession that wecould reasonably make as part of the negotiations.  An agreement about steel in times of shortage and surplus might be represented as having an adverse effect on prices and supplies for the Commonwealth which at present takes nearly two-thirds of all its steel from the United Kingdom or the Community.  But we can assure the Commonwealth that our association with the Community would be on the firmunderstanding that it was not a restrictive cartel.  It can also be pointed out that
a contractual association between the Community and the United Kingdom wouldprobably ensure fairer treatment than the kind of private agreement amongproducers that would be the likely alternative.35. Though the Iron and Steel Board have not yet been asked to state theirviews, the Minister of Supply has had exploratory discussions with them. It seems likely that the Board will see no clear balance of advantage or disadvantage to the steel industry and steel consumers in an association of the kind proposed in theWorking Party&apos;s report, though they may perhaps be more conscious of the risks of association than of the risks of remaining outside the Community. The british iron and Steel Federation see the advantage of maintaining close working contacts with the Community, but like the Board are unlikely to have reached the point atwhich they see a balance of advantage in a contractual association. If, however,the Government should decide that an association with the Community is desirable,having regard, among other things, to broad grounds of international policy and tothe promotion of stability and peace in Europe, it is unlikely that the Board or theindustry would pursue their opposition to it.36. The Economic Planning Board attached importance to the generalargument in favour of closer association on steel that it would give this country a clear right to influence the development of a highly important industrial and semi-political community which we could not afford to see develop in ways which mightadversely affect our interests; bearing in mind also the prime importance of engineering industries in our export effort, they saw quite strong advantages in taking a step which would help to ensure that our steel industry remained highlycompetitive.Coal37. Our main objective in coal is the same as in steel to have adequate supplies of cheap coal but there the resemblance ends. The National Coal board have a statutory duty to break even over a period of years and they, therefore,do not seek to make a profit in the usual commercial sense of the term.38. To enter the common market for coal would create certain difficulties.If it were to be a genuine common market and coal were to flow freely betweenthe United Kingdom and the Community countries, the price of coal in the two areas would have to be assimilated and therefore, presumably, the price of UnitedKingdom coal would rise somewhat. As the total quantity of exports from theUnited Kingdom to the Community would at the best be marginal, it is difficult to forecast the extent of the rise in price. Fundamentally, the coal problem is one ofsupply and it is not clear that entering the common market for coal would have any effect on home production, and it is doubtful whether the United kingdom could in normal conditions be a very significant market for European coal. Itwould indeed remove such external barriers as there are to our coal exports, buton the whole the main limitation since the war has been the lack of supplies, and unless this was greatly changed there would be no way in which we could takeadvantage of the opportunity of increasing our exports which a common marketmight create. Furthermore, there is some evidence to show that the increasedrequirements of energy in the Community countries would be likely to be met toa large degree by primary fuels such as oil and hydro-electricity and, therefore, thepossibilities of an expanded market for United Kingdom exports in the community countries may be rather smaller than has hitherto been envisaged.39. Even though we cannot hope for any big expansion in our exports, itwill always be important to secure a market for such coal as is available. There isa danger that we might be excluded from the Community markets in times of surplus if we were not associated with them. For this reason the Working Partyput forward a compromise proposal: they suggested that without entering thecommon market we should exchange assurances with the Community about thelevel and prices of our exports with the object of:  (i) preventing the Community from suddenly stopping imports of British coalin a time of surplus; and(ii) encouraging them in the longer term to rely on the United Kingdom as a source of supply instead of going all out for self-sufficiency.
40. Care should be taken in the negotiations to ensure that in any such arrangements the supply of coking coal for our own steel industry were not put at risk, especially as the High Authority might seek to establish that a single market for steel should carry with it equal access to all the raw materials needed for steel-making.41. The provisional views of the National Coal Board on M. Monnefsproposals are:  (a) They agree that there might be wide considerations of a general kind whichmight make it necessary for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to enter into negotiations with the High Authority as proposed by M. Monnet, but so far as the coal industry itself was concerned, they doubt whether therewould be any balance of advantage resulting from such negotiations.In particular, they suggest that there are various ways in which the coalindustry in the Schuman countries now succeed in circumventing itsformal obligations made under the Treaty, and they foresee inevitableembarrassment if this country became in any way subject to rules whichpurported to bind both the United Kingdom coal industry and that ofthe Schuman countries.(b) If negotiations are to take place, the National Coal Board would wish tobe closely associated with them and to be present at them.(c) The Board are confident that proposals to remove all restrictions on theimport of coal into the United Kingdom would arouse feeling among theminers and lead to strong representations from the National Union of mineworkers.(d) The procedure outlined in M. monnet  proposals for common actionbetween the United Kingdom and the High Authority would ofteninvolve the coalmining industry in delays in carrying on necessaryactivities. They are already subject to many delays, particularly incarrying out developments, and they are reluctant to add to them.42. The National Coal Board seem to be genuinely concerned at the effects ofan association with the Community though in giving expression to that concern theymay have overstressed the difficulties. Nevertheless, as stated above, the national coal Board would, if Ministers decided that such an association was in the national interest, co-operate in devising a limited association in respect of coal provided theBoard took part in negotiations. It is not easy to anticipate what will be theattitude of the National Union of Mineworkers, who have not yet been consulted,even on a provisional basis. If Ministers decided in favour of negotiating an association, the Ministry of Fuel and Power would undertake further consultationwith a view to securing the co-operation of the National Coal Board and theNational Union of Mineworkers.43. The Ministry of Fuel and Power feel that there might be considerableeconomic advantage for coal in a contractual association with the Community, butequally if the negotiation of that association led to serious difficulties with theNational Union of Mineworkers there might be serious disadvantages. Accordingly,until there has been further discussion with the Board and the National Union of mineworkers, the Ministry of Fuel and Power find it necessary to suspend judgment on the economic advantage.44. The Economic Planning Board, who considered the Working Party&apos;sreport before M. monnet  invitation had been received, doubted whether there wason balance any economic advantage in becoming associated with the community as regards coal even in the limited way suggested by the Working Party.Conclusions45.   We consider (1) that the political arguments favour a contractual association between theUnited Kingdom and the E.C.S.C.;(2) that as regards steel there is a balance of economic advantage in associa-tion on the lines proposed in Appendix B, i.e., the creation of a singlemarket;45525    &apos; c 2
,(3) that as regards coal there may be some slight economic advantage in the limited form of association proposed in Appendix B but, on the otherhand, there may be difficulties in securing the co-operation of theindustry and in particular the workers. The Ministry of Fuel and Powerwish to reserve their view on the balance of economic advantage for coaluntil the National Coal Board have given them their final conclusionsafter consultation with the National Union of Mineworkers;(4) that the suggestions in M. monnet  letter of 24th December, 1953 do notappear to preclude an association along the lines of our own proposals.Recommendations46. Ministers are invited to decide whether it is desirable in principle to place the association of the United Kingdom with the Community on a contractual basisif a satisfactory agreement can be reached, and if so, to agree in principle thatAppendix B, which visualises a single market for steel and a more limited formof association for coal, forms a satisfactory basis for the opening of any negotiationswith the Community.47.   If this is agreed, Ministers are further invited:  (a) To agree that the Minister of Fuel and Power and the Minister of supply should explain to the coal and steel interests that Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are disposed to proceed as in (1) above; and that they should endeavour to secure their support for a form of association on the lines suggested or, failing that, elicit alternative proposals in the light of theGovernments views.(b) To agree that the independent Commonwealth Governments (who havealready been informed of M. monnet  proposals of 24th December,1953) should-(i) now be told that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are disposed tonegotiate for an advantageous treaty association with theCommunity;(ii) be given the reasons which have led us to reach this conclusion; and(iii) be invited to furnish their observations on our general line.(c) To agree in principle that, provided satisfactory progress is made in thediscussions with the coal and steel interests and the consultations withthe Commonwealth, exploratory discussions (in which the two industries would participate) should be opened with M. Monnet on an informalbasis to determine whether there is a reasonable prospect of. securing asatisfactory agreement.APPENDIX a text of M. Monnet&apos;s Letter to Sir Cecil WeirYour Excellency, Luxembourg, 24th December, 1953.As from 11th August, 1952, the day after the High Authority took up its duties, the British Government declared its intention of establishing an intimateand enduring association with the Community, and appointed you to representit in the preparation of this association.The High Authority immediately expressed the satisfaction with which itwelcomed the intention of the British Government and its own confidence in thedevelopment of this association.On 17th November, 1952, the first meeting was held of the Joint Committeewhich we had agreed to set up, and in which both the High Authority and yourDelegation participated, whilst your experts and those of the High Authority mettogether in a number of Working Parties. At the time of the session of the CommonAssembly held at Strasbourg in June, 1953, the High Authority stated that it was preparing to make proposals to the British Government on the method of bringing about the association which is our common objective.It appears to-day, now that the common market in coal and steel has become a reality and we have seen, in practice, how the institutions of the Community
function, the time has come to establish by agreement the concrete form of this association. You are requested to be so good as to inform the United KingdomGovernment that the High Authority is ready for its part immediately to open the necessary negotiations. The High Authority would wish to know at the earliestpossible moment the intention of the British Government in this respect.The High Authority has attempted to clarify the way in which this associationmight develop. It ventures to submit certain suggestions to the British Govern-ment: these suggestions naturally leave open numerous questions which could arise in the course of negotiations.The object of the association between the Community and the United kingdom is to contribute to their common prosperity by establishing together the prospects for the development of their coal and steel production, by concerting their actionin the field of these industries, and by enabling their economies to benefit fromwider competition and from a better assurance of supplies and markets.It appears to the High Authority that the solutions which will be found shouldbe such as to bring the greatest advantage not only to the Community and theUnited Kingdom, but also to the development of international trade in an expanding world economy.The establishment of a common market, properly so called, and the sum ofthe advantages which flow from it, could only, in our opinion, be realised by apooling of resources, and by the creation of common institutions to which shouldbe accorded a delegation of sovereignty and certain powers of decision. The BritishGovernment has declared that it could not envisage such a solution. The high authority, in its desire to establish the closest ties that these basic facts allow,proposes, as a means of association between the Community and the UnitedKingdom, the following as essential points:  An association between the markets by virtue of the reduction, and ifpossible, the elimination, of reciprocal protective measures, and the institution of rules which each party undertakes to respect.A procedure for common action.Joint institutions responsible for watching over the operation of thesystem, for preparing common action, and for taking decisions reached in common agreement.The High Authority wishes to add certain explanations on these points:  (.1) Association Between the MarketsThe association should have the object of reducing or eliminating restrictivemeasures which impede coal trade, as well as the reduction or elimination of quantitative restrictions and customs duties on steel.The High Authority feels obliged to recall that as regards problems arisingout of paragraph 14 of the Convention on the Transitional Provisions, it mustobtain instructions from the Council of Ministers of the Community. It will further be necessary to ensure that forms of association between our markets are consistent with the provisions of international agreements in force in the field oftrade and customs questions.In order to ensure that the association of the markets made possible by thereduction or elimination of protective measures, should produce the most economicresults, the exchanges between them should be subjected to certain rules whichshould moreover take account of the characteristics of the coal market on the onehand and the steel market on the other. These rules should be established in theform of reciprocal undertakings between the United Kingdom and the Community.It is natural that the High Authority should, for its part, seek these along the linesof those provided for in the Treaty constituting the Community.(2) Procedure for Common action the common action should proceed from an exchange of information to decisions concerted together and valid for the whole of the two markets. TheHigh Authority and the Government of the United Kingdom should togetherundertake a continuing examination of the trend of the market and of the living conditions of the labour force, and establish in common the long-term outlook for consumption and exports.
In the absence of any surrender of sovereignty to institutions responsible for taking decisions on the common account, and for the common benefit, the high authority has envisaged the following procedure: In regard to important actionscontemplated by either party such as the establishment of general objectives formodernisation, the direction of production, and the expansion of productivecapacity, or such actions as temporary measures designed to deal with the difficultiesof the market, the contracting party which envisages the action would consult withthe other, and would offer the alternatives of undertaking common action in agree-ment for the whole of the two markets, or allowing the other party to proceedunilaterally to the action envisaged.(3) Institutions of the AssociationWhatever may be the technical provisions which are agreed the High Authoritybelieves that to put them into operation and to give them their full political importance, it would be appropriate to envisage the establishment of joint institu-tions responsible for watching over the operation and the development of theassociation.It is for this reason that the High Authority suggest the creation of a Councilof Association which might be composed of three members of the High Authorityappointed by it, and three members appointed by the United Kingdom Government.The Council could meet periodically to discuss the application of the rules agreed for the trade between the markets, to prepare the actions to be undertaken in common, or to take decisions reached by common agreement.It would be appropriate to consider how to settle differences of interpretationrelating to the application of the rules agreed, or in respect of the conditions inwhich each contracting party had given effect to concerted actions.Finally, the High Authority considers it desirable that the actions of the Councilof Association should be the subject of public discussion in a form to be decided.The High Authority is, of course, open to any constructive solution which willassociate public opinion with the progress of this new form of international relation-ship which we are going to establish together.JEAN MONNET,President de la Haute Autorite.APPENDIX BProposals Contained in a Report by a Working Party of Officials on theEconomic Implications of an Association between the UnitedKingdom and the European Coal and Steel community the Report by a Working Party of Officials on the Economic Implications ofan association between the United Kingdom and the E.C.S.C (E.S. (53) 21) con-tained suggestions for an agreement with the Community that would, in their view,be workable and entail some long-term economic advantage. These proposals are fully discussed in Chapters 4 (Steel) and 6 (Coal) of that Report. The main features are as follows:  &quot; Steel(a) Establishment of a common market between the United Kingdom and theCommunity: i.e., no tariffs, currency restrictions or trade restrictions(except as at (b) below), and no discrimination in prices or other con-ditions of sale between United Kingdom and Community conditions of sale between United Kingdom and Community consumers, British steel prices to be published and to follow the Community&apos;s basing-point pricesystem.(b) Agreement on common action in times of surplus or shortage and towardsthird markets:  (i) in surplus the United Kingdom would be ready to agree onminimum prices in the common market and to a mutual reductionof trade between the United Kingdom and the Community;
(ii) in shortage the United Kingdom and the Community would agreeto consult on maximum prices throughout the area, and on an allocation of each partners expected supplies between home con-sumption, exports to the other partner, and exports to third countries;(iii) the United Kingdom and the Community to be ready to consult atany time about action in third markets, e.g., on minimum export prices in surplus.(c) The Community to benefit from our preferences in Colonial markets [butnot in independent Commonwealth markets].Coal(d) The High Authority to agree to permit free entry of British coal at all timeswithin a certain quota and the United Kingdom to agree to offer at all times a certain amount. This would call for an understanding abouttypes and qualities.(e) The United Kingdom to adopt some agreed price policy for coal exported to the Community e.g., the National Coal Board to quote the samef.o.b. price to all Community countries, but also to be free to align their prices in particular markets with supplies from other sources where these were lower.(/) In surplus the United Kingdom to agree not to &apos; dump,&apos; i.e., charge aprice to the Community lower than inland prices.(g) The United Kingdom might also allow free import of coal from theCommunity.General(h) Consultation as to when a situation of scarcity or surplus should be declared.(/) Full exchange of information on investment plans.(/) General exchange of information and co-operation on research.(k) The United Kingdom not to intervene governmentally in the fixing oftransport charges in such a way as to cause discrimination on accountof the foreign origin or destination of goods and to issue a request tothe British Transport&apos; Commission to observe this principle.(/) The exchange of general assurances about the control of producers&apos; agree-ments that were likely to inhibit other arrangements.(m) We could also agree if necessary to exchange assurances about the move-ment of labour and wages.As to the period of the treaty, so long as we were allowed some right of with-drawal there could be no economic objection to its being valid for the full 50 yearsof the Schuman Treaty itself.... To safeguard our own interests and to prevent anyparticular dislocations that could be foreseen When the Treaty came into force weshould need to ask for a short transitional period in which the full rigour of our treaty did not apply; thereafter we might provide for a right of withdrawal given,say, a year&apos;s notice on either side.&quot;
