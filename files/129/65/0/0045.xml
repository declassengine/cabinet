egypt memorandum by the Lord chancellor the Cabinet considered on 20th January the possible courses of action which would be open to the Government in the event of a break-down in the defence negotiations with Egypt.    They were disposed to agreethat the best policy in those circumstances would be to wind up the base in the Canal Zone, to re-deploy our forces in the Middle East in our owntime, and to state that we are standing on our rights under the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936.    We should then aim at reducing our troops inEgypt within two years to the numbers (10,000 land forces, and 400 pilotswith the necessary ancillaries for administrative and technical duties)allowed by the Treaty.    The Cabinet appointed a Committee under my chairmanship to consider how the minimum military security of such a force could be reconciled with the other provisions of the Treaty,2.        The Chiefs of Staff, after consultation with the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, have prepared a military plan for carrying out thispolicy.    This is outlined in the Appendix.Briefly, the military authorities would propose to wind up the base by clearing Tel El Kebir first and rolling up from the south.    The10,000, together with 2,000 R.A.F., would eventually take up their positionin an area round Moas car/Abu-Sueir, which contains one good airfield.They would then be adjacent to a land-force Treaty area, though not within it:  it would not be practicable to accommodate a force of this sizewithin the Treaty areas prescribed for land forces.     From this positionthey could control the bridges over the Canal and the supply of black oil to Cairo.    Their lines of communication, and their eventual line of evacuation, would be through Port Said.    The project of a defendedperimeter near Suez, which was mentioned in the Cabinefs discussion on28th January, has been abandoned - partly for legal reasons (it is very far from the Treaty areas for land forces) but mainly because there isno accommodation for such large numbers near Suez and it would not be justifiable to build it now.3.        On the military aspects of this plan, we think it right to direct the Cabinefs attention to the following points, which are raised in thereport by the Chiefs of Staff: -(i)  This plan for winding up the Base could not be carried outsuccessfully without active Egyptian co-operation, including theirguarantee of security of access to our forces throughout.    If guerillaactivities increase in the Canal Zone, we shall not be able to salvagevery much from the Base, and the situation of our troops in the Zonewill become increasingly uncomfortable as their numbers drop.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No.C.(54) 459TH FEBRUARY, 1954 CABINET office record copy cabinet
I So(ii)  When the Base had been evacuated or abandoned, there wouldbe no military purpose in maintaining a force of 12,000 in the Canal Zone.And, as the numbers dropped to that figure, the possibility of hostileEgyptian action would increase.    The Cabinet will therefore wish toconsider whether this plan would leave the 12s000 in serious jeopardy.On this the Chiefs of Staff say that, if our remaining troops were attacked by the Egyptian Army, they could hold their own until reinforced, providedthat they had air support and that their communications could be re-opened in time.(iii)  This disposition of our forces would not suffice to secure theright of free passage through the Suez Canal.    But, with a force of this size, there is no way in which we could be certain of securing this ifEgypt wished to obstruct it.    The Minister of Transport will, however,consider, in consultation with the Chiefs of Staff and in confidential discussions with the Government^ representatives on the Council of the canal, whether there are any means by which vital installations on the canal can be protected against the risk of sabotage.4,        On the legal aspects our views are as follows.Before the outbreak of the war the United Kingdom was entitled under the Treaty to maintain a specified number of troops within specifiedareas in the Canal Zone.     For their part, the Egyptians undertook tocarry out specific obligations in respect of the provision of roads, etc,which they have not in fact fulfilled.    During the war the number ofBritish troops and the areas in which they were stationed were increasedfar beyond the limits prescribed in the Treaty for peace-time conditions.But this could be justified either by Article 7 of the Treaty or by the factthat the Egyptian Government had invited or at least acquiesced in it.After the war we continued to maintain troops in excess of the Treatylimits both as regards numbers and as regards the area in which theywere stationed, but the Egyptians did not make any formal complaint onthis score, as they might have done.    In 1947, however, they did take usto the Security Council, asking it to direct total and immediate evacuation of British troops from Egypt on the ground that the 1936 Treaty no longerbound Egypt, having outlived its purposes and being inconsistent with the charter.    The Security Council did not reach any conclusion.    It wasnot until October, 1951, that the Egyptians formally denounced the Treaty,thus putting themselves legally in the wrong.    Up to 1951 we weretechnically in breach.    Although Egypt continued to negotiate with us, itis obviously arguable whether that could be said to amount to acquiescence in such technical breaches.    But after the Egyptian denunciation, and perhaps to some extent before it, it is arguable that we were entitled under the doctrine of &quot;self-help&quot; to maintain forces sufficient to ensurethe security of the forces prescribed by the Treaty, particularly as theywere subject to constant threats of violence by the Egyptians and even to physical attacks.5.        It may be that an international tribunal would not find these arguments convincing.    But we shall not need to rely only on these if weannounce that we are in the process of evacuating the Base and reducing our troops to the numbers prescribed in the Treaty and if we ensure thatall our actions are henceforward seen to be directed towards this end.We are clearly entitled to take a reasonable time to withdraw;  we arealso entitled during this period to safeguard the security of our troops.This legal position would be strong and would appeal to the United states in particular and world opinion in general.2-
SIMONDSLord Chancellor^ Department, S. W. 1.9TH FEBRUARY, 1954.6.        We are agreed that under international law the Treaty subsistsat least until the end of 1956 when it is due for revision.    The questionwhether we could justify in law the positions occupied by our troopsremaining in Egypt in 1956 depends on the circumstances at that time.We cannot forecast them now.    But it is not necessary for us to announcenow the precise positions which we expect to be occupying in 1956.And,if the legality of our position is challenged in the meantime, we shallbe on strong ground if we can show that the object of our policy is to get back towards the Treaty limits.
REDUCTION OF BRITISH FORCES IN the canal ZONEReport by the Chiefs of StaffIn accordance with your instructions, we submit afterconsultation with the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, an outline plan for reduction of the British forces in the Canal Zone to Treaty limits,and their withdrawal within the Treaty area, to be completed within twoyears;  and our comments on the plan and its implications.    A relevantmap is at Annex.Possible Egyptian Courses of Action2.        The problem depends largely upon how the Egyptians react.The view of the Commanders-in-Chief, with which we agree, is thatimmediately negotiations are broken off, guerilla attacks and non-co-operation will increase considerably unless we have announced our intention to evacuate;  and that the Egyptians will certainly cut off ourlabour and deny us all the necessities of life that they can.    Under theconditions of Course (c) suggested by the Foreign Secretary, we agreewith the Ambassador that a declaration, which refers prominently to ourrights under the 1936 Treaty, would push the Egyptian Governmentstrongly towards stepping up guerilla activities and denying us essentialfacilities.    We consider that we mu t be prepared to meet that situation at any time.    We have, however, assumed that;-(a) Egypt would not try to deny the use of the suez Canal either by us or by the shipping of other nations.(b) The Egyptian armed forces would not takeovert hostile action against us.We realise that in the event, and as our strength decreases,these latter assumptions may prove to be false.The 1936 Treaty3,        There are a number of factors which make strict adherence tothe letter of the 1936 Treaty impracticable.    The most significant axe;-(a) The Treaty areas for the Army are very small andnot suitable for defence.(b) The accommodation which Egypt undertook underthe Treaty to provide for the Army in the Treatyareas has never been provided.    The troopsremaining, if confined strictly to the Treatyareas, could only be accommodated underausterity conditions.
Problem of Liquidating the Base4.        In order to liquidate the Base over half a million tons of stores and equipment, plus some 11,000 vehicles and 1,000 rolling stock,including locomotives would have to be shipped out in addition to unitbaggage and personnel.    We cannot remove our property without the useof Egyptian railways and ports.    If the Egyptians refused to co-operatewe would be compelled to provide the railway and port operating personnel and equipment required from this country, an enormous undertaking, ordestroy or abandon the bulk of the contents of the Base.The Plan of the Commanders-in-Chief,Middle East5.        In the view of the Commanders-in-Chief, whatever locality ischosen for the forces remaining after withdrawal to the Treaty area, itis essential that we should have adequate transportation facilities into and through PORT SAID for the evacuation of stores from the Base, for thev/withdrawal and re-deployment of our forces, for the import of supplies,for the maintenance of the forces remaining, for possible reinforcement,and for eventual withdrawal if this was decided upon.6.        If compelled to carry out this plan the Commanders-in-Chiefwould propose to clear Tel El Kebir first, which they consider would permit them to withdraw one brigade to Cyprus where it would be avail-able as a first reinforcement.    They suggest that this would make itobvious to the Egyptians at an early stage that we were taking active stepsto withdraw within Treaty limits.    They would then propose to roll up from the south into an area containing 10,000 land forces and some,000 R,A.F. personnel.7.        The Commanders-in-Chief consider that the final area to beheld must be capable of defence and contain port facilities, oil storage,water and at least one first class airfield.    There is no one localitywithin the Canal Zone which satisfies all these requirements, but in theview of the Commanders-in-Chief, the most practicable area is that ofMoas car/Abu-Sue ir.    They point out that control of this area would give us the advantage of being able to dominate the bridges over the suez canal and to retain some control over the black oil supplies of Cairo.Comments on the &quot;-lan of the Commanders-in-Chief8.        We consider that we should be taking an unwarranted risk ifcombatant troops were withdrawn until the evacuation of the Base was virtually completed.    We cannot therefore agree to the automatic with-drawal of one brigade to Cyprus consequent upon the evacuation ofTel El Kebir.    We must show that we mean business and are determinedand able to carry our plan through in our own way and in our own time.9.        We agree that the forces remaining must be based on a smallperimeter, in which its ammunition and supplies, say one month&apos;smaintenance, will be stored, and which must contain a first class airfield.It is essential, however, that the forces remaining should not be tied tothe defence of a perimeter, but should be mobile and capable of takinglimited offensive action.
10.      We appreciate that Port Said has great advantages over Suezfrom the transportation and reinforcement aspect.    An area roundGeneifa with communications through Suez might be tactically easier forthe land force to defend than the Moascar/Abu-Sueir area.    It would havethe serious disadvantage, however, of forcing us to use the round-Africaroute for evacuation, maintenance and reinforcement.    This aspect ofthe problem requires further detailed examination, in conjunction with the commanders-in-Chief.    Whichever area is selected, security of accessfrom the ports to the area retained is absolutely essential, otherwise our forces will be placed in a completely untenable position.Military Implications11.      Irrespective   of the area selected for the perimeter, the majormilitary implications would be as follows:-(a) After the first withdrawal of fighting troopsit would no longer be possible to contemplateoperations in the Delta.(b) At any stage during the withdrawal operation, theremaining garrison might have to be reinforced,probably by air, to ensure its safety or thesecurity of its communications;  the existingre-deployment plan would have to be revised to permit this.(c) The ability of the R.A.F. to support the land forces would be gradually reduced as airfields wereevacuated.    When finally they were restricted to the use of at most two airfields susceptibleas they would be to enemy artillery fire, the smallremaining local air forces would have to be supported by outside resources, such as cyprus and possibly aircraft carriers.    We could not be certain of being able to bring in reinforcementsor supplies by air lift.(d) On completion of the plan, there would be left a force of one division less one brigade group,with some armour.    If attacked by the Egyptianarmed forces, this force should be capable of holding its own until it could be reinforced, alwaysprovided it was assured of effective air action insupport and that its communications could be re-opened in time.    It would not be able to ensurepassage of the Suez Canal, nor to protect Britishinterests in Egypt.    It would be fulfilling no useful military purpose.
Conclusions12.      Our conclusions are that:-(a) The plan could only be successfully carried outwith active Egyptian co-operation, including their guarantee of security of access to our forces throughout.(b) The Egyptians are far more likely to be un-co-operative and to increase guerilla action and administrative measures against us.If they do so, it would be necessary at once to authorise the Commanders-in-Chief totake some or all of the &quot;essential military measures to maintain our position in Egypt&quot;detailed in Annex to D. (53) 25 of 21st April, 1953.(c) As our combat strength in the Canal Zone decreased,the threat of Egyptian hostile action must increase.At all times we must be able to reinforce our forces in the Canal Zone rapidly, and on a large scale.(d) There is no military object in retaining a forcein the Canal Zone after the Base has been evacuated.    If, however, its retention isnecessary for political reasons, it must beaccepted that, should the Egyptians attack the force or attempt seriously to interruptits communications, either by overt or covertmeans, the only effective sanction would be to deploy all the forces available to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment against the Egyptian Government,i. e. to go to war with Egypt and force her tobend to our will.(Signed)  J.
