* /SECRET .      ^ .   ^Copy No.,C. (54) 3 .;R CO-R&apos;D COPY5th January, 1954CABINETPERSIAN OILMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe brief with which Her Majesty&apos;s Charge cTAffaires at Tehran, Mr. Wright,,was provided set out a line of argument which had as its objective a direct settle-ment between the Persian Government and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company,(A.I.O.C.); that, from the point of view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, would bethe most satisfactory outcome. In any case, Her Majesty&apos;s Government requiredto be able to form their own judgment of the chances of such a solution, and thatjudgment would be based to some extent upon the Persian Government^ response to such a line of argument.2. All earlier indications, however, had been that a direct settlement betweenthe Persian Government and the A.I.O.C. could not be achieved. Recognising,this, the Company recently invited representatives of other companies with majoroil interests in the Middle East to join them in discussions, on a hypothetical basis^about the problems that would arise when Persian oil should again flow into itstraditional markets. The companies represented at these exploratory talks wereShell, the five major American oil companies and the Compagnie Francaise desPetroles, Mr. Hoover, Oil Adviser to the United States State Department, was present., 3. The upshot of the talks was that it would probably be feasible to forma group of companies to go into Persia on the following basis:  (a) the A.I.O.C. would have a share as close to 50 per cent, as the Persianscould be brought to accept;(b) the other companies, including Shell (half British) would buy their interestin the group, paying the A.I.O.C. either in capital, in revenue or with free oil;(c) Persia would pay the A.I.O.C. compensation for that part of the Value oftheir concession that was not covered by the purchase considerationmentioned at (b) above, such payment probably faking the form of free oil;(d) the representatives of the group would negotiate an agreement with thePersian Government to manage production and marketing on termssimilar to other Middle East oil agreements; and(e) satisfactory arrangements would be made in regard to the currency in whichpayments were made to the Persians.4. There was also some discussion about the part that the International Bankmight play in an oil settlement. The attitude of the American companies towards this was that the Bank might well play the part of intermediary in the early stages of negotiation, should the Persian attitude make this necessary; but the americans were not anxious that the Bank should play a permanent part in the Persian oil industry.5. Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires has now reported that he has begun to speak to his brief in regard to the A.I.O.C. The Persian Foreign Minister,Mr. Entezam, replied that he was certain that public opinion in Persia would not tolerate the return of the Company, and that any attempt by the Persian Govern-ment to bring it back would greatly embarrass them and Anglo-Persian relations.Mr. Entezam went on to say that he fully accepted the importance of our principlesthat the A.I.O.C. should receive compensation and that Persia could not expect to-do better out of her oil than her neighbours out of theirs. He then said that although45447: : &apos; Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1954 1
the Persian Government had not yet made up their minds,they were thinking along the lines of a solution whereby:  (i) the marketing of oil would be done by a consortium of foreign companies,    .       in which no single company should have a predominant share;(ii) the extraction and refining of oil would be carried out by a Persiancompany, with some foreign assistance; and(iii) the International Bank might act in some way as an intermediary, since this might make any solution more acceptable to Persian public opinion.6. The above represents only a first exchange of views and Mr. Wright is&quot;hoping shortly to talk with the Persian Prime Minister himself. But it seemsimprobable that the Prime Ministers attitude towards the a.I.O.C. will differ fromthat of his Minister for Foreign Affairs or that either can be persuaded to modify their views. We may therefore expect Mr. Wright shortly to advise us that thereis no hope of the a.I.O.C.&apos;s returning to Persia alone. Although the company havehitherto been loth to accept this, I think it likely that they may in fact prefer to; share with others the risks of returning to Persia.7. Meanwhile, we should not allow Persian ideas to harden;, and there is another important time factor, in that the emergency aid granted by the UnitedStates Government to Persia is rapidly running out. We cannot at this stageformulate a precise plan for a multi-national solution, since such a plan can onlybe the result of further and more definite talks between the oil companies. Itseems certain, however, that those companies will insist on effective control ofextraction and refining as well as of marketing.8. As to the method of negotiating such a multi-national solution with thePersian Government, it would be difficult for Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires,, evenin collaboration with the United States Ambassador and Mr. Hoover, to negotiateso complicated and technical an affair on behalf of a multi-national consortiumwhich includes French and Dutch, besides British and American, interests. On theother hand, there is the danger that the American companies in direct negotiations might seek to push the Persians too hard or farther than we and the United StatesGovernment should think wise towards accepting foreign control of the persian oil industry; and the more parties there are to the Western side of the negotia-tions, the greater the risk that the Persians would succeed in driving wedges betweenthem. To my mind, a decision whether to negotiate on the governmental or business level can only be taken after careful discussion with the United StatesGovernment.9. I accordingly recommend that, if Mr. Wright shortly confirms (as I fearhe will) that the Persian Government are unalterably opposed to the return of theA.I.O.C.:-(a) We should adopt &amp;- policy of working towards a, multi-national consortiumof oil interests as set out. at paragraph 3. above; with some form of participation by the International Bank if the United States Governmentand the companies themselves agree that it is desirable.(b) We should consult with the a.I.O.C. and invite them, on the assumptionthat they accept the position that a direct settlement between them andthe Persian Government cannot be achieved, to co-operate in this policyand for that purpose to resume forthwith their discussions with theother oil companies.- ;   ic) The United States Government should be informed of the position.id) Once the discussions in (b) were on the point of resumption, we should authorise Mi-. Wright to tell the Persian Government that Her Majesty&apos;s&apos; Government had noted their inclination towards a solution based on a multi-national consortium and that in fact discussions between thea.I.O.C. and other oil companies were now being resumed in order to, discover whether such a consortium could be formed.&apos; (e) We should (simultaneously with, (d) above) consult the United StatesGovernment about the best method of negotiation-whether itshould be governmental or by representatives of the prospectiveconsortium, perhaps With governmental observers present and in consul-tation with the Governments concerned.if) Mr. Wright would then be instructed to inform the Persian Government. of the outcome of (e);; : &apos;&apos;&apos;       ,a. e.Foreign Office, S.W.1,4 th January, 1954.
