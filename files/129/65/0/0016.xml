Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1954Copy No.   f jCABINETCRICHEL DOWNMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh AffairsIntroductionThe Cabinet, at their meeting on 29th December, 1953 (C.C. (53) 81st Conclu-sions, Minute 6), invited the Committee over which I have been presiding, withthe addition of the Lord Chancellor, &quot; to continue their investigation both of thepolicy governing the disposal of land compulsorily acquired for public purposes and the extent to which advantage could properly be taken of the doctrine of Crown Privilege in the forthcoming Crichel Down Enquiry and to submit theirfindings and recommendations to the Cabinet before Parliament reassembles.&quot; our colleagues on the Committee have been the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Agriculture and the LawOfficers.  I now report on the Committee&apos;s behalf as follows:   -A. Disposal of Land Purchased Compulsorily for Public purposes the problem. The question for consideration has been how far a former owner of land aquired compulsorily or under threat of compulsion by a Government Depart-ment for a particular purpose should be provided with ah opportunity of buyingback his land when it is no longer required by the Department which acquired it.This question has been investigated in detail by the Land Transactions Committee,which comprises officials of all the Departments concerned under Treasury chair-manship, and the recommendations submitted in this memorandum are based upon that Committee&apos;s report and have been framed in consultation with the Ministerswhose Departments are most directly concerned. . -Pre-emptive Right and Administrative Practice3. Former owners might be provided with an opportunity of recovering theifland either by the creation of a statutory right of pre-emption or simply throughadministrative practice. Pre-emptive rights have in the past been very limited in scope; and, because of the practical difficulties which they present, general policyover a number of years has been against granting them. The Committee saw no reason for reversing, this policy and accordingly recommend unanimously thatho statutory right of pre-emption should be granted to formers owners; of land inthe circumstances now; under consideration. -:,.,4. . It.follows that whatever opportunity of recovery it is desired to accord to former owners must&quot;- be provided through administrative practice, * and, in the immediately succeeding paragraphs of this memorandum, suggestions are made asto the nature of the opportunity which might be so provided in the various categories of case. The Lord Chancellor urged upon the Committee, however, the desirabilityof exercising all due caution in announcing even what is intended to be no morethan normal administrative practice in this matter in the future and of. making itclearly subject to the proviso that departure from what is to be the, normal admini-strative practice may be unavoidable in particular cases.45508SECRETC, (54) 16 v15th January; 1954
The Case of &quot;Sites&quot;; 5. &quot;Sites&quot; is the term used 16 denote land with buildings (other thanagricultural buildings) upon it. Disposal of &quot; sites &quot; is at present governed by whatis known as the Redundant Land and Accommodation procedure. Under this procedure Departments notify &quot;sites&quot; no longer required to the Ministry ofWorks, which circulates their particulars to other Government departments. If. no-department asks for a property within a stipulated time the holding department is free to dispose of it and normally does so by means of a sale to which fullpublicity is accorded, thereby providing the former owner with an opportunity of re-purchase. It is the normal practice, at least of the Ministry of Works, to notifyformer owners of such prospective sales where this appears appropriate and is practicable. The Committee agreed to recommend that this procedure for thedisposal of unwanted &quot; sites &quot; should continue to operate.The Case of Agricultural Land6. Agricultural land (including bombing ranges and grass airfields) whichhas been acquired by a Government Department is frequently handed over to theAgricultural Departments when no longer needed. In England and Wales such&apos; land is usually placed under the control of the Agricultural Land Commissionand let by them to suitable tenants after the carrying out of any necessary recon-reconditioning or re-equipment. It has been the intention of the Minister of agriculture to reverse this policy of retaining such land in Government ownership and disposalof agricultural land by Government Departments may now be expected to takeplace on an increasing scale.7. It was the general View of the Committee, and of the majority of theMinisters directly concerned, that administrative arrangements should be madeinj all future cases to ensure that where agricultural land (a) has been acquired by a Government Department possessing compulsory. purchase powers at the time of purchase (whether by the actual useof compulsion or not but not by purchase at a public auction),(b) has not been developed while in Government ownership,(c) is no longer required by the original acquiring Department or immediately by any other Government Department possessing compulsory purchasepowers for a purpose for which the use of these powers would bejustified, -the former owner of, or successor in title to the whole or part of the land, if hecan be traced without undue difficulty, should be notified that it is proposed tosell the land (subject to any necessary restrictions) and be given an opportunityof purchasing it in competition with other prospective purchasers. The Committeewere inclined to the view that sales should take place by public auction or publictender, with a preference for the former method as tending to put it beyond doubtthat the disposal had been conducted on a completely fair basis.8. The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agricultureconsider that a former, owner has a strong moral claim to recovery of his land which would not be adequately met by ensuring that, so far as possible, he had an equal opportunity, with others to.bid for the land but would only be satisfied byaccording hini, by administrative means and subject to necessary safeguards,, anopportunity of &quot; first refusal &quot; of the land. The Minister of Agriculture recognised,in paragraph 13 of his memorandum HA. (53) 137, that the price at which theland would be offered back to the previous owner in such circumstances must notonly cover its present market value but take account of any advantage which would accrue to the estate as a whole by reason of recovery of the land. He further suggested that, if it should not prove possible to reach agreement on the valuation of the land, the&apos; matter would have to be referred to the Lands Tribunal for arbitration. , The general view of the Committee, however, was that such anarrangement if it were to be of real value to the former owner, would in practicetend to accord him a financial advantage to which he was not entitled and would,for all practical purposes, be closely akin to a pre-emptive right. There would,moreoverj,: be likely to be pressure for such an. arrangement to be put upon a statutory basis. UThe iCqmmittee,- therefore, did not find it possible to endorse theproposal that former owners should be accorded an opportunity of a.&quot; first refusal.&quot;i &apos;9.  The Committee generally were further agreed that any amended practice -which it might be decided to adopt in regard to the disposal&apos;by&apos;the Governmentof agricultural land in the future could not be applied retrospectively in the-case of
Crichel Down or elsewhere. The Minister of Agriculture recognises, the formidabledifficulties in the way of applying any revised procedure to the Crichel Down caseat this stage but considers it regrettable that Commander Marten, should be ableto derive no advantage from the change in Government practice which will havebeen brought about in part as a result of his representations. The Secretary of Statefor Scotland is of the opinion that no decision should be taken on the question of.retrospective application of any amended practice in this matter until after the reportof the public enquiry into the Crichel Down case has been received and examined.&apos;   10.   The Minister of Agriculture is anxious that any change in Governmentpractice in regard to the disposal of agricultural land should be announced at anearly date.   The general view of the Committee was in favour of. such an:announcement.The Case of Airfields11. Airfields present a special problem because former boundaries have beenobliterated, buildings and runways have been constructed and the land could rarelyagain be farmed in its original parcels. In many cases, moreover, the Air ministry have reserved the right to re-occupy in an emergency and the suitability of the area for flying is being preserved. For these reasons it has been found desirable thatairfields should be dealt with by a special inter-departmental committee. TheCommittee agreed to recommend that no change should be made in the existing arrangements in regard to their disposal.Public Authorities12. The Committee also agreed that no attempt should be made to alter thepresent practice of local authorities in the disposal of land compulsorily acquired,It was their provisional view that, in the case of the nationalised industries, if itwere to come to the knowledge of the responsible Minister that a nationalised industry was not handling the disposal of agricultural land compulsorily acquiredon the lines which the Government now contemplated following, the Minister wouldhave to consider whether there was a case for his using his powers of direction.B. Crichel Down EnquiryThe Problem J ;13. The main practical question for consideration has been whether and, if so, what further official documents, apart from the inter-departmental correspon-dence already disclosed, should be made available to Sir&quot; Andrew Clark, Q.C.,who is conducting the Enquiry, and when any further such disclosure should bemade. On this aspect of the matter the views of the Treasury Solicitor and ofMr. Charles Russell, Q.C., who has been retained as Counsel for the Minister ofAgriculture at the Enquiry, have been obtained and taken into account in framing the recommendations made in this memorandum. &quot;.&apos;...Crown Privilege14. The Committee agreed unanimously to recommend that full disclosure of official documents should be made to Sir Andrew Clark, who should decide, on grounds of relevance and not Crown Privilege, what additional documents shouldbe made available for the purpose of the Enquiry. Such full disclosure appearedto the Committee to be not only inevitable, having regard to the Enquiry&apos;?: wideterms of reference (see C. (53) 361, paragraph 2), but also unlikely to create a seriousprecedent so far at least as the issue of Crown Privilege in legal proceedings is.concerned. Such proceedings can in the Committee&apos;s view be clearly distinguished from public enquiries. As regards public enquiries, the Committee recognised that full disclosure in the Crichel Down case would increase the heed for caution whenthe appointment of similar public, enquiries is under consideration in future andmight well give rise to a demand in Parliament for some form of undertaking inregard to disclosure at all future public enquiries which, would.have to be duly;considered if it were made. :      \ 1.  \&apos;. 1.5..  The Committee further agreed that, if full disclosure is to be made as they recommend, it should be made;in advance of the hearing and,-indeed; withoutfurther delay: on the ground that the Ministry might be put in an embarrassing;position if, after the expiry.of the three months&apos; adjournn^entwbich hasrnow:beengranted, they were, still not clear as. to...what,.further d.Qcturie.nts, if any, they/should disclose.    . &apos;. . -   . - icrhyii rv:&apos;&quot;i.-- .;/;V fim??;; yc      ;.;
16. The Committee were given to understand that.the additional documentslikely to be disclosed if their recommendation is accepted are the Whitehall filesof the Ministry of Agriculture and similar files of the Crown Lands commissioners and that, on balance, disclosure of these files would be likely to strengthen the case for the action taken by the Ministry and the Commissioners rather than the reverse.Approach to the Enquiry17. The Committee also considered whether it was open to the1 Ministerto take any action with a view to the withdrawal, or at least theolimitation of; thescope, of the Enquiry and whether, apart from any possible action with these objects, it might be possible to secure some narrowing of the scope of the enquiry in practice by agreement with Commander Marten who is understood now to besatisfied that at least there was no malpractice on the part of officials. The general view of the Committee, however, was that the Minister would be ill-advised totake any initiative in these directions.18. Finally, the Committee agreed to recommend that Mr. Charles Russell,should be instructed that his general approach to the Enquiry should be on thelines that lie was appearing on behalf of the Minister of Agriculture but was desired by the Minister to assist the conduct of the Enquiry in every possible way. TheCommittee considered that it would be right that Mr. Russell should put his cardson the table and not attempt to defend those actions of officials, revealed inthe documents already disclosed or to be disclosed, which were clearly indefensible.Summary of Recommendations19. On behalf of the Committee over which i presided I invite the Cabinetto agree:  A.   Disposal of Land Purchased Compulsorily for Public Purposes(1) That no statutory right of pre-emption should be given to the owners ofland acquired compulsorily or under threat of compulsion.(2) That, in the case of &quot; sites &quot; (i.e., land with buildings on it) no longer. required by the department which acquired them, the Redundant land and Accommodation procedure (explained in paragraph 5 above) shouldcontinue to operate.(3) That, in the case of agricultural land (including land with agriculturalbuildings upon it), it should be announced at an early date that adminis-- tratiye arrangements&quot; of the kind outlined in paragraph 7 above will operate in future but that these arrangements will not be appliedretrospectively.(4) That the existing procedure in regard to the disposal of airfields should be;   adhered to. .(5) That the practice of local authorities in regard to land compulsorily acquired should remain unaffected, but that consideration should begiven to the possible application of the arrangements recommended in(3) above to nationalised industries and possibly other public authorities.B. Crichel Down Enquiry(6) That full disclosure of official documents should be made forthwith toSir Andrew Clark, Q.C., who should decide on grounds of relevance andnot Crown Privilege what additional documents should be madeavailable for the purpose of the Enquiry. ,(7) That the Minister of Agriculture should take no initiative towards securing a withdrawal of the Enquiry or limitation of its terms of reference or thev:; restriction of its scope in practice.,i[j   (8) That the Minister of Agriculture should arrange for Mr.  CharlesRussell, Q.C., to be instructed that his general approach to the enquiry should be on the lines that he is appearing on behalf of the Minister who: , .;; -desires; him [to assist the conduct of the Enquiry in every possible way:^2%^ &apos; -        D.
