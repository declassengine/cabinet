Printed for the. Cabinet.   January 1954SECRETC. (54) 67th January, 1954CABINETMIDDLE EAST policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at the Cabinet meeting on 29th December (C.C. (53) 81st Conclusions,Minute 1), I proposed to circulate a memorandum on our policy in regard to Egypt,explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the various courses now open. Ihave in this paper endeavoured to do so; the Chiefs of Staff are, I understand,preparing another memorandum showing the military picture.Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations2.   We entered into negotiation with the Egyptian Government in order:  (i) to obtain an agreement which would provide for the satisfactory main-tenance of the Suez Canal Base and give us the right of re-entry in war.The Chiefs of Staff consider that wherever we deploy our Middle Eastforces in peace-time, a base in the Canal Zone area and access throughSuez and Port Said are of great value for the support of forces in theMiddle East in war;(ii) to settle the dispute arising out of the Egyptian purported abrogation ofthe Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the presence of British forces in the canal Zone;(iii) to try to associate Egypt, and with her the other Arab States, with theWest in arrangements for the defence of the Middle East against outsideaggression.3. Since the negotiations started, the situation has changed. We are not nowexpecting war with the Soviet Union in the immediate future. Therefore theproblem confronting us is largely that of meeting our peace-time commitments,while we must retain a right to such facilities as we may need in war. (Both our peace-time and war-time requirements are set out in more detail in the memorandumon the military picture.)4. Whatever the manner of settlement, the Egyptian question cannot be con-sidered in isolation from our relations with the other Arab States. A satisfactory settlement would improve our relations with them and create a better atmospherefor discussion of our future strategic requirements in these countries. It would help us to secure in war-time the Eastern flank of the North Atlantic Alliance. In thepresent cold war situation, it is through a settlement with Egypt that we could bestsecure our interests in the area, including our oil interests and the use of the suez canal, and assist in ensuring the stability of the area, thus preventing the spread of communism or neutralism.Reduction of Forces5. My colleagues will be aware that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked for a saving of  180 millions on our defence expenditure by 1955-56, andthat efforts are being made to secure substantial economies in the man-power required for the Services. Examination of our main military commitments overseashas led to the conclusion that the bulk of the reduction must come either from45465O i&quot; fCABIN!:RECORD copy copy No.
Germany or the Middle East. Any substantial reduction in Germany would havea disastrous effect on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation .and deal a fatal blow to the European Defence Community. A treaty with Egypt, accompanied by aredeployment which would show that we have no intention of abandoning our interests in the Middle East, While it would release some of our forces, need notdiminish our influence. It is clear that, if substantial cuts are to be made, the middle east is the least dangerous theatre in which to make them.Courses if We Fail to Reach Agreement6.  If we fail to obtain an agreement with Egypt, three courses remain open:  (a) to stay on indefinitely in the Canal Zone despite Egyptian hostility andattempts to remove us by international action;(b) to announce that we shall liquidate the base, evacuate the Canal Zone anddeploy elsewhere in the Middle East the forces which we consider necessary, making it clear that we will do so in our own time, butaiming to complete the operation by December 1956;(c) to state that:the maintenance of the present base is impossible in view of failure to reach agreement with the Egyptians and their present attitude, therefore we intend to alter our arrangements in theMiddle East and to wind up this base; that will take two or threeyears to do; the less the Egyptians interfere with the process the shorter time it will take;(ii) the removal of the base will not deprive us of our rights under the1936 Treaty;(iii) so far as our future relations with Egypt in war are concerned weare prepared for revision of the 1936 Treaty according to its terms: as it is clear that agreement on that revision with the egyptians will be impossible, we are prepared to go to arbitrationupon the terms of such revision in accordance with the Treaty;(iv) as regards the defence of the Canal (and &quot;the liberty and entiresecurity of navigation &quot;-) and the stationing of British troops inpeace-time in the vicinity of the Canal under Article 8 of theTreaty, as agreement with the Egyptians upon this will also beimpossible we are prepared to go to arbitration upon it inaccordance with the terms of the Treaty;(v) if the Egyptian Government agree, Her Majesty&apos;s Government areprepared to enter into immediate discussions with them with aview t-o submitting these issues to arbitration.7. If we choose alternative (a) we should have to maintain our position againstgrowing Egyptian hostility. We should have to face, in addition to this opposition,dangerous international repercussions. The Egyptians might invoke international action and we might have to ignore the resulting decision. There would be no possibility of effecting economies or a reduction in our Middle East forces, and weshould probably end up by having to increase them. There would be a furtherprogressive deterioration of the base.8. Course ib) has the serious disadvantage that we abandon our position inEgypt without any provision for a base there. This would be a great disappoint-ment to our friends and allies and would be inconsistent with the emphasis whichwe have constantly placed in our public utterances on the value of the base. turkey would be concerned for the security of her Southern flank in war-time and might regard it as a sign of weakness in us. Australia, New Zealand and South Africawould be even more reluctant than they are at present to enter into definite com-commitments regarding the defence of the Middle East. Israel would be concerned,even more than she is at present, with the change in the balance of militaryadvantage as between herself and the Arab States. There would be a serious effect upon our prestige in the Middle East and our chances of obtaining facilities in other Arab countries. It would seem to me an almost impossible task to put up an effective defence of this course before British opinion.9. if course (ft) were to be adopted, we should at any rate require theco-operation of the Egyptians in maintaining.law and order and providing thenecessary labour and use of communications.   Lack of co-operation of this nature
would lead to greater expense and man-power and money and to heavy loss of stores. The evacuation would then be delayed and might become an undignifiedscramble.10. As regards (c), if the Egyptians accept arbitration, We shall have attainedour end and he able to redeploy, If they refuse, we may expect serious trouble, but our position will be easier to justify in the eyes of the world. The economies oouldhe effected under better conditions than under those of course (b). On the otherhand, it would mean a loss of the base in war and therefore the need to replaaaEntirely our defensive strategy. This could cause similar disappointment to our friends and allies to that caused by course (ft).Redeployment11. Our present plans, which involve primarily the co-operation of Iraq,Jordan and Libya, are based on the assumption that we shall reach an agreementWith Egypt. If we get no agreement and are forced to redeploy in the circum-stances of (ft) -our position with those States will be much weaker. It is forconsideration, therefore, whether we should not reverse or modify our policy ofbasing our defence plans-on Arab alliances and instead seek to develop co-operationwith Israel and Turkey. Both are more stable, militarily more efficient and haveexpressed readiness to co-operate in the defence of the area. Turkish co-operation would be compatible with further attempts at working with the Arabs.12. We sent an exploratory military mission to Israel in 1952. . This reportedthat the Israelis would welcome an exchange of information about defence plans and were willing *o concert with us m drawing up joint plans under which their  forces would co-operate with our own in war. They would also be ,glad to give us facilities for the pre-positioning of stores providing that we would make funds available for the development of port facilities and-communications in Israel, whichwould -be available for our use on the outbreak of war. They have not offered to accept the Stationing of British troops in Israel in peace, and would be unlikely to do so. Owing to the lack of funds for their development projects and to theneed to avoid antagonising the Arabs, we have not followed up these discussionspending the outcome of the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations. The disadvantages ofa policy of concentrating our resources on Israel would he:  (i) it would not serve the purpose in war of holding the North-East frontier of Iraq;(ii) it would alienate the Arab States, from whom we shall continue to wantfacilities and co-operation; this would be detrimental to our interests inthose States, including oil, and would increase the danger of theirtaking up a neutralist position;(iii) it would do little to assist us towards the fulfilment of our commitments inpeace;(iv) it is very unlikely that Israel forces could be used in the Arab countries*tl even in the face of a Soviet attack.For these reasons we must, I think, abandon any idea of basing our Middle east defence policy wholly or mainly on co-operation with Israel.13. From talks which have been held recently between representatives of middle East Land Forces and the Turkish staff about Middle East defence it appearsthat the Turks are in principle willing to offer us facilities for the pre-stocking of equipment at Mardin, should we request them. In return they will expect that weshould reveal to them our plans for the defence of North-East Iraq, in which theTurks are of course keenly interested in view of the dependence upon those plans of their own southern flank, and that we should definitely commit ourselves to the forward &quot; outer ring &quot; strategy. It is not clear whether or not they would be willingto accept the stationing of British troops in peacetime.14. Reports from Ankara show that it would have a very favourable effect upon Turkey if we were to proceed with the Mardin plan and the &quot; outer ring &quot;strategy. It would also have an excellent effect with regard to our difficulties inIraq,(i) by demonstrating to the Iraqis that we were in earnest about the defence oftheir country;
; (ii) by making us less dependent on the facilities in Iraq which we enjoy underthe Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and which are increasingly being called inquestion by the Iraqis.15. I am informed that redeployment to Gaza, which looks at first sightattractive since it would place British forces between Egypt and Israel, is imprac-ticable on military and financial grounds. There is no deep-water harbour,inadequate drinking water, and the Arab refugee population could not be adapted to provide the labour force needed. A scheme combining use of Gaza and theNegev, including the Israel port of Elath, must similarly be rejected. It wouldinvolve a large outlay of money on port facilities and communications.Conclusions16. (i) From the above considerations I have drawn the conclusion that our best course is to strive for an agreement with Egypt on our present terms. Ifwe do not succeed, we are in a bad position. We must either remain inthe Canal Zone indefinitely by force, a policy which, among other things, would not enable us to meet the Chancellor of the Exchequersdemands, or we must leave Egypt of our own volition. However we do this it will look more or less as if we are running away,(ii) If we fail to reach an agreement, I would prefer course (c) rather than (b)of the alternatives set out in paragraph 6 above. Course (c) would atleast be defensible to our friends and allies. Though it might wellinvolve difficulties with the Egyptians, our international position in ourdispute with Egypt would certainly be improved,(hi) Courses (a) and (b) would, and course (c) might, weaken our position withthe other Arab states.(iv) Obtaining facilities in Turkey is compatible with further attempts toco-operate with the Arab countries other than Egypt; in negotiating with iraq, for example, our hand would be strengthened if we could concludearrangements with Turkey for the use of facilities at Mardin. We should therefore try to do this.(v) Basing our defence arrangements on Israel would be incompatible with further attempts at Arab co-operation.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,6th January, 1954.
