Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1954SECRET CABINET CFFI01   Copy No.? 1C. (54) 31 RECORD COPY28th January, 1954CABINETTHE EUROPEAN DEFENCE community memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues the annexed record of a conversation in Berlin between my Principal Private Secretary and M. de Margerie,the Assistant Director of Political Affairs in the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.2. I do not suppose that M. Bidault would endorse the views expressed byM. de Margerie on this occasion, but they are characteristic of a certain school of French thought at the present time.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,27th January, 1954.ANNEXM. de Margerie spoke to me at lunch to-day about the prospects of Frenchratification of the E.D.C.He said that in his judgment there was no prospect at all of obtaining an effective majority for ratification of the Treaty in its present form. The FrenchParliament simply did not contain a majority for any &quot; positive &quot; measure of that kind; it only contained, by the combination of Left and Right, &quot; negative&quot;majorities capable of preventing things being done.M. de Margerie said that the French Government^ policy, of course, was to push ahead with the Treaty in its present form and they were not admitting any possibility of changing it. But in fact an increasing number of political leaders(and he mentioned M. Pinay, M. Lapie and General de Montsabert, a formerGaullist Deputy) were beginning to think that means must be found of presenting the E.D.C. to the French Parliament in a more acceptable form. When I asked if this meant emasculating the Treaty he said not exactly, but the idea was that some parts of it (and notably those which involved the disappearance of the French army as such) might be made subject to delay in application. In other words, a time-table might be introduced which enabled the French Parliament to approve the broad concept of the E.D.C. without committing themselves to immediate imple-mentation of the objectionable features. The difficulties, he admitted, were great and mainly two-fold:  (a) they must avoid having to send the Treaty back for re-negotiation by theother member countries;(b) they must not endanger the limitations on German rearmament already achieved by the present Treaty.I thought all this sounded very disquieting and told M. de Margerie that i thought it was vain to try and save the French Parliament from the responsibilityof taking clear-cut decisions on this matter. He was obviously very scepticalwhether they would do so.45585(Signed) C. A. E. SHUCKBURGH.
