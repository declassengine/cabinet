(54) 79r/z January, 1954CABINETATOMIC ENERGY-COMMONWEALTH CO-operation memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilIn C (53) 303 Lord Cherwell reported on his visit to Australia and the outcome of his discussions with Australian Ministers. Possible lines of action have been examined by officials and their conclusions are incorporated in what follows.2. The object of Lord CherwelFs visit was to follow up; the policy approvedby the Cabinet in April (CC (53) 28th Conclusions, Minute 5) and to seek anagreement with the Australian Government providing for an assured supply ofuranium from Australia to the United Kingdom and the placing of our technical information on the industrial use of atomic energy at the disposal of the australian government. &quot; &apos;Uranium Supplies &quot; &quot;3. Lord Cherwell was not able to secure any definite undertaking aboutsupplies of uranium. A number of factors contributed to this attitude on the partof the Australian Government: t v;,(a) There is much greater uncertainty than we had expected about the extent and prospects of uranium deposits outside the area already committed to the Combined Development Agency (CD.A.). Moreover, owingto physical difficulties, development will be slow and it will be someyears before any supplies are likely to become available. TheAustralian Government therefore took the view that, since if was Stillimpossible to assess what Australia^ uranium resources really are&quot;,&apos; itwas not yet possible for them to enter into firm commitments.(b) The Australian Government hope that private capital; if offered the induce-ment of a free market, will flow into uranium mining in vast amounts.Both Lord Cherwell and United Kingdom officials regard this as most unlikely in view of the heavy risks and very slow returns on capital invested in uranium mining. But it will take time; before practical experience convinces the Australians of this.(c) The press campaign against any further commitments of Australian uraniumresources made Australian Ministers very nervous of any agreement atthis stage.4. I am convinced that for the present we cannot hope to come to a firmagreement with the Australians over uranium supplies. They will not be willing totouch this (for them) delicate issue until after their Elections in July of next year.Even then it may be some time before they feel that knowledge of their resourceshas sufficiently advanced to enable them to come to firm agreements.45477
5. Although we have not secured the assured uranium supplies we sought,Lord Cherwell&apos;s visit was of considerable value. The Australians are fully aware of our interest in securing supplies outside those at present committed to the C.D.A.;and, although his Cabinet were very careful to make no promises, Mr. Menzieshas himself gone further and has expressed to us his personal intention that theUnited Kingdom shall be a preferred customer when an exportable surplus becomes available-which will not be for a few years. We may reasonably expect that the australians will give us priority over the Americans.Technical Co-operation with Australia6. We are faced with the question whether we should now go ahead andmeet the Australian request that we should release to them all the technical information and assistance they may need for their own industrial atomic energy work.7. On the one hand we had hoped to use an offer of the technical assistance as an inducement to the Australians to meet us over supplies. Moreover ourtechnical discoveries have cost us many millions and there is a natural reluctance to give them away free.8. On the other hand there are strong arguments in favour of going aheadnow on the technical side without any definite quid pro quo over supplies:  (a) The long-term advantages to us if we take the lead in Australia may bevery substantial indeed. There will be direct advantages in havingAustralian atomic energy developments based on United Kingdomequipment and methods. In the next generation or two atomic energyis likely to become an important, if not the main, source of electric power; from the broad economic, political and defence points of viewwe ought therefore to do what we can to link up Australia closely with ourselves.(b) If the Australians are effectively tied in with us on the technical side our prospects of securing uranium supplies when they become available willbe much enhanced.(c) If we withhold technical information the Americans may step in instead.There are already signs that they are planning to amend their legisla-tion so as to enable them to offer technical information to uranium-producing countries. The concept of the international exchange ofinformation on peaceful uses of atomic energy runs through president eisenhower&apos;s speech to the United Nations. The possibility of widerco-operation on these lines which may prove to be remote in time andis in any case uncertain should not, however, interfere with our plans for looking after our own interests in the Commonwealth.(cl) On the defence side the Australian Government has not so far expressedany direct interest in the manufacture of atomic weapons. But if andwhen Australia develops a power plant of her own, and if this plantwere constructed to run so as to produce military plutonium, thisplutonium would, in the view of the Chiefs of Staff, be a valuablestrategic source of supply for the United Kingdom. We shall continueto be dependent on Australian goodwill for facilities for testing ourown weapons if, as seems likely, a place near Emu Field proves to offer the only feasible Commonwealth site.South Africa9. The South African Government are also now seeking technical co-operation from the United Kingdom. The permanent head of their Mines Department was sent here last month on an exploratory mission at the personal instance, of theSouth African Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and Minister of Mines. TheSouth Africans are unlikely to have an atomic programme of their own for sometime. But South1 Africa will soon be, and is expected to remain for many years,the main supplier of uranium and in the long run will need to develop atomic energy for industrial uses. The South Africans are therefore anxious to make a start and to take the only practical step which is open to them at this time-thetraining of key personnel-in the very near future. Although they have no directquid pro quo which they could offer us now (all their uranium supplies are com-mitted to the C.D.A. up to 1964), it is clearly in our long-term interest to play in
with them and toencourage in every way their present desire to look to us for help.We should therefore follow up the South African initiative by offering to receiveSouth African technicians for training here.Approach to the Americans and Canadians10. We need to take action under the modus vivendi to obtain United Statesconcurrence for passing information of non-United States Origin to a Common-wealth country. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington has been consulted onthis and, while of course he cannot be categoric about American reactions, is confident that he will in fact be able so to handle matters as to secure Americanacceptance. The Canadians are likely to be well-disposed to our ideas.Recommendations.11.   Officials have recommended that:  (a) the United Kingdom Government should be ready to make technical information of non-United States origin available to Australia andSouth Africa according to the requirements of the latter countries, andthe Australian and South African Governments should be so informed that an early date;(b) Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington, should be authorised to clear the way with the Americans after the further exchange of communica-tions with Australia proposed in (d);(c) it would be fruitless to attempt at this stage to tie the Australians downabout uranium supplies, but we should put on record with them our understanding of discussions so far, develop a good atmosphere withthem and prepare the way for further discussions as soon as there isa favourable opportunity;id) to this end the first step would be to authorise the United Kingdom HighCommissioner, Canberra to make a communication as at Annex to the australians in such manner as he thinks appropriate; thereafter, andsubject to any reply from Australia, we should proceed forthwith to clear the way with the Americans and Canadians and then to arrangeexchanges of information with Australia and South Africa.12. I endorse these recommendations. It is a pity that we cannot yet expectassured supplies of uranium from Australia. But we should only court a rebuffif we pressed them further now. I am sure that we shall be well-advised to go ahead with technical co-operation with Australia and South Africa without seeking to impose bargaining conditions. To a large extent it will be a case of casting ourbread on the waters. But we are at the beginning of major developments on atomic energy and we have an opportunity to start a great Commonwealth effort in this field if we go forward with confidence.&apos;A. &apos; &apos; ;$ s.Office of the Lord President,2nd January, 1954.ANNEXInformal Communication to the Australian Government(It is intended that the precise manner in which this communication is made toAustralia should be left to the discretion of the United Kingdom High Com-missioner at Canberra.)We have received and studied a report from Lord Cherwell on his explanatory discussions with Australian Ministers.2.   We are glad to note the interest of the Australian Government in technical information about atomic energy for industrial use and in the question of uraniumbeing made available to meet the developing requirements of the United Kingdom,for our industrial atomic programme, , V&apos;-
3. The United Kingdom Government are very willing that their technical information in regard to all aspects of the industrial application of atomic energyshould be made available by them to the Government of Australia as may berequired by the progress of Australia^ atomic energy programme. This procedurewill include the exchange of scientific personnel and it is envisaged that, when thetime comes to build power reactors in Australia, we should, so far as our resourcespermit, assist with the design and operation of these plants and the supply ofspecial materials that may be required for them such as uranium fuel elementsand graphite. It is suggested that the scientific officers of the Australian atomic energy Commission should as necessary get into touch with their opposite numbers in this country in order to discuss and identify their requirements. It will benecessary for agreed arrangements to be made to ensure that appropriate securitysafeguards operate on a common basis in regard to classified information exchanged,and it is proposed that details should be discussed between the appropriate UnitedKingdom and Australian authorities at an early date.4. As the Australian authorities know, it is necessary for us to approach theUnited States Government before we can release classified information aboutatomic energy to Australia. The United Kingdom Government are prepared tomake such an approach at an early date and instructions will be issued to the UnitedKingdom Ambassador in Washington accordingly. It is, however, necessary thathe should be able to pick his time for making the approach and it is important that there should be no premature action which might hamper him in obtainingAmerican agreement.5. The Australian Government made it clear to Lord Cherwell that they areaJ present unable to enter into any precise assurances as to supplies of uraniumwhich might be made available to the United Kingdom outside those already com-mitted to the Combined Development Agency. We understand from Lord Cherwellthat the extent of these possible supplies is not yet known but that the australian government intend to use their best endeavours to establish knowledge of theiruranium resources in the shortest possible time. We appreciate that the australian government need to ensure that certain requirements can be met from Australianuranium supplies; the possible uranium supplies in which the United kingdom is interested may accordingly be expressed as those which are not required to. meet Australia^ own needs and are thus available for export, which are beyondthe contemplation of the Australian contract with the C.D.A., and which theAustralian Government will not be obliged, owing to considerations of overridingmilitary necessity, to make available for defence purposes. While we recognise thatthe Australian Government have entered into no commitments in regard to theuranium in which the United Kingdom is thus interested, it is our understandingthat they wish to make available to the United Kingdom as much uranium as theycan and, when the time comes for practical arrangements to deal with non-C.D.A.uranium supplies from Australia, the Australian Government will be prepared to consult further with the United Kingdom Government about the possibility of theUnited Kingdom having an option on uranium supplies as expressed above for pur-chase at some fair price to be agreed upon. We should be glad if detailed con-sideration of the necessary practical arrangements could be jointly undertakenWhenever the Australian Government feel that this would be convenient to them.We shall accordingly await suggestions as to this from the Australian Government.6. The United Kingdom Government are confident, in the light of LordCherwelFs report, that arrangements can progressively be made, which will be mutually advantageous to our two countries, both in the field of technical co-operation, and in regard to the development and supply of uranium. They believe: that, in the foregoing, they have recorded the present stage reached in the discussions on these subjects between the two Governments.
