Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1954SECRETCopy No.C. (54) 2221 st January, 1954CABINET office record COPYCABINETGOVERNMENT METHODS OF FINANCING AND effects on TAXATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and theMinister of MaterialsThe problems arising from taxation I believe to be more urgent and deep-seated than any others with which the Government is faced.2. I realise that a Royal Commission will report on some aspects of theproblem in due course, but in the long run the total measure of taxation depends on Government policy and the Royal Commission is not invited to report on that.3. In two years this Government has earned much credit for courageousdecisions on housing, rationing and the limitation of State monopoly trading.4. We cannot be content with a level of taxation which eats into the resourcesof every manufacturing industry in the country and of many private persons, andleaves a position in which the only way in which anyone can accumulate wealth,however hard they work, is by operations on the Stock Exchange.5. Whilst taxation is the primary responsibility of the Chancellor of theExchequer, it is also the responsibility of the Cabinet, and at the last meetingof the Cabinet before Mr. Butler went overseas he asked for the support of hiscolleagues.6. I do not see how we can make the reductions in taxation which our economy requires by departmental economies on staff. Policy determines expendi-ture. We succeeded in housing because we had a target. We now require a target for taxation. If enterprise and competitive trading and a high and stable level ofemployment is to be maintained in this country the general level of taxation mustbe reduced and the highest level should be 155. in the pound: that should be ourtarget.7. The prosperity of the country depends upon the initiative, and willingness to take risks, of a large number of limited companies and a comparatively small number of people of high capacity, many of whom already possess considerablegross incomes. They are the people who exploit inventions, open up new marketsoverseas and devise the means to increase production.8. All trade depends for its existence on its profitability. It really is of littleuse to make speeches urging the importance of wider commercial adventure inorder to improve our export trade, when taxation on profits is so high that com-mercial prudence leads people to resist the temptation to take financial risks. Solong as the Exchequer takes more than 50 per cent, of any extra profit the com-mercial firms may make, and \9s. in the pound of any extra income these industrialleaders may make, it is not reasonable to expect the fires of adventure to continueto burn very brightly.9.&apos; Furthermore, the present level of taxation is not only damping initiative and eating into our commercial reserves and resources, it is having a demoralisingeffect on the nation which the Government ought not to ignore.10. High salaries have lost most of their old attraction for ambitious men:instead people look for tax-free allowances, which fall inequitably on different sortsand places of employment, and which incidentally are a bad thing for the economicconduct of business.45538
11. Increases in wages are no longer subject to close analysis of what the tradecan stand, because well over half of such increases will, through reduced profits,go to the charge of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.- - 12. I would apologise to my colleagues for this long essay on the obvious,were it not that I am convinced that, unless we take courageous and fresh action,we shall let the nation drift into economic trouble, and, what is more to the point,I have a practical proposal to make as to one way in which we can begin to dealwith the problem.13. Our system of national finance has learned little from sound commercialpractice: it is based on the economic conditions of generations ago. We make no proper distinction between revenue and capital accounts. Social services andadministrative charges, however high they be, ought to be and are charged to revenue account: we pay for them, and benefit by them, as we go along. Butwe have other and totally different charges, the benefit of which does not accrue from day to day but is spread over a future period; these we also charge to revenue and meet from the current budget.14. One such item has already been raised by the Minister of Housing thecompensation payments under the new Town and Country Planning Bill. Anotherexample comes within my purview as Minister of Materials. As a matter of Govern-ment policy, we build up a strategic reserve of raw materials. As the Prime Ministerrightly pointed out to us, this merely means that we transfer our financial resourcesinto material resources, and provided we buy prudently no real cost to the nationis involved. But the amount that we put aside for this purpose is charged to thecurrent budget and is restricted accordingly.  Thereby we endanger our security.15. It seems to me that the sensible thing is to make the stockpile adequateat the earliest possible moment so that, if war comes, we shall have this provision;but we should adopt commercial practice for financing it. We should issue a short-term loan Of ten years, and the annual budget should meet only charges foramortisation, interest, and the cost of upkeep and depreciation of the items in thestockpile.16. Need we pay in these next few years for all the large road developmentthat has been delayed by the war: would it not suffice if we paid the cost and charges of a Road Loan amortised in 25 years?17. Is it necessary to inflict on a generation which has endured two majorWars, and still bears so much of their consequences, the additional burden of financing now (or forgoing for their successors) capital expenditure which willenure to the benefit of those successors?18. My suggestions mean some departure from traditional practice wherebyexpenditure which is irrecoverable or yields no revenue is made subject to scrutinyby Parliament through normal supply procedure. But the inclusion of annualamortisation payments in departmental Votes would provide an opportunity for parliamentary discussion, and Parliamentary control could be further assured onthe lines of the compromise proposal put forward by the Minister of Housingrecently in connection with the compensation payments.19. What I propose is wholly in keeping with sound commercial accountancy.Prudent industrial enterprises issue debentures to spread capital costs and repaythem.   Why should not Government finance be based on such accepted methods?20. But it is not on the narrow ground of accountancy practice that I ask forconsideration of this problem. I do so because it appears to me that the requirement that substantial blocks of capital expenditure (capital, that is, in the sense that itcreates tangible and enduring, or long-term, assets) should be met out of the proceeds of current taxation is compelling us to endanger the prosperity, strength,and well-being of this country, both by maintaining personal taxation at a level which is killing enterprise and by forgoing in whole or in part capital expenditurenecessary for the safety or well-being of the country.21. I submit this paper as indicating but one method of rendering the assist-ance the Chancellor asked from his colleagues, and I ask that the problem of reducing taxation shall occupy the minds and the deliberation of the Cabinet as one of major and urgent importance.Office of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, S.W. 1,18th January, 1954.
