CONFIDENTIALCopy No.C. (54) 499th February, 1954CABINETTHE ROYAL TOUR OF CEYLONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsWith reference to the Prime Minister^ Note of 5th February, C. (54) 39,about the proposed visit by The Queen to the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, Icirculate to my colleagues the attached note showing how the question has arisen.2. As will be seen, the only question which now arises is whether, whenvisiting the Temple, Her Majesty should remove her shoes. The Ceylon authoritieshave made it clear that this act would not be regarded in Ceylon as having anyreligious significance, but it,might give rise to misunderstanding in this country;though I think this could be avoided if it is suitably explained to the Press atthe time.3. There is no doubt that, if Her Majesty were to decline the invitation, therewould be considerable feeling in Ceylon and the success of The Queen&apos;s visitwould be gravely prejudiced. Taking off or covering shoes is a regular act ofcourtesy performed when persons enter a place of worship such as a mosque, andsuch acts have certainly been performed by Viceroys and Royal Personages invarious countries in the past. It is, in fact, similar to the practice of taking off one&apos;shat in church.4. In all the circumstances, I feel sure that The Queen will be well advised to accept the invitation.5. It occurred to me that it might help to avoid misunderstanding if it werearranged that Her Majesty&apos;s shoes were not removed but were shod with some othercoveting. I telegraphed personally to the Governor-General of Ceylon asking himwhether this would be a possible alternative. He has replied that lie regrets to saythat no alternative to the removal of shoes would be possible. He adds that noreligious significance is attached to it in Ceylon and that the Bishop of Colombo,who has been consulted, has no objection to the removal:SWINTON.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,8th February, 1954.45662Printed for the Cabinet. February 1954
NOTEWhen in 1951 it was intended that Her Royal Highness Princess Elizabethshould visit Ceylon, it was arranged that one of the principal items in the programme should be a Royal procession of elephants, &amp;c, known as the Raja Perahera, atKandy, in her honour. The intention was that Her Royal Highness, following the&apos;.. w traditional custom of the Kings of Kandy should witness the procession from theOctagon, an annexe of the Temple of the Tooth, the most sacred Buddhist templein Ceylon. Access to the Octagon is through the Temple and it was proposed thatHer Royal Highness, following the practice of the Kings of Kandy, on her wayto the Octagon should visit the Shrine Room of the Sacred Tooth, a relic tradi-tionally believed to be the tooth of Buddha. It was agreed at the time that on hervisit to the Shrine Her Royal Highness would remove her shoes and make a goldoffering.2. This programme was given some publicity in the press in this country andled to protests on the ground that it would involve reverence to a heathen idol.Owing to the death of King George VI, however, the visit of Her Royal Highnessto Ceylon did not take place.3. When the arrangements for The Queen&apos;s present visit were being considered,the Prime Minister wrote privately to the Prime Minister of Ceylon (Mr. DudleySenanayake) as described in his note and in January 1953 received the reply thatMr. Senanayake thought it best that The Queen should not visit the Temple.4. No more was heard of this matter till the beginning of last month, whenthe authorities of the Temple of the Tooth revived the proposal that The Queen,on her way to the Octagon, should enter the Shrine Room of the sacred relic and see the relic, together with the Temple jewellery. They gave an assurance thatthere would be no question of any act of worship or homage; The Queen wouldnot be invited to make any offering, but she would be expected to remove her shoesin the Shrine Room itself. The Prime Minister and the Governor-General of Ceylondid their utmost to persuade the authorities not to press this proposal, but without success. The Temple authorities insisted that no religious significance could or would be attached to acceptance of their invitation; that the relic had been exhibitedto previous Members of the Royal House; that refusal would be construed by thegreat majority of inhabitants, numbering about 5 million out of 8 millioninhabitants of Ceylon, as an insult to their religion; and that, in that event, it wouldbe impossible for the Perahera to be held.5. In these circumstances, the Prime Minister of Ceylon agreed to submit the invitation to The Queen through the Governor-General, who has transmittedit to Sir Michael Adeane, informing him that he completely concurs in the PrimeMinisters advice. The Governor-General has also informed Sir Michael Adeanethat, in his opinion, if the relic were not seen by The Queen and the Perahera not held, extremists would take the opportunity to fan the flames of religious fanaticism,with results which would be most detrimental to the success of the Royal visit.6. The Governor-General states that every effort will be made in the press and elsewhere to emphasise that the mere viewing of the relic has no religioussignificance whatever. He adds that the proceedings will only take a few minutes,and that the removal of the shoes cannot be interpreted as an act of worship orhomage. Steps will be taken to screen The Queen and ensure absolute privacywhen she takes off her shoes before entering the Shrine. Immediately she leavesit they will be put on again.
