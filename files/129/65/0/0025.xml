Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1954CONFIDENTIAL CABINET OFFICE Copy No.C. (54) 25 RECORD COPY25th January, 1954CABINETINTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, 1952Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service this memorandum contains my proposals for action on the Conventions andRecommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference at the35th Session in June 1952, viz. :-Convention (No. 101) concerning Holidays with Pay in Agriculture.Recommendation (No. 93) concerning Holidays with Pay in Agriculture.Convention (No. 102) concerning Minimum Standards of Social Security.Convention (No. 103) concerning Maternity Protection (Revised).Recommendation (No. 95) concerning Maternity Protection.Recommendation (No. 94) concerning Consultation and Co-operationbetween Employers and Workers at the Level of the Undertaking.2. Under the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, Con-ventions and Recommendations have to be brought before the competent authorities of Member States within a year (or at most eighteen months) of their adoption for the enactment of legislation or other action. It is our practice tocommunicate the Governmenfs proposals on such instruments to Parliament bymeans of a White Paper.3. The texts of the Conventions and Recommendations were presented toParliament with the report of the Government delegates to the 35th Session of theConference (Cmd. 8825). In annex a summary of the contents of these instruments and the detailed considerations that have led to my proposals, which are asfollows (I) that the Convention (No. 101) concerning Holidays with Pay in Agri-culture should not be ratified because it would impose upon the Govern-ment a responsibility to ensure the grant of holidays with pay to agricultural workers which would be inconsistent with the discretionvested in the independent statutory Agricultural Wages Boards inGreat Britain, and that the supplementary Recommendation (No. 93),which raises the same basic difficulty, should not be accepted.       : : \(2) that the Convention (No. 102) concerning Minimum Standards of social security should be ratified and that the ratification should specify sixbranches of social security for which the standards laid down in theConvention will be observed.(3) that the Convention (No. 103) concerning Maternity Protection (Revised)should not be ratified, because the law and practice in this country,based on different principles of maternity protection, are not in con-formity with the provisions of the Convention, and that the supple-mentary Recommendation (No. 95) should, for the same reasons, not,. -&apos; be accepted. .(4) that the Recommendation (No. 94) concerning Consultation andCo-operation between. Employers and Workers at the Level of theUndertaking should be accepted. , ;
4. The Conventions and Recommendations are ratified or accepted on behalfof both Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Ministry of Labour and national insurance of Northern Ireland have been consulted and concur in the action proposed..; , 5. If these proposals are approved, authority is sought for the issue of a white paper, based in large part on the terms of the Annex, which I will circulate to mycolleagues for information in due course.W. M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,20th January, 1954.     &quot;.    -   ANNEXDescription of, and Comments on, the Conventions and recommendations adopted by the 35th session of the international labourConference, 1952Convention (No: 101) concerning Holidays with Pay in AgricultureThis Convention provides that workers employed in agricultural undertakings and related occupations shall be granted an annual holiday with pay after a periodof continuous service.with the same employer. The manner in which effect is givento this provision is left for national decision but the Convention states that such provision may be made by means of collective agreements or by entrusting the regulation of holidays with pay to special bodies. The undertakings or occupationsto which the Convention is applied are also left for national determination. the required minimum period of continuous service and the minimum duration of the holiday are to be determined by, and the holiday remuneration is to be either notless than the worker&apos;s usual remuneration or calculated as prescribed by, national laws or regulations, collective agreements, arbitration awards, or by special bodiesentrusted with the determination of holidays with pay in agriculture or in any othermanner approved by the competent authority. The Convention also includes provision for such matters as special treatment for young workers; longer holidayson the basis of length of service; proportionate holidays in cases where the continuous service is not long enough to qualify the worker for the annual holiday;the exclusion of public and customary holidays, weekly rest periods and certaintemporary absences from.the annual holiday; the division of the holiday; and payment of the remuneration due for holidays not taken in cases of dismissal. Itis laid down that agreements to relinquish the right to an annual paid holiday shallbe void. An adequate system of inspection and supervision to ensure the applica-tion of the provisions of the Convention is to be maintained.2. It is proposed that the Government should not ratify this Conventionbecause of a fundamental difficulty arising from the obligation (contained inArticle 1 of the Convention) to ensure that workers in agricultural undertakings and related occupations are granted an annual holiday with pay. Under the agricultural wages legislation at present in operation in Great Britain independent statutoryauthorities (Agricultural Wages Boards) set up. by the legislation are empowered to fix holidays with pay and have in fact done so. The use of this power is notobligatory however, and the. Boards&apos; have complete freedom to decide whether any,and if so what, holidays should be fixed.*3. While the Convention allows the determination of holidays with pay to beentrusted to special bodies, this in no way affects the responsibility of Governmentsunder the Constitution of the International LabourOrganisation to ensure thatratified Conventions are effectively applied. If, therefore, the Government were to* -Note:1 The position in Northern Ireland in relation to Article. 1: of the Convention is different fromthat in Great Britain in that the current agricultural wages legislation, provides for anannual holiday with pay of six days. -
ratify the Convention, they would accept an ultimate responsibility to make pro-vision&quot; for holidays with pay in agriculture should the Boards decide to discontinue the use of the powers vested in them. It may well be that the Boards are, inpractice, most unlikely ever to come to such a decision. The acceptance by theGovernment of the obligation contained in Article 1 of the Convention would,however, be clearly inconsistent with the relationship between the Government andthe Agricultural Wages Boards which is established under the terms of the existing law. If the Government were to accept an ultimate responsibility in regard toholidays with pay, there is an obvious danger that this might give rise in the future to demands for Governmental intervention in regard to other matters within the discretion of the Boards. This, in turn, might well have repercussions on theoperation of statutory wage-fixing machinery generally. The basic difficulty forthe United Kingdom in connection with this Convention was explained to theInternational Labour Conference by the United Kingdom Government delegation which abstained on the final vote on the Convention.Recommendation (No. 93) concerning Holidays with Pay in Agriculture4. The Recommendation contains a number of detailed provisions whichare supplementary to those contained in Convention No. 101.All these matters are, in Great Britain, left to the discretion of the agricultural wages Boards and there is the same fundamental difficulty as exists in the caseOf Article 1 of Convention No. 101. Moreover, the existing law and practice inthe United Kingdom as a whole is not in conformity with certain provisions of theRecommendation. In these circumstances it is proposed that the Governmentshould not accept the Recommendation.Convention (No. 102) concerning Minimum Standards of Social Security5. Unlike the. earlier International Labour Conventions on Social security which applied only to individual branches or aspects of the subject, this convention is intended to cover social security as a whole and applies to all the importantbranches of social security, viz., medical care, social security payments for sickness,unemployment, old age, industrial injury, maternity, invalidity and survivorship,and family benefit. It reflects the modern tendency (of which our own scheme isthe leading example) to group the different branches together in a single compre-hensive system. In framing the Convention at the Conference a prominent partwas played by the Government delegations of the countries with well-developedsocial security schemes, notably the United Kingdom, France and other countriesassociated with Us in the Brussels Treaty Organisation and the Council of Europe.6. The Convention lays down some general requirements such as finance,rights of appeal, &amp;c, and lists the minimum standards that should be observed in each of the nine social security branches. These standards concern such matters as the proportion of the population to be protected against the particular risk,the conditions on which the benefit is to be given and the length of time for whichit must be continued. There are also requirements, which are discussed in para-graph 9, about the minimum rates at which the various cash payments should bemade. These payments may be made either through an insurance scheme or(except for industrial injury and maternity) through a scheme of the &quot; assistance &quot;type involving a means test.7. To be entitled to ratify the Convention a country, in addition to complying with the general requirements, must show that its scheme observes the minimum standards in at least three branches of social security, including at least One of thefollowing- -unemployment, old age, industrial injury, invalidity and survivors&apos;benefit. This is the bare minimum, but on the basis of present legislation theUnited Kingdom can do better. Should ratification be decided on, it would bepossible to specify in the act of ratification six branches, viz., ihedical care, on thestrength of the national health services; family benefits, on the strength of the family allowances scheme; and sickness, Unemployment, old age and survivorship,On the strength of either the national insurance scheme or the national assistancescheme. A!       -       &apos;:/:;;!&apos; 8. It would not be possible to ratify for industrial injuries because, althoughthe. rates of cash benefits are well above the prescribed1 minima, the Conventionrequires all drugs and appliances tobesuppliedLentirelyfree-of cost in cases ofindustrial accidents or diseases. The small charge made for prescriptions and the45552 &quot;&quot;&quot; b 2
fact.that the patient has to share in the cost of certain appliances raise a technicaldifficulty in the way of ratification. Nor would it be possible to ratify for maternitywhere the Convention prescribes a rate of benefit for working women which isaltogether out of scale with the other benefits. As against the rate of 32s. 6d. perweek provided for in the new maternity legislation the Convention would require a rate of 53s. 6%d. for a woman who would normally have a husband in work; thisis nearly as much as it prescribes by way -of sickness benefit for a man with adependent wife and two children. The Convention as drafted does not enablethe Government to take any credit for the fact that the new maternity allowance is paid for as long as 18 weeks, and that in addition we provide certain lump summaternity grants which are given whether the woman is gainfully occupied or not.it would also be undesirable for the ratification to specify invalidity; the actualrequirements of this part of the Convention appear to be based upon certainforeign schemes whose underlying principles are different from those in operationhere, though they do not in fact provide better cover in this contingency.9. The only general provision which calls for special comment arises fromthe requirements about the minimum rates at which social security payments should be made. The Convention does not oblige a country to follow any particularmethod for fixing its rates, but the payments themselves must not be below a figure which in the case of schemes like that of the United Kingdom is to be calculated in relation to the wages of a typical worker in the country concerned. Accordingly,the test whether a country&apos;s social security payments comply with the Conventioninvolves comparison with standard rates which are fixed in relation to wages. Inthe case of the United Kingdom the standard of reference would be the wage ofan unskilled adult male engineering labourer (now approximately .119*. a week).The benefits for a family (usually a man, wife and two children) must amount to a specified percentage of that wage, account being taken of any family allowancespayable. The percentages, which range from 40 to 50 according to the particularbenefit, when applied to the wage do not produce a very onerous requirement. Bothinsurance benefits and assistance scales pass the test on the basis of the standardwage as it stands now and leave a fair safety margin in case of a rise in the standardwage. So far as can be judged, this margin is likely to be sufficient to cover any increase in the standard wage which may be granted as a result of the presentwages claim in the engineering industry. If, however, as a consequence of cost-of-living increases in the future, the wage ever went beyond that point, considera-tions of home policy, quite irrespective of any international commitment, might make it necessary to increase assistance scales and probably insurance benefit ratesalso, at least up to the amount required by the Convention. It is clear, therefore,that the Government could safely accept this requirement.10. It is very desirable from the international point of view that the UnitedKingdom, a pioneer in the field of unified social security systems and one of the mostadvanced countries in. the world in this respect, should ratify this Convention,which it has taken a prominent part in framing, and it is therefore proposedthat the Government should do so. It is proposed that the instrument of ratification should specify the Parts relating to medical care, sickness benefit,unemployment benefit, old age benefit, family benefit and survivors&apos; benefit.Convention (No. 103) concerning Maternity Protection (Revised) and Recom-mendation (No. 95) concerning Maternity Protection11. The Convention, which revises an earlier Convention (No. 3) of 1919,contains the same fundamental principles as the 1919 Convention, which has notbeen ratified by the United Kingdom Government. The present Conventionapplies to women employed in industrial undertakings and in non-industrial and agricultural occupations, including women wage earners working at home. it provides for a period , of maternity leave of at least twelve weeks&apos; duration, ofwhich a period of at least six weeks after confinement is to be compulsory. Theremainder of the leave may be taken before the presumed date of confinementor following the period of compulsory leave after confinement, or partly before thepresumed date of confinement and partly after the period of compulsory leave.A womaniaking! maternity leave in accordance with the provisions of the Conven-tion must not be given notice of dismissal during her absence, nor must she begiven notice which would expire during the period of absence. The Conventionrequires that during the period of maternity leave the woman shall be entitled tocash arid medical benefits. These are to be provided either by means of compulsory
social insurance or by means of public funds. The rates of cash benefit must besufficient for the full and healthy maintenance of the woman and her child inaccordance with a suitable standard of living. The medical benefits must includepre-natal, confinement and post-natal care by qualified midwives or medical practitioners as well as hospital care where necessary. It is provided that nursing mothers shall be entitled to interrupt their work for the purpose of nursing their children at a time or times to be prescribed by national laws or regulations.12. The Recommendation is.supplementary to the Convention.; It coversbroadly the same ground as the Convention and contains provisions which, in several respects, go beyond those provided for in the Convention.    :13. The law and practice of the United Kingdom are not in conformity withthe provisions of either of these instruments. So far as maternity benefits areconcerned, the cash benefits provided for employed women under the national insurance Acts are designed to compensate for loss of earnings for at least the periods envisaged in the Convention and to make it possible for women to refrain from working during these periods. It cannot, however, be claimed that the. benefits are themselves sufficient to provide for the &quot; full and healthy maintenance of the woman and her child &quot; as required by the Convention. Where, however, the familyis in need, the benefits are supplemented by National Assistance to an amountsufficient for this purpose. While this could be said to achieve the general objects of the social security provisions of the Convention, it is not in precise conformitywith those provisions. The main difficulty for the United Kingdom Governmentlies, however, in the provisions which would require the enactment of legislation in regard to employment before and after childbirth, including statutory maternityleave. These are based on principles which are foreign to the approach to maternityprotection in this country. It has not been thought necessary or desirable in theUnited Kingdom to rely for the protection of maternity on special legislative prohibition-bitions or restrictions on the employment or dismissal of women before and afterchildbirth. The protection at which the Convention aims has been achieved hererather by a combination of advanced social security provisions, highly organisedarrangements for health education and medical advice, and legal obligations andtrade practice relating to the protection of women workers generally. The Recom-mendation presents even more strongly the same difficulties as the Convention.The United Kingdom Government delegates explained, the United Kingdomposition to the International Labour Conference and the delegation abstained onthe final vote on both instruments. It is proposed, in these circumstances, that theGovernment should neither ratify the Convention nor accept the Recommendation.Recommendation (No, 94) concerning Consultation and Co-operation between employers and Workers at the level of the Undertaking14. The Recommendation is a short instrument consisting of two paragraphsonly. The first paragraph enunciates the general principle that appropriate steps should be taken to promote consultation and co-operation between employers and workers at the level of the undertaking on matters of mutual concern not withinthe scope of collective bargaining machinery or not normally dealt with by othermachinery concerned with the determination of terms and Conditions of employ-ment. The second paragraph deals with alternative methods of implementing theprinciple, and covers the case of countries where co-operation is provided for by national legislation as well as that of countries like the United Kingdom whereco-operation is a matter for voluntary agreement between employers and workers.It is provided that, in accordance with national custom or practice, consultation and co-operation should be facilitated by the encouragement of- voluntary agree-ments; or promoted by laws or regulations setting up the bodies for consultation and co-operation; or facilitated or promoted by a combination of these methods.   .&quot;15: It is proposed that the Government should accept this Recommendation.It is established Government policy to promote consultation and co-operationbetween employers and workers on the basis of voluntary agreements between the parties. Steps have been taken through the National Joint AdvisoryCouncil to encourage the Conclusion of such agreements, and it is proposed to bringthe Recommendation, together with a: Resolution adopted by the Inter national labour Conference dealing with the matter in more detail, to the attention of theNational Joint Advisory Council/
