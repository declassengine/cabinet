Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1954SECRETC. (54) 1513th January, 1954CABINETSELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIONALISED industries memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilIntroductionOn 4th December, 1951, the House of Commons ordered:  &quot; That a Select Committee be appointed to consider the present methods by which the House of Commons is informed of the affairs of the nationalised industries and to report what changes, having regard to the provisions laiddown by Parliament in the relevant Statutes, may be desirable in these methods.&quot;In October 1952 this Select Committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. RalphAssheton, M.P., made an interim report (House of Commons Paper 332-1) onthe admissibility of Parliamentary questions about the nationalised industries andin July 1953 a final report (House of Commons Paper 235) in which the Committeeunanimously. recommended the establishment of a permanent Select Committeeof the House of Commons under a standing Order in the following terms:  &quot; There shall be a Select Committee, to be designated the Committee on nationalised Industries, for examining the Reports and Accounts of, and for obtaining further information as to the general policy and practice of, the nationalised Industries established by Statute, whose controlling Boards are wholly appointed by Ministers of the Crown and whose annual receipts arenot wholly or mainly derived from moneys provided by Parliament or advancedfrom the Exchequer. The Committee shall consist of not more than twenty-one members, who shall be nominated at the commencement of every session and of whom seven shall be a quorum. The Committee shall have powerto appoint sub-committees from its own members. The Committee and anysuch sub-committee shall have power to send for persons, papers and records,and to report from time to time.&quot;It will be necessary to arrange for the House of Commons to debate thisrecommendation at an early date and for the Government to determine in advancewhat attitude it should adopt towards it.2. The general lines of the evidence which the Lord Privy Seal gave beforethe Select Committee had been approved beforehand by the Home Affairs Com-mittee (HA. (53) 46) although he made it perfectly clear to the Committee that it represented his personal views rather than considered decisions by the Government.He specifically suggested in the course of his evidence that a Standing Joint SelectCommittee of both Houses might be set up which might investigate the currentpolicies of the Boards of the nationalised industries on general issues.3. The Home Affairs Committee (H.A. (53) 22nd Meeting, Minute 2, and23rd Meeting, Minute 1) have now considered the problem further in the lightof the Select Committee&apos;s Report and I am submitting their conclusions forconsideration by the Cabinet.45492Copy No.
Case for a Standing committee . The case for tile establishment of a Standing Select Committee on the nationalised industries may be stated briefly thus. It has been the object to createin the nationalised industries a form of organisation which combines public owner-ship with commercial autonomy. The responsibility of the Boards of the industries to shareholders has been replaced by their responsibility through Ministers toParliament. The problem is to enable Parliament to play its new role effectivelywithout impairing the Boards&apos; commercial autonomy.5. It has been the view of the Home Affairs Committee that the existingmeans whereby Parliament is informed about the affairs of the nationalised industries mainly through Parliamentary Questions and debates on the Boards&apos;annual Reports and on any Private Bills which the Boards may promote are inadequate. The Committee do not recommend any action by the Governmentupon the proposal in the Select Committee&apos;s First Report that a rather wider range of Questions about the nationalised industries should be allowed to appearupon the Order Paper. The appointment of a Standing Select Committee would,however, offer an alternative means Of securing that Parliament is better informedthan at present about the industries&apos; affairs.Case Against a Standing committee. The Minister of Fuel and Power has expressed certain apprehensions aboutthe consequences of the appointment of a Standing Select Committee. He considersthat, however carefully its terms of reference might be drawn, its establishmentwould be bound to duplicate the existing channel of accountability between the boards of the nationalised industries and Parliament namely, the responsible ministers. He is further of the opinion that the need for such an innovation hasbeen reduced by recent developments, at least so far as the nationalised fuel and power industries are concerned. Thus, opinion on both sides of the House appearsto be satisfied for the time being with plans for enquiring into the organisationof the coal industry and the Minister has in mind to appoint in the near future an outside committee of enquiry into the electricity industry. In these circumstances he considers that the Government would be well-advised at least to await the views to be expressed on both sides of the House in debate before publicly committing themselves to support of the proposal for a Standing Committee.7. The Ministers apprehensions are shared by one or two of our colleagues.The Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, the other Minister with a direct&apos;departmental interest, is, however, of the opinion that the Government are toodeeply committed to the principle, of a Standing Committee to withhold. their support from it at this stage. -The General View8. The general view of the Home Affairs Committee continues to be in favourof a Standing Select Committee, which could be expected to create in parliamentary valuable nucleus of opinion well-informed on the nationalised industries&apos; affairs.The Committee considered that, taking the long view, the Government would beill-advised to miss an opportunity, which might well not recur, to secure the estab-lishment of such a. committee on the unanimous recommendation of a SelectCommittee representative of both sides of the House. At the same time theCommittee have recognised the need so to draw the terms of reference of sucha Standing Committee as to avoid so far as possible the dangers which some ofour colleagues see in the proposal to establish it. They considered that the approach of the Government spokesmen to the House in the forthcoming debate should beon the lines that the Government favoured in principle the recommendations in theSelect Committee&apos;s Report, subject to any necessary detailed modifications and toany views which might be expressed from either side of the House in debate.Joint Select Committee; .9. The Home Affairs Committee were impressed by the advantages of appointing a Joint Select Committee of both Houses for the purpose in view. they considered that suitable peers would be likely to bring to the deliberations of such
a body both valuable experience and a less partisan approach. The Select Com-raittee had themselves recognised the arguments in favour of a Joint committee but on balance had decided &quot; with some regrets &quot; that a Select Committee of theHouse of Commons was to be preferred.10. On this aspect of the matter due weight must naturally be given to opinion in the House of Lords itself. I am in course of trying to obtain the agreement ofthe other Party Leaders there to the tranmission of a formal request by the lords to the Commons asking to be provided with a copy of the Commons Select Com-mittee&apos;s Report with a view to its being considered by a Select Committee of theHouse of Lords. If was suggested in the Home Affairs Committee that there wouldbe positive advantage in avoiding any pressure from the House of Lords for theestablishment of a Standing Joint Select Committee until after the principle of a standing Committee had been accepted by the House of Commons.Terms of Reference11. There appears to be general agreement that the Standing Committee&apos;terms of reference should not cover matters which fall into the category of detailedadministration, but be confined to matters of general policy and practice. In thecourse of their Report, the Select Committee expressed the view that the StandingCommittee&apos;s scope should extend to future plans and programmes. The HomeAffairs Committee were unanimously of the opinion, however, that the StandingCommittee should be specifically precluded from concerning themselves with futureplans, particularly those involving substantial expenditure of money. They were inclined to favour terms of reference on the lines suggested by the Select Committeethemselves in paragraph 27 of their Report, and set out in the first sentence of thedraft Standing Order quoted in paragraph 1 above, with the possible substitution of &quot; current &quot; for &quot; general &quot; in the phrase &quot; as to the general policy and practiceof the nationalised industries.&quot;Permanent Official12. The Select Committee recommended that there should be attached to theStanding Committee a permanent official of a status roughly equivalent to that ofthe Comptroller and Auditor-General who, with the assistance of at least one pro-fessional accountant and such other staff as might be found necessary, would examine the Reports and Accounts of the nationalised industries in order to direct the Committee&apos;s attention to matters requiring examination. The Home AffairsCommittee agreed, however, that it would be a mistake, at any rate at the outset,to appoint such an Official, who would tend to develop into a powerful and stronglyentrenched critic of ministerial policy in relation to the nationalised industries. Itshould suffice if, apart from the normal Secretarial staff, the Treasury were to makea senior officer available to the Committee in a general advisory capacity. Inaddition, the Ministry of Fuel and Power and the Ministry of Transport and CivilAviation might each nominate a senior officer who would represent his minister when the Committee was taking evidence and generally assist the Committee as required in relation to a particular nationalised industry.Sub-Committees13. The Home Affairs Committee also agreed that the Select Committee&apos;suggestion that&apos; the proposed Standing Committee should have power to appointsub-committees should be resisted. Experience both of the war-time Select Com-mittee on National Expenditure and of the Select Committee on Estimates shows the extent to which a Standing Committee&apos;s possession of this power increases thedifficulty of confining its activities within its terms of reference.Summary of Recommendations14. On behalf of the Home Affairs Committee I invite the Cabinet toagree: (1) that, in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons on the Report ofthe Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, the government spokesmen should take the line that the Government favour the Select&apos; ?Committee&apos;s recommendations in principle subject to any necessarydetailed modifications and to consideration of any views which may be expressed from either side of the House in debate;
(2) that, subject to opinion in the House of Lords itself, it should remain theGovernments intention that, if possible, any Standing Committee on the nationalised Industries which may be established should be a JointCommittee of the two Houses.(3) that the Standing Committee&apos;s terms of reference should be on the general lines recommended by the Select Committee in paragraph 27 of theirReport, subject to its being made clear that future plans and programmes of the nationalised Boards are excluded.(4) that the proposals that there should be attached to the Standing Committeean official of status roughly equivalent to that of the Comptroller and auditor-General and that the Standing Committee should have powerto appoint&apos; sub-committees should be resisted.S.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,12th January, 1954.
