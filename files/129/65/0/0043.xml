confidnetial cabinet office record copy copy No,C. (54) 439th February, 1954CABINETWEIGHTS AND MEASURES LEGISLATION: DEFINITION OF the yard AND THE POUND IN TERMS OF THE METREAND THE KILOGRAMMEMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI think that my colleagues may like to know that an approach is about to bemade to the United States Government on certain matters arising on the Report ofthe Committee on Weights and Measures Legislation (Cmd. 8219), which was published in May, 1951.2.   The Report contained, inter alia, the following recommendations:  (i) The Government should take steps, in concert with the commonwealth and the United States, to abolish the Imperial System of measurementin favour of the complete adoption of the Metric System over aperiod of about twenty years.(ii) Whether this long-term proposal (i) were accepted or not, the ImperialYard should be defined as 0-9144 of the International Metre exactlyand the Imperial Pound as either 0-453 592 37 or 0-453 592 3 of theInternational Kilogramme exactly; and the United States Governmentshould be informed of these proposals in the hope of securing identicalvalues for the yard and the pound in both countries,(iii). After a period of five years, none of the existing troy weights or penny-weights should any longer be lawful for use in trade; and the Govern-ment, if it accepted these proposals, should so inform the Common-wealth and the United States and should invite them to take similar and,if possible, simultaneous steps.3. Consultations, begun under the Labour Government, showed that all theCommonwealth Governments were either in favour of, or would raise no objectionto, the implementation of the recommendation that the yard and the pound shouldbe defined in terms of the metre and the kilogramme, but that very few of them werein favour of the complete adoption of the Metric System in place of the ImperialSystem. No approach was made at that time to the United States Government,since the Foreign Office advised that the prior agreement of all the other Govern-ments concerned would place us in a much better position to press the americans to meet us.4. In 1952, after I had re-examined the whole Report in the light of these enquiries, I made a statement in the House of Commons about it (with the agree-ment of the Home Affairs Committee HA. (52) 29th Meeting, Item 2). I saidthat the Government were prepared to accept the proposed re-definition of the yard and pound, but I definitely rejected the suggested adoption of the MetricSystem. I added that consultations on the other recommendations would be initiated with the trading, local authority and other organisations concerned.Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1954
5. These consultations have been going on since then, and we now proposeto approach the United States Government to see whether they would be prepared (a) to alter the definitions of their yard and pound to bring them into line withthose recommended by the Committee; and(b) to abolish the troy and pennyweight systems of measurement.At the same time we propose to sound them on the possibility of establishing adefinite numerical relationship between their gallon and ours.6. The Imperial System of measurement is used in the British commonwealth and by the United States of America, and all the Commonwealth countries until recently based their yards and pounds on the Imperial Standards in Westminster,so that their units of length and mass have varied in the same way as the british units. But the United States has for the past 60 years or so defined its yard andpound in terms of the International Metre and Kilogramme, so that, although theywere originally intended to be the same as the British yard and pound, they are nowin fact, owing to the physical variation of the Imperial Standards and the greaterconstancy of the Metric Standards, different from the British yard and pound.Canada re-defined its yard and pound in terms of the metre and kilogramme twoor three years ago, and used ratios which differ both from the most recently ascer-tained experimental values for the Imperial Units, and from the arbitrary ratiosproposed in the Weights and Measures Report. Australia is about to do the same.7. The differences between the units are extremely small and have nosignificance for ordinary trade; but recently standards of engineering accuracyhave increased to the extent that, for certain gauges of very fine tolerance used forthe highest precision work, the differences in the yards are beginning to have somesignificance, and we have already had a protest from a precision-gauge maker aboutthe delay in implementing the present recommendation. Differences in the poundhave not yet attained any significance even in the highest precision use.8. The recommendation for re-defining the yard and pound would meanabandonment of the primacy of the Standards kept at Westminster, but against this there would be only one yard and pound in the Commonwealth and if theUnited States is prepared to vary very slightly the present ratios set between theiryards and pounds and the metre and kilogramme, the whole world would be usingreconcilable units of measurement in the Imperial System in the same way as it now uses the units of the Metric System. (We know that Canada would be willingto make the amendment.)9. The troy and pennyweight systems of measurement are used in the UnitedKingdom, the Commonwealth, and. the United States solely for dealings in preciousmetals; the rest of the world uses the Metric System for this purpose. The units are each defined by reference to the appropriate pound, the United Kingdomand the Commonwealth units by reference to the Imperial Pound and the UnitedStates unit by reference to United States pound. Here again, therefore, there areminute differences between the Commonwealth and United States units, but thechief reason for the proposed abolition of the two series is the simplification whichwould result in the Imperial System by the abolition of the ounce troy (480 grains)which is quite different from the ounce avoirdupois (431\ grains) which is theounce chiefly used in trade. Consultations with a number of organisations in thiscountry have shown considerable support for the proposal provided similar andsimultaneous action is taken by the United States of America and theCommonwealth.10. The Imperial and American gallons differ to such an extent (the Americangallon is roughly five-sixths of ours) that it is considered unreasonable to suggest any adjustment of values to bring the units into agreement, but it is possible thata fixed numerical relationship could be agreed between them by defining eachin terms of the litre.11. The Commonwealth countries and the Colonies have recently been askedfor their views on the abolition of the troy and pennyweight systems and on the relationship between the gallons.:&apos;, . &quot;V-; ^ p.
