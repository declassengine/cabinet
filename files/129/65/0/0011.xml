secret CABINET o,-c&apos;r*1  t \JIc(54) 11 R&amp;.GORD COPY        copy no.&apos;^12th january, 1954CABINETTHE LEGAL POSITION IN EGYPTNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the consideration of my colleagues the attached memorandum on the legal position regarding the Anglo-Egyptian Treatyof 1936.    This has been prepared in consultation with the Lord chancellor and the Law Officers.A.E.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.11TH JANUARY, 1954.LEGAL POSITION REGARDING THE ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TREATYof 1936Present PositionEgypt1 s purported repudiation of the.Treaty in 1951, on the groundthat it was negotiated under duress, gave us the right to terminate theTreaty; we elected not to exercise that right and consequently the Treaty,which contains no provision for unilateral denunciation, remains in fullforce.2. It follows that if Egypt seeks to rely on the provisions of theTreaty, Her Majesty&apos;s Government cannot refuse to comply with its terms on the ground that it has been repudiated by Egypt.3. The numbers of Her Majesty&apos;s land forces are by the annex to Article 8 of the Treaty limited to 10,000, and of the air forces to400 pilots, together with the necessary ancillary personnel for adminsitrative and technical duties.    The present numbers very largelyexceed those limits and are in the region of 80,000.The retention in the Zone of forces such as these can bejustified, if at all, only on the ground that their presence is necessaryto preserve our rights under the Treaty.    There is grave doubt whether before any International Court or body we should succeed in this plea.-1-
4. The Treaty contains no provision for negotiations for revisionbefore 1956 except by mutual consent.    While Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentare not therefore under any obligation to enter into negotiations for the revision of the Treaty before 1956, there is nothing to prevent our doing so and nothing to prevent Egypt from requesting that we should negotiatebefore then.Position in 19565. The Treaty does not come to an end in 1956.    After theexpiration of twenty years, i. e. after 26th August, 1956, the highcontracting parties are bound at the request of either of them to enter into negotiations &quot;with a view to such revision of its terms by agreementbetween them as may be appropriate in the circumstances as they thenexist&quot;.If no such request is made and no revision takes place, theTreaty continues in force in its present form.6. Egypt could now or at any time ask us to enter into negotiationsfor a new treaty but they could not in 1956 request a revision of thepresent Treaty without recognising its continued existence and admittingthat it was not terminated by their unilateral denunciation.In view of the loss of face that such a request would involve,it is almost certain that Egypt will continue to maintain that the treaty is at an end and to demand our withdrawal from the Zone.7. The Treaty provides that in the event of agreement uponrevision not being reached, or if the parties are unable to agree upon&quot;the question whether the presence of British forces is no longer necessaryowing to the fact that the Egyptian Army is in a position to ensure by itsown resources the liberty and entire security of navigation of the Canal&quot;,the matter shall be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations orto such other arbitral body as the parties may agree upon.It would be difficult for Egypt to request arbitration upon thesematters without recognising the continued existence of the Treaty.Legally there is no automatic devolution of the functions of theCouncil of the former League to the Security Council of the United Nations,but we could not well oppose the suggestion that the latter body shouldarbitrate.8. In the unlikely eveiit of Egypt invoking the Treaty and requestingarbitration either as to the revision of the Treaty or as to the presenceof British troops being no longer necessary or both, we could contend that as Article 16 does not provide for termination but only for revision,it is not open to the arbitral body to decide that the Treaty should be terminated.If Egypt asserted that the presence of British troops was nolonger necessary the onus would be on her to establish the fact.    Thearbitral body might not be very ready to find that the presence of Britishtroops on Egyptian soil against the will of Egypt was necessary for thepurposes specified, particularly if it was proved that Egypt possessed an

Thearbitral body might not be very ready to find that the presence of Britishtroops on Egyptian soil against the will of Egypt was necessary for thepurposes specified, particularly if it was proved that Egypt possessed an
Xarmy of some size reasonably well equipped with modern arms.    we might then have difficulty in advancing and establishing the argument that the reason why British troops were still necessary was the lack of fighting qualify of Egyptian troops.9. If Egypt, maintaining that the Treaty was at an end andconsequently that we had no right to remain in Egypt^ referred thematter, without invoking the Treaty * to the Security Council as a matteraffecting peace and security or as &quot;a Situation which might lead to international friction&quot; (Article 34 of the Charter^ the question whetherthe Treaty was still in force would have to be determined and thequestion whether we had complied with its provisions might also haveto be decided.    Egypt may allege that when the aftermath of war was over and before our rights under the Treaty were threatened, we stillkept in the Zone troops in excess of the agreed numbers and that it was this breach on our part that led to their repudiation and threats.    Theymay further contend that we cannot now justify the retention of numbers in excess of those agreed on account of their repudiation and threatssince their conduct was a consequence of our breach.    We have dealtwith the question in paragraph 3 above.We might secure that these questions were referred by theSecurity Council to the International Court for decision;  but if theSecurity Council did not take this course and treated the matter as a dispute, we should lose our vote and consequently our veto underArticle 27 (3) of the Charter as regards any conclusion arrived at bythe Council.    We should retain our veto as regards any further action by the Council directed towards enforcing its conclusion, but would notbe able to avoid the conclusion itself as an expression of the Councilsview.    This view is likely to be strongly influenced by the considerations set out in the second part of paragraph 8 above.
