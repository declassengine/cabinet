c-(54) 29 CABINET OFFICE27TH JANUARY, 1954 RECORD COPYCABINETEGYPT: DEFENCE negotiations memorandum by the Minister of. StateIt is still the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view that our best course isto strive for an agreement with Egypt on the present terms, with as muchsupport from the United States as they can be induced to give.2. The present situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely.It is costing too much manpower and money.    Our re-deployment in theMiddle East is being hampered.    Our soldiers are being murdered.3. It would be wrong to decide to fix a time-limit to the negotiationsuntil we have decided what to do if, by the end of the time-limit, there isstill no agreement.4. The Foreign Secretary set out, in paragraph 6 of C, (54) 6, thethree courses open if we fail to obtain an agreement:-Course (a)  - to stay on indefinitely - is open to the disadvantages of no economy in men and money, progressive deterioration of the Base,awkward international repercussions and growing Egyptian hostility.Course (b) - to announce liquidation of the Base, evacuation of the canal Zone and re-deployment in our own time - would be represented as a scuttle.    It would do great damage to the Government at home andto British prestige abroad.    It would be tantamount to admitting that the egyptians had been too strong for us.Course (c) is set out in detail in paragraph &amp;(c) of C. (54) 6.    Itamounts to a decision to liquidate the Base and to re-deploy in our owntime, but to maintain our rights under the 1936 Treaty, offering to submitany matters of disagreement about revision of that Treaty to internationalarbitration of some sort, and to enter into immediate discussion with the egyptians with a view to submitting these matters to arbitration.5. Course (c) wouJ.d annoy the Egyptians.    They would not getthe advantage of the Base, nor would they be rid of British troops in the canal Zone unless they agreed to a long and complicated internationallawsuit (and perhaps not even then).    We would probably get noco-operation at all from them in winding up the Base.    That task would therefore be more difficult.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No.
I OS6. Course (c) would be defensible with British opinion ;  it wouldbe better than Course (a) in that our international position in the controversywould be sounder;  it would enable us to keep troops in Egypt for severalcritical years.    If eventually we had to go, it would only be as a resultof our conforming with a ruling of an international tribunal,7, I recommend Course (c) as the course to be adopted if negotia-tions fail.8, If the recommendation in paragraph 7 is accepted, we have toconsider the next stages in the matter, including the fixing of a time-limit.9. It would be unwise to fix a time-limit that would not allow timefor United States action under paragraph 1.    We should also avoid ifpossible the impression of delivering an ultimatum,10, Bearing these factors in mind, I put forward the followingpossible course of action for the consideration of the Cabinet:-(a) an intimation to the United States that we have nothing to add to our proposals as communicated to them on 9th January, 1954 (see Appendix A to C, (54) 14(Revise));(b) a request to the United States to make a final approach to Egypt; we should inform them that we intend to fix a date by which the Egyptians must accept the presentoffer or it will be withdrawn;(c) when the United States have made this approach, weshould intimate to the Egyptians that there is a time-limit;(d) if the United States refuse to make this approach, weshould nevertheless tell the Egyptians that there isa time-limit;(e) at the expiry of the time-limit, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should inform the House of commons that our offer is withdrawn, and should give suchindication of our future course of action as might seem then to be advisable;(f) the time-limit to be intimated by us under (c) or(d) above should be 28 days.S,Ij,Foreign Office, S, W. 1.27TH JANUARY, 1954.
