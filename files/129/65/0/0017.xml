Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1954SECRETC. (54) 17 (Revise)20th January, 1954CABINETSTATIONING OF BRITISH FORCES IN JORDANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs with reference to the discussion on redeployment on 12th January(C.C. (54) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 7) my colleagues may wish to know the positionas regards the movement of British forces to Jordan.Movement of Jet Fighter Squadrons to Amman2. Under the Anglo-Jordan Treaty, Her Majesty&apos;s Government are entitledto maintain units of the Royal Air Force at Amman and Mafraq airfields. R.A.F.squadrons have not hitherto been stationed at either place, but have paid visitsfrom Habbaniya. Since 1951 work has been proceeding to develop Ammanairfield so that an RAF. squadron can be stationed there. This work has nowbeen completed and the airfield is to be ceremonially opened by King Hussein inthe next week or so. Middle East Air Force propose to send in a jet fighter squadron to attend the opening and thereafter to be permanently stationed there.Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Tel Aviv have reported that although the Israelis mightdislike this move they would have no valid ground for objection, and it might havea salutary effect in damping down aggressive tendencies in Israel. I have accordinglyagreed to the jet squadron going to Amman, and have arranged for the IsraelGovernment to be informed two or three days beforehand.Move of Armoured Squadron3. The Cabinet agreed on 19th November (C.C. (53) 68th Conclusions,Minute 6) that an armoured squadron should be sent to Ma&apos;an for training withthe Arab Legion in accordance with the Anglo-Jordan Treaty. The Jordan Govern-ment have since said they would prefer the squadron to be ostensibly stationed atAqaba so as to avoid publicity, and the Chiefs of Staff have agreed to this. the move has not yet been authorised owing to the unsatisfactory attitude adopted bythe Jordan Government in regard to the Israel proposal for high-level talks aboutthe Israel-Jordan Armistice, and the risk that our action in sending forces to Jordan(which is bound to become known) would be regarded as encouraging Jordanianintransigence.4. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Amman, however, reported on 11th Januarythat the King of Jordan had raised with him the question of the stationing ofBritish forces in Jordan. The Ambassador represents that the Jordanian Govern-menfs attitude towards Israel is dictated by internal considerations which will notbe much affected by any action of ours, and that on the other hand if we do not accept their invitation to send an armoured squadron we may let slip a valuablechance of building up our position there and getting a foot in the door as regardsthe eventual redeployment of larger forces.5. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador therefore recommends that we should informthe Jordanians:  (i) that we are sending the armoured squadron forthwith; and(ii) that we are ready to consider any proposal which they may wish to putforward for regularising the position of British ground forces in Jordan.45533Copy No.
(The Anglo-Jordan Treaty does not provide for the permanent stationing of Britishground forces in Jordan, but only for their engaging in joint training operations&quot; for a sufficient period in each year &quot;.)6. I agree with Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors views and think it important, inthe general context of our redeployment, to grasp the opportunity offered by king hussein&apos;s approach and the Jordan Governments invitation to send an armouredsquadron. Our positions in Jordan and Iraq are closely related; and any progress with the stationing of British forces in Jordan will have a favourable effect onIraq, which is also a crucial area for redeployment and where we are having some difficulty in preventing the Americans from undermining our position by offers of aid and equipment, especially to the Air Force. In my view Jordan and Iraqmust be the keystones of our redeployment east of the Canal Zone, and are allthe more important in view of the doubtful friendship of Egypt. Israel might beable to give us subsidiary facilities, but we cannot base ourselves entirely on israel and it is unfortunately true that any substantial co-operation with her would have a disastrous effect on Anglo-Arab relations, which are paramount from the point ofview of strategic facilities and of oil. In view of these considerations, and of thecourse of the recent meeting of the Arab League (on which I attach some commentsAnnex A), I believe that we must seize this opening which Jordan has given us and which will influence Iraq as would a response to the Turks now over Mardin.recommendation. I therefore recommend that we should at once proceed as proposed by her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Amman (paragraph 5 above).8. As regards Israeli reactions to this course, we informed the Israel Govern-ment early last year of our decision in principle to send an armoured brigade toJordan, and they raised no serious objection. I therefore now propose, as also agreed by the Cabinet on 19th November, to inform the Israel Government beforethe armoured squadron is moved, assuring them that British troops will not beused in Jordan for any aggressive purpose, but reminding them of our obligations under the Anglo-Jordan Treaty.9. I attach at Annex B the text of the draft telegrams which I recommend should be sent accordingly to Amman and Tel Aviv respectively.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,19th January, 1954.
ANNEX AThe recent meeting of the Arab League in Cairo has not gone badly for us.Fadl Jamali, the Iraqi Prime Minister, has taken the lead in resisting Egyptianneutralist policy. The Times correspondent from Cairo sums up the situation inthe following words:  &quot; It is clear, however, that in the course of the League council meetingsthe general attitude of the Arab States was that the policy of &apos; non-co-operation &apos; with western Powers that has been discussed in Egypt was tobe avoided if possible. It was hoped rather that Egypt and Britain would find a settlement of their differences on the basis of which a policy could be worked out for strengthening the Arab world in co-operation with the west.&quot;2. From all this it seems that even if the Egyptians themselves do not move to the extent necessary to make agreement on a treaty possible there should be agood chance now of consolidating our position with Iraq and Jordan. If we could do this, we should not only be achieving something useful in itself, but also puttingindirect pressure on Egypt. The Egyptians already feel that they are only a secondline of defence and it will do them no harm to have this confirmed.3. It is also important to consolidate our position in Iraq and Jordan, forin the former country in particular the Americans are showing a disturbingambition to replace us.ANNEX draft Telegram to AmmanYou may accept the Jordan Prime Minister&apos;s proposal that an armouredsquadron should be sent to Jordan as part of the Aqaba garrison and that it should proceed without a prior exchange of letters.2. This is, however, on the understanding, which you should specificallyconfirm with the Jordan Prime Minister, that the armoured squadron will immediately proceed to Ma&apos;an and be stationed there indefinitely. Please reporthis reply.3. For your own information, if it turns out that the squadron is not allowedto go on from Aqaba to Ma&apos;an, it would be recalled at once to the Canal Zone.Looking further ahead, we should not be able to consider any invitation fromJordan to increase the armoured squadron up to an armoured regiment unless it was agreed that the regiment should be stationed in the Zerka area.4. Three weeks&apos; notice of the move is required in order to completeadministrative arrangements. If the Jordan Prime Minister confirms the under-standing in paragraph 2 above, you may therefore tell him that it will take a little time to complete preparations and that you will tell him later its expected dateof arrival.Draft Telegram to Tel AvivProvided that the Jordan Prime Ministers reply is acceptable, I shall wantyou to make a communication to the Israel Government shortly before the squadronis due to move.   You should inform them that:  (a) One British armoured squadron is being sent to Jordan for joint trainingin accordance with Article 6 of the Annex to the Anglo-Jordan Treaty.(b) As the Israel Government are aware, British troops in Jordan will in no circumstances be used for any aggressive purposes. The presence ofthis unit is likely to have a steadying effect in the area and by so doingis calculated to improve the general situation.(c) The Israel Government are no doubt aware of our obligation, underArticle 3 of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty, to come to the aid of Jordanif she is attacked.2. On receipt of final instructions you may make this communication by a semi-official letter as suggested in your telegram No. 378 of 12th December, 1953.
