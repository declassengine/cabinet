/CoCONFIDENTIALCABINET OFRCE fcCc.(54) 35 RECORD COPY copy no/30th january, 1954.cabinetCONCESSIONS TO MARRIED SERVICE MEN OVERSEASMemorandum by the Secretary of State for WarAbout a year ago I put up a memorandum to the Defence Committeeon this subject which was referred back for discussion with the Treasury.These discussions came to nothing and I again put up a paper in May lastyear.    This paper also led to nothing.2. Very briefly, the burden of these papers was as follows.Almost all fighting units of the Army are now overseas.    Before thewar half were in this country and half overseas; and the average officer or N.C.O. could tell pretty accurately where he was likely to be during hisoverseas service.    Furthermore, there were settled stations and largenumbers of married quarters or private accommodation were availableabroad.Today there is no stability,     80 per cent of the Army&apos;s fightingunits are overseas and there is e. higher proportion of married men.    Ofthe married men now serving overseas 66 per cent are separated from their wives.    Battalions which have just returned from their overseas tour ofthree years, often at a poor station for accommodation, are whisked off to kenya, British Guiana, Middle East, etc.    In most of these places thereare no married quarters.    The period for which the battalions remain isunpredictable.    There is one battalion which has moved no less than ninetimes between theatres since the end of the war.    Five battalions have beenin this country two months or less since the end of the last war.3. All this instability and separation is having a most serious effectcMany are leaving and still more intend to leave when, their engagement is completed.    Out of 64,000 soldiers serving on the old 5-years engagementon 1st January, 1953, 24,300 have now left the Army and only 4,700 haveprolonged their service.    What is more, these men should provide theimportant middle piece and senior NoC,00&apos;s and W. O. &apos;s who are the back-bone of the Army.    If this trend continues the Army will get into serious trouble.4. The normal peace-time code of allowances and conditions ofservice were not devised to meet the abnormal conditions and frequentchanges of station prevailing today.    If and when things settle down,many of the proposals which I now make will automatically lapse.    Theproblem cannot be solved in the way it should be in places like Kenya orEgypt, i. e. by building married quarters.
1^ I5, I have lived with and thought about this problem for over two years.Every Commander-in-Chief represents it as his greatest difficulty.     Forthe past year I have tried to get these concessions but I have failed.It is now my duty to warn the Cabinet that, after careful thought, I am convinced that these concessions must be made.    Such action will showthat we appreciate the difficulties of these men and the strain whichpresent conditions place on the Army.6. To do nothing will invite most serious consequences in the Army.If they are still withheld, the general standard of operational units willdecline markedly during the next few years, and in addition a fssr lowerstandard of training and supervision will be available during the early stages of National Service.     Furthermore, inaction now will almost certainly lead to a state of affairs in which the Government will be forcedto do something at a later date;  and because the situation will havedeteriorated, more drastic steps than those now proposed may well be needed,7. The total cost during 1954/55 would, for the Army alone, amountto about  650,000  -  a small sum compared with the proposed army estimates for the coming year of  561,000,000.Conclusion80 I invite the Cabinet to give general approval to the proposalslisted at Annex with a view to their introduction when I present theArmy Estimates.A.H0War Office, S.W.1,,29TH JANUARY, 1954.
1st.annex proposed CONCESSIONSCOST SAYING(Yearly)       (Yearly)1.   Home leave for married servicemenstationed in Germany and AustriaThis proposal is to allow married men serving in North-West Europe with their familiesto return along with their families, at public expense, to the United Kingdom for leave onceduring every three years of such service.The estimated cost is   88,0002.   Leave in the United Kingdom for un-accompanied me-rried men serving in the canal Zone and KenyaAt present men serving in the canal zone and in Kenya have no entitlement to travel to the United Kingdom at public expense for leave.Conditions at both stations are exeptional and although both the Canal Zone and East Africaare classed as &quot;family stations&quot; marriedaccommodation is for various unavoidablereasons so limited that most married men areinevitably separated for long periods from their families.    Many of the men should be servingat home but for the emergencies.The proposal would allow married menin the Canal Zone and Kenya separated from their families to come to the United Kingdom by aironce a year at public expense for a month&apos;sleave,,    The concession would not operateuntil a man had done 9 months&apos; service inthe theatre..The cost is  310,000against which there would bea saving of Local OverseasAllowance  30,0003*   Reduction of period of overseas service to qualify for family passages at public expenseAt present families cannot join their husbands at stations overseas (including North-West Europe) at public expense unless the husband has nine months still to serve at thestation.    The application of this rule,
is&quot;3&apos; COST SAVLNGparticularly to North-West Europe, is (Yearly) (Yearly)increasing the regrettably frequent separation of families brought about by cold-war conditions.This proposal would reduceunconditionally the qualifying period for north-West Europe to six months and allow a similar reduction for otherstations where accommodation was available at the C. in-C. &apos;s discretion.The estimated cost is   11,0004,   Schoolchildrens&apos; visits to parentsserving overseasEducational facilities for olderchildren are very limited at most overseasstations.    The married serviceman has there fore either to leave his wife at homewith the children during his overseas touror to take her with him leaving the children at boarding schools or with relations inthe United Kingdom.Under this proposal school children would be allowed to visit their parents atthe overseas station at public expense onceevery two years.The estimated cost is   45,0005.   Extension of rules governing the payment ofdisturbance allowance, removal expenses and storage chargesPresent rules may disqualify the married man,who is in present circumstances obliged to movehis family from place to place for service reasons,from being paid anything towards such moves.    Itis impossible to provide for all cases, but thefollowing proposals would g  a good way towardsensuring that the serviceman is not always out ofpocket as a result of having to move his family.(a) A storage allowance for furniturenecessarily stored while the familyis overseas,(b) Payment of disturbance allowance andremoval expenses, when the family has tovacate accommodation (e. g, married quarters) at the old station and has to occupy fresh accommodation in the UnitedKingdom because of the impossibility ofimmediately joining the husband overseas.
