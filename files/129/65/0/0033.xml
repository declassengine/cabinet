This prohibition will not, however, apply tothe forces of the High Contracting Parties or to genuinely Egyptian airorganisations or to air organisations genuinely belonging to any part of theBritish Commonwealth of Nations operating under the authority of theEgyptian Government.12. The Egyptian Government will provide when necessary reasonablemeans of communication and access to and from the localities where theBritish forces are situated, and will also accord facilities at Port Said andSuez for the landing and storage of material and supplies for the british forces, including the maintenance of a small detachment of the British forcesin these ports to handle and guard this material and these supplies in transit.13. In view of the fact that the speed and range of modern aircraftnecessitate the use of wide areas for the efficient training of air forces, theEgyptian Government will accord permission to the British air forces to flywherever they consider it necessary for the purpose of training. Reciprocaltreatment will be accorded to Egyptian air forces in British territories.14. In view of the fact that the safety of flying is dependent uponprovision of a large number of places where aircraft can alight, the egyptian government will secure the maintenance and constant availability of adequatelanding grounds and seaplane anchorages in Egyptian territory and waters.The Egyptian Government will accede to any request from the British airforces for such additional landing grounds and seaplane anchorages as experience may show to be necessary to make the numV&apos; adequate for allied requirements.15. The Egyptian Government will accord permission for the british air forces to use the said landing grounds and seaplane anchorages, and inthe case of certain of them to send stocks of fuel and stores thereto, to bekept in sheds to be erected thereon for this purpose, and in case of urgencyto undertake such work as may be necessary for the safety of aircraft.16. The Egyptian Government will give all necessary facilities for thepassage of the personnel of the British forces, aircraft and stores to andfrom the said landing grounds and seaplane anchorages Similar facilitieswill be afforded to the personnel, aircraft and stores of the Egyptian forcesat the air bases of the British forces.17. The British military authorities shall be at liberty to requestpermission from the Egyptian Government to send parties of officers in civilian clothes to the Western Desert to study the ground and draw uptactical schemes.   This permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.18.   His Majesty the King of Egypt authorises His Majesty The king and Emperor to maintain units of his forces at or near Alexandria for aperiod not exceeding eight years from the date of the coming into force of -the present treaty, this being the approximate period considered necessary by the two High Contracting Parties (a) For the final completion of the barrack accommodation in the canal zone;(6)(3) For the improvement of the roads (i) Cairo-Suez;(ii) Cairo-Alexandria via Giza and the desert;(iii) Alexandria-Mersa Matruh;so as to bring them up to the standard specified in part (A) ofparagraph 6;(c) The improvement of the railway facilities between Ismailia and alexandria, and Alexandria and Mersa Matruh referred to in (ii) and (iii)of part (B) of paragraph 6.(3) See note No. 2 on page 21.
The Egyptian Government will complete the work specified in (a), (b)and (r) above before the expiry of the period of eight years aforesaid. Theroads and railway facilities mentioned above will, of course, be maintained by the Egyptian Government.19. The British forces in or near Cairo shall, until the time for with-drawal under paragraph 8 above, and the British forces in or near Alexandriauntil the expiry of the time specified in paragraph 18 above, continue to enjoy the same facilities as at present.Article 9.The immunities and privileges in jurisdictional and fiscal matterslo be enjoyed by the forces of His Majesty The King and Emperorwho are in Egypt in accordance with the provisions of the presenttreaty will be determined in a separate convention (&apos;) to be concludedbetween the Egyptian Government and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom.Article 10.Nothing in the present treaty is intended to or shall in any wayprejudice the rights and obligations which devolve, or may devolve,upon either of the High Contracting Parties under the Covenant ofthe League of Nations or the Treaty for the Eenunciation of Warsigned at Paris on the 27th August, 1928. (5)Article 11.1. While reserving liberty to conclude new conventions in future,modifying the agreements of the 19th January and the 10th July,1899, the High Contracting Parties agree that the administration ofthe Sudan shall continue to be that resulting from the said agree-ments. The Governor-General shall continue to exercise on the jointbehalf of the High Contracting Parties the powers conferred upon him by the said agreements.The High Contracting Parties agree that the primary aim of their administration in the Sudan must be the welfare of the Sudanese.Nothing in this article prejudices the question of sovereignty overthe Sudan.2.(6) Appointments and promotions of officials in the Sudan will inconsequence remain vested in the Governor-General, who, in makingnew appointments to posts for which qualified Sudanese are notavailable, will select suitable candidates of British and Egyptiannationality.8. In addition to Sudanese troops, both British and Egyptiantroops shall be placed at the disposal of the Governor-General for thedefence of the Sudan.4.

- 1^annex to Article 11.1. Unless and until the High Contracting Parties agree to the contraryin application of paragraph 1 of this Article, the general principle for thefuture shall be that international conventions shall only become applicableto the Sudan by the joint action of the Governments of the United Kingdomand of Egypt, and that such joint action shall similarly also be required ifit is desired to terminate the participation of the Sudan in an international convention which already applies to this territory.2. Conventions to which it will be desired that the Sudan should be a party will generally be conventions of a technical or humanitarian character.Such conventions almost invariably contain a provision for subsequentaccession, and in such cases this method of making the convention applicableto the Sudan will be adopted. Accession will be effected by a joint instru-ment, signed on behalf of Egypt and the United Kingdom respectively by two persons duly authorised for the purpose. The method of depositing the instruments of accession will be the subject of agreement in each casebetween the two Governments. In the event of its being desirod to applyto the Sudan a convention which does not contain an accession clause, themethod by which this should be effected will be the subject of consultation and agreement between the two Governments.3. If the Sudan is already a party to a convention, and it is desired to terminate the participation of the Sudan therein, the necessary notice of termination will be given jointly by the United Kingdom and by Egypt.4. It is understood that the participation of the Sudan in a convention and the termination of such participation can only be effected by joint action specifically taken in respect of the Sudan, and does not follow merelyfrom the fact that the United Kingdom and Egypt are both parties to aconvention or have both denounced a convention.5. At international conferences where such conventions are negotiated,the Egyptian and the United Kingdom delegates would naturally keep intouch with a view to any action which they may agree to be desirable in theinterests of the Sudan.Article 12.His Majesty The King and Emperor recognises that the responsi-bility for the lives and property of foreigners in Egypt devolvesexclusively upon the Egyptian Government, who will ensure the fulfilment of their obligations in this respect.Article 18.His Majesty The King and Emperor recognises that the capitula-tory regime now existing in Egypt is no longer in accordance withthe spirit of the times and with the present state of Egypt.5. There shall be no discrimination in the Sudan between Britishsubjects and Egyptian nationals in matters of commerce, immigrationor the possession of property.6. The High Contracting Parties are agreed on the provisionsset out in the Annex to this Article as regards the method by whichinternational conventions are to be made applicable to the Sudan.
His Majesty the King of Egypt desires the abolition of this regimewithout delay.Both High Contracting Parties are agreed upon the arrangements with regard to this matter as set forth in the Annex to this Article.Annex to Article 13.1.   It is the object of the arrangements set out in this Annex:  (i) To bring about speedily the abolition of the Capitulations in Egyptwith the disappearance of the existing restrictions on Egyptiansovereignty in the matter or the application of Egyptian legislation(including financial legislation) to foreigners as its necessaryconsequence;(ii) To institute a transitional regime for a reasonable and not undulyprolonged period to be fixed, during which the Mixed Tribunals willremain and will, in addition to their present judicial jurisdiction,exercise the jurisdiction at present vested in the Consular Courts.At the end of this transitional period the Egyptian Government will be free to dispense with the Mixed Tribunals.2. As a first step, the Egyptian Government will approach theCapitulatory Powers as soon as possible with a view to (a) the removal ofall restrictions on the application of Egyptian legislation to foreigners,and (b) the institution of a transitional regime for the Mixed Tribunals as provided in paragraph 1 (ii) above.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, as the Governmentof a Capitulatory Power and as an ally of Egypt, are in no way opposed tothe arrangements referred to in the preceding paragraph and will collaborateactively with the Egyptian Government in giving effect to them by usingall their influence with the Powers exercising capitulatory rights in Egypt.4. It is understood that in the event of its being found impossible tobring into effect the arrangements referred to in paragraph 2, the egyptian government retains its full rights unimpaired with regard to the capitulatoryregime, including the Mixed Tribunals.5. It is understood that paragraph 2 (a) involves not merely that the assent of the Capitulatory Powers will be no longer necessary for theapplication of any Egyptian legislation to their nationals, but also thatthe present legislative functions of the Mixed Tribunals as regards theapplication of Egyptian legislation to foreigners will terminate. It would follow from this that the Mixed Tribunals in their judicial capacity would no longer have to pronounce upon the validity of the application to foreignersof an Egyptian law or decree which has been applied to foreigners by theEgyptian Parliament or Government, as the case may be.6. His Majesty the King of Egypt hereby declares that no Egyptianlegislation made applicable to foreigners will be inconsistent with theprinciples generally adopted in modern legislation or, with particular relationto legislation of a fiscal nature, discriminate against foreigners, includingforeign corporate bodies.7. In view of the fact that it is the practice in most countries to applyto foreigners the law of their nationality in matters of &quot; statut personnel,&quot;consideration will be given to the desirability of excepting from the transferof jurisdiction, at any rate in the first place, matters relating to &quot;statutpersonnel &quot; affecting nationals of those Capitulatory Powers who wish thattheir Consular authorities should continue to exercise such jurisdiction.8. The transitional regime for the Mixed Tribunals and the transfer tothem of the jurisdiction at present exercised by the Consular Courts (whichregime and transfer will, of course, be subject to the provisions of the specialconvention referred to in Article 9) will necessitate the revision of existinglaws relating to the organisation and jurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals,
including the preparation and promulgation of a new Code of criminal procedure. It is understood that this revision will include amongst othermatters:  (i) The definition of the word &quot; foreigner &quot; for the purpose of the futurejurisdiction of the Mixed Tribunals;(ii) The increase of the personnel of the Mixed Tribunals and the MixedParquet, which will be necessitated by the proposed extension oftheir jurisdiction;(iii) The procedure in the case of pardons or remissions of sentencesimposed on foreigners and also in connection with the execution ofcapital sentences passed on foreigners.Article 14.The present treaty abrogates any existing agreements or other instruments whose continued existence is inconsistent with its provisions. Should either High Contracting Party so request, a listof the agreements and instruments thus abrogated shall be drawnup in agreement between them within six months of the coming intoforce of the present treaty.Article 15.. The High Contracting Parties agree that any difference on thesubject of the application or interpretation of the provisions of thepresent treaty which they are unable to settle by direct negotiationshall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of theCovenant of the League of Nations.Article 16.At any time after the expiration of a period of twenty years fromthe coming into force of the treaty, the High Contracting parties will, at the request of either of them, enter into negotiations with aview to such revision of its terms by agreement between them asmay be appropriate in the circumsuances as they then exist. Incase of the High Contracting Parties being unable to agree upon theterms of the revised treaty, the difference will be submitted to theCouncil of the League of Nations for decision in accordance withthe provisions of the Covenant in force at the time of signature of thepresent treaty or to such other person or body of persons for decision in accordance with such procedure as the High Contracting Partiesmay agree. It is agreed that any revision of this treaty will providefor the continuation of the Alliance between the High ContractingParties in accordance with the principles contained in Articles 4, 5,6 and 7. Nevertheless, with the consent of both High ContractingParties, negotiations may be entered into at any time after theexpiration of a period of ten years after the coming into force of thetreaty, with a view to such revision as aforesaid.
Article 17.The present treaty is subject to ratification. Ratifications shallbe exchanged in Cairo as soon as possible. The treaty shall comeinto force on the date of the exchange of ratifications, and shall thereupon be registered with the Secretary-General of the League ofNations.In witness whereof the above-named plenipotentiaries have signed the present treaty and affixed thereto their seals.Done at London in duplicate this 26th day of August, 1986.(L.S.)
