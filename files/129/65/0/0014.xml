The agreement will last for 7 years from the date of its entry into force.3. The Canal Zone base and its contents will be maintained in efficient working order as a working base to supply and maintain in peace the forcessupported by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the Middle East and to be capableof immediate use in accordance with the following paragraph.4.   In the event of (a) an attack by an outside Power on Egypt;or(b) an attack by an outside Power on any country which is a party to theArab Mutual Security Pact;or(c) a recommendation by the United Nations that the base should be madeavailable in the event of a threat to the. peace, a breach of the peace or act of aggression;Egypt will afford to the United Kingdom all such facilities as may be necessaryto place the base on a war footing and operate it efficiently. These facilities will include the use within the limits strictly indispensable for the above-mentionedpurposes of the Egyptian ports by British forces.In the event of a threat of an attack on any members of the Arab MutualSecurity Pact, Iran or Turkey, there shall be immediate consultation between theUnited Kingdom and Egypt.5.   The organisation of the base will be in accordance with Annex 1 attached.6. The United Kingdom will be accorded full rights to move any Britishmaterial in or out of the base to any point and at any time at its discretion. Therewill be no major increase above the level of supplies existing at the time theagreement is signed without the consent of the Egyptian Government.7. Subject to the above arrangements, Her Majesty&apos;s forces will be with-drawn from Egyptian territory within a period of 15 months from the entry ofthis agreement into force.8. After the period of 15 months mentioned in paragraph 7 above, there willbe 4,000 British technicians for the remainder of the first % years of the agreement for the maintenance and running of the base.9. During the next 18 months the number of technicians shall graduallybe reduced to 2,500. Thereafter their numbers should not fall below one thousandduring the period covered by the agreement.10. Outside the base area and when off duty within it, British personnel willwear civilian clothes. When on duty in the base installations or in transit betweenthem they will normally wear working dress. However, the Egyptian Governmentaccepts in principle that they may wear Service uniform and that they will do sowhen so directed.  They may carry a weapon for their personal protection.
11. The parties will consult together at the end of the period specified forthe duration of the agreement to decide what arrangements are necessary toprovide for the continued maintenance of the base thereafter.12. The agreement will recognise that the Suez Maritime Canal is an integral part of Egypt and a waterway economically, commercially and strategically ofinternational importance and will express the determination of both parties touphold the 1888 Convention guaranteeing the freedom of navigation of the Canal.13.   Air matters are dealt with in Annex 2 attached.14. There will be many questions of detail to be covered in the drafting ofthe agreement, including the defence of the base, the storage of oil, the financial arrangements necessary, the status of the British personnel and their dependents,and other detailed matters of importance to both sides. These will be settled byfriendly agreement in negotiations which will begin forthwith.From Foreign Office to Washington(No. 129)January 9, 1954Draft Text of Annex 1Organisation of the BaseDuties of the Base Commander and Assistant Base CommanderUpon the conclusion of the agreement the Egyptian Government shall appoint a senior Egyptian officer as Base Commander (Designate).

From Foreign Office to Washington(No. 130)January 9, 1954Text of Annex 2Having regard to the need for:  (a) facilities for handling aircraft under Royal Air Force control connectedwith the movement of personnel and equipment required in themaintenance of the base;(b) facilities for handling aircraft under Royal Air Force control in transitthrough Egypt;provision will, be made for the use of a designated Egyptian Air Force airfield inthe Canal Zone at which Royal Air Force technicians will be employed for the move-ment, handling and servicing of British aircraft and for the necessary auxiliary services, and for the movement and control of personnel and freight. This includes provision for flying boats.2. The airfield will be under the command of an Egyptian Air Force officer,and would not necessarily be used exclusively by aircraft under Royal Air Forcecontrol. Egyptian airport authorities for immigration, health and customs will beprovided in accordance with international custom. British technicians would come under the command of the senior Royal Air Force officer in accordance with thegeneral principle governing the command and discipline of the British technicianswithin the whole of the Base.3. All movements of aircraft under Royal Air Force control will requireclearance in accordance with procedures which shall be agreed from time to time.4. Overflying rights will be accorded to aircraft under Royal Air Force controlsubject to notifications in accordance with procedures which shall also be agreedfrom time to time.APPENDIX BFrom Cairo to Foreign Office(No. 36)January 10, 1954From Delegation:  We note that, with the exceptions of the numbers of technicians in the last2\ years and certain points in the paper on the duties of the base commander,Foreign Office text repeats in detail and not merely in general substance our offer of October 21.2. It seems to us arguable that it would be better tactics with the americans to introduce a slight change of emphasis reflecting subsequent informal contacts with the Egyptians. On the other hand, Her Majesty&apos;s Government may feel thatour attitude must remain manifestly unchanged since October.3. As regards numbers of technicians (paragraph 9 of Foreign Office telegramNo. 128), the Egyptians showed signs of accepting ceiling figures of 3,000 and1,500 respectively (Cairo telegram to Foreign Office No. 1751, paragraph 4), andwe also mentioned tapering off at the end of each period. We would much prefer to stick to ceiling figures and thus to. avoid, giving the impression that we are now seeking to prolong the period for the 4,000 technicians. Moreover, it might indeed prove awkward to us administratively if we were obliged to maintain aminimum number of 1,000 until the last day of the seventh year. We thereforeurge that paragraph 9 should read: &quot; During the next 18 months the number oftechnicians shall not exceed 3,000 and for the final year of the agreement 1,500.&quot;
4. If it is thought advisable to give the Americans the impression that we areprepared to take into account Egyptian difficulties, where this does not involve anysurrender of points of substance, we would suggest the following:  (a) Use of title &quot; Commander British Technical Staff.&quot;(b) The shortened form of the air provisions (Cairo telegram No. 1759 toForeign Office).(c) Some mention of use of the base in the support of Arab forces, e.g., byamending paragraph 3 of Foreign Office telegram No. 128 to you to read: &quot; Maintain in peace British forces in the Middle East and Arabforces aided or supported by Her Majesty&apos;s Government and to be capable, &amp;c.&quot;(d) Amendment of consultation clause.   (Paragraph 11 Foreign Office tele-gram No. 128 to you) to read: &quot; The parties will consult together duringthe last year of the period specified for the duration of the agreement to decide what arrangements are necessary upon its conclusion.&quot;(Cairo telegram No. 1751 to Foreign Office, paragraph 3.)5. We note that the October availability clause is maintained including the mention of &quot; a recommendation by the United Nations that the base should bemade available in the event of a threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression.&quot; The Americans have said to us and to the Egyptians that theyconsider that a specific recommendation of this kind by the United Nations is sounlikely to be agreed in a moment of crisis that the Egyptians could safely overlookits possibility and accept the clause. The Americans have also gone so far already in aiding the Egyptians to whittle away this clause to a meaningless mention ofthe United Nations involving no firm obligation that we have felt it wiser in recentconversations to concentrate on the &quot; global war &quot; approach. If Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment agree with this we would strongly recommend substitution of formulain Cairo telegram No- 1694 to Foreign Office. Our own view is that the Egyptiansare unlikely to accept much more than a formula on the lines of that in paragraph 2of Cairo telegram No. 1767 to Foreign Office.6. We note that &quot; defence of the base &quot; is included in paragraph 14 of ForeignOffice telegram No. 128 to you as one of the questions of detail. We understandthat this in fact means &quot; military aid to the Egyptian forces &quot; and we strongly recommend the substitution of that phrase for the existing one which wouldcertainly be regarded by the Egyptians as constituting a hitherto undiscloseddemand.7. There are one or two quite minor textual points (see my immediately following telegram), in Annex 1 on duties of base commander.From Cairo to Foreign Office(No. 37)January 10, 1954My immediately preceding telegram.Following are minor points arising in text in Foreign Office telegram No. 129to you:  Paragraph 2 (B). Text received here corrupt. Reference in bracketsshould read: &quot; as defined in paragraph 3 below.&quot;Paragraph 3 (D). We have provisionally agreed with Egyptians (Cairotelegram No. 1759 heading 1 (J) the phrase; &quot;He will be responsible to the base Commander for the adequate training of Egyptian personnel etc.&quot;Paragraph 5 (B)--Egyptians proposed &quot;Ambassador of the UnitedKingdom.&quot; We consider that the correct title should be: &quot; Her Majesty&apos;sDiplomatic representative for the United Kingdom.&quot;
