secret.(54) 3027TH JANUARY, 1954CABINETJAPAN;  TRADE WITH THE STERLING area memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI feel I should inform my colleagues of the decision I propose totake in regard to imports into the United Kingdom of Japanese cotton textilesin the form of grey cloth for processing and re-export.2.        My colleagues will recall that, when the Chancellor reported on29th December on the progress of the current negotiations with the Japaneseon trade and payments, they agreed that we should offer a quota for thisyear of up to  2 millions worth of Japanese grey cloth for re-export(C.C. (53) 81st Conclusions, Minute 7).3.        The negotiations proceeded satisfactorily and last week we werewithin sight of an agreement which, inter alia, will guarantee our exports to japan, including oil and wool textiles, in return for concessions in theColonial and United Kingdom quotas.    In order to handle the obviouspolitical difficulties in Lancashire in the best possible way, I undertook toinform certain leaders of the cotton and rayon industries in strict confidence of the quotas, so that they should not be taken by surprise ifthe news of our concession &quot;leaked&quot; in Tokyo.    I did so and, as expected,they expressed grave dissatisfaction about our intention to admit 2 millions worth of Japanese textiles for re-export.4.        Since then, however, the East African Governments have unexpectedlyreduced by  2. 5 millions the amount of trade they will license from Japan.They have decided to do so because of large orders for textiles which theirtraders have placed with the United Kingdom.5.        The total amount of trade between the sterling area and Japan isabout  200 millions each way and a reduction of  2. 5 millions in one country may not seem significant.    But the Japanese attach considerable importance to their textile trade in the Colonies and their reaction to this last-minute change was to ask our negotiators to increase by  1 million theUnited Kingdom quota for grey cloth for re-export.6,        On balance, and because it is desirable that the agreement with theJapanese should be signed to-morrow,&apos; I think we should agree to theJapanese proposal, and I have told those few people in Lancashire who were informed of the earlier proposal of this proposed change.7.        I recommend that we now decide to increase the quota for greycloth from  2 millions to  3 millions.    We should, however, be under noillusion about the amount of criticism which we shall get from Lancashirefor this action.P.T.CABINET OFFICE / /RECORD CQpySQPY NQ&apos; fejgBoard of Trade, S.W.1.27TH JANUARY, 1954.
