Copy No.   g tyCABINETBRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION: INCREASE IN charges memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation.;/ The British Transport Commission have applied for my authority to increase as from 1st February existing railway freight, dock and canal charges by 10 percent., subject in the case of railway freight charges generally to a limit of1 ().v. a ton.2.   They propose to announce this on Tuesday next.  By the Transport Act,1947 I am required to refer any such application to the Permanent Members of theTransport Tribunal, acting as a Consultative Committee, for their advice..   This I have done.3. The case of the Commission is based on increases in expenses alreadyincurred and on other increased charges that will arise this year. These include 6 million for the recent Wages Award of 45. a week. These estimates take no account of increases in wages which are certain to result from the current talks between the Commission and the Unions.I attach without comment a paper setting out in greater detail the case as presented by the Commission.&quot; 4. I will submit a further paper as soon as I have received the advice of theTransport Tribunal.&quot; A. L-B.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation,Berkeley Square House, W.l,1st January, 1954.45429Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1954secret   &apos;    - CABINET CPFiOSSc. (54)1 .     &apos; &apos; ^ECORD GOPY1st January, 1954
annex the British Transport Commission have applied for my authority to increase,as from 1st February, existing railway freight, dock and canal charges, by 10 percent., subject, in the case of railway freight charges generally, to a limit of 10s. aton. This would, in broad figures, increase railway freight charges from 130 percent, to 153 per cent, above pre-war, the principal dock charges from 154 per cent,to 179 per cent above pre-war and the principal canal charges from 122 per cent, to144 per cent, above pre-war. The net yield is estimated at  23 million from rail-ways and  1-5 million from docks and canals.2. The Commission estimate that, in a future year, they will have to meetcentral charges of  55 - 5 million and that, at present charges but allowing for the4s. a week wages increase, their net receipts will be only  30-3 million. The increasein charges applied for is to meet this short-fall of  25-2 million.3. The Commission have given a possible target allocation of central charges.Taking together their services other than railways, docks and canals, they estimate that net receipts at present charges will be about  1 - 5 million less than the amountallocated for central charges. The estimated receipts from docks and canals wouldbe  0-7 million less than the amount allocated for central charges. On all services other than railways, therefore, the short-fall would be  2-2 million and of this 1 - 5 million would be made good by the proposed increase in dock and canalcharges. The Commission are also considering whether additional revenue can beobtained from London Transport. On railways, however, the estimated net receiptsat present charges are  16-5 million, the amount allocated for central charges is 39-5 million and the short-fall is  23 million.4. When charges were last increased, it was estimated that the net receipts from railways would be  37-9 million in a year. The amount allocated to railwaysfor central charges was  37 - 5 million out of a total of  54 million. This total hasnow been increased to  55 - 5 million because the Commission^ cash resources arerapidly diminishing and provision has been made for a substantial issue of Com-mission stock early in 1954 with a consequential increase in interest payable. Therehas also been an adjustment in the allocation of central charges, particularly tomeet the progressive disposal of the bulk of the Commission^ road haulage under-taking. As a result of these factors, the amount allocated to railways for centralcharges has been increased by  2 million, making  39 - 5 million in all.5.   The following increases in expenses have already occurred:    MillionIncrease in coal and steel prices............... 4-other variations in prices................... 20Increase in depreciation due mainly to higher prices    ...... 1-0Effect of charging to revenue actual maintenance expenditure onlocomotives and carriages      ............... 6-013-3There have, however, been improvements in efficiency and other factors affectingexpenditure, and in traffics. The Commission have allowed, in their futureestimates,  4-4 million for the former and  5-2 million for the latter, a total of 9-6 million. The net deterioration is therefore  3-7 million.6. The position in 1954 will be adversely affected by the following additionalitems:    MillionCost of pension scheme ( 2 - 5 million in full year)       ......       1-2Cost of December 1953 wages&apos; award    ............       6-5Abolition of &quot; standard charge&quot; for maintenance as from 1st January, 1954       ..................      10-0
7. The effect of the various items in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 is to convert an estimated surplus of  0-4 million into an estimated deficit of  23 million.8. The increased charge arising from the abolition of the &quot; standard charge &quot;for maintenance calls for explanation. Since the Commission began operations in1948, there has been substantial abnormal expenditure on maintenance, which couldnot be separated from normal maintenance expenditure. The Commission have therefore followed the practice, adopted during Government control of railways,of charging to revenue a &quot; standard charge &quot; based on the expenditure in pre-war years suitably adjusted, and charging the excess of actual expenditure incurredagainst their Abnormal Maintenance Fund of  150 million provided by the Govern-ment at the end of the war. It is estimated that this Fund is now less than 50 million and this in the opinion of the Commission is required for other purposes.The Commission had already decided and stated in their Report for 1952 thatin future they would charge to revenue all maintenance expenditure as incurred.The additional burden may be as much as  15 million next year, but the commission have based their estimates on the lower figure of  10 million.9. The Commission regard their estimates as optimistic and provisional. Theyassume a continuation of the present high levels of traffic, in spite of road corn-petition. They make no allowance for increases in prices due to wage increases in other industries, or for the extent to which the Commission may be unable to recoup, out of increased economy and efficiency, the further increases in wages tobe granted to their own workers. They make no allowance for the substantialtrading losses which might be incurred by the Commission^ road haulage services during the disposal period or from any losses arising out of the disposals. TheCommission think, therefore, that they may be obliged perhaps by the middleof 1954 to apply for a further increase in charges.10. The Commission see little hope of any substantial contribution frompassengers on British Railways. They may be able to reduce services which arepoorly patronised, to change the form of operation on secondary lines and to makeselective increases in local fares. Long-distance fares cannot, however, be increased in the face of road competition. Indeed such fares may have to be reduced to meetthat competition and the effect of such reductions may offset the benefits of thelocal measures indicated above.
