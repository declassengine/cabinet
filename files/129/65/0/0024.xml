secret. (54) 24275? January, 1954Copy No. 0 3CABINET, OFF-ICe,..RECORD COPYCABINETPROPOSAL TO INVITE THE CHINESE TO ATTEND THEBRITISH INDUSTRIES FAIRMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the last occasion on which the Board of Trade issued invitations to Chinesebusinessmen and others to attend the British Industries Fair (B.I.F.) was in 1951.In 1952 no Chinese were invited for the practical reason that due to Communistmeasures the existing list of Chinese business houses was largely useless. In 1953,although no specific invitations had been sent, three Chinese visitors from the mainland of China visited the Fair.2. Invitations are issued to state-trading organisations of the Soviet Union andthe Eastern European satellites. They are sent through the commercial represen-tatives of their Embassies in London, and the numbers attending the Fair have been satisfactory.3. .Should we invite the Chinese to visit the Fair in May of this year? Suchinvitations could either be issued direct to those Chinese Government purchasingagencies whose addresses are known, or alternatively Her Majest&apos;y&apos;s Charged&apos;Affaires might be instructed to distribute them to these bodies.4.   The arguments against inviting the Chinese are:  (a) Little actual trade might result: China is spending her available foreign exchange mainly on capital goods for her Five-Year development programme, and the majority of these are on the embargo list at present.(b) The issue of invitations might receive publicity and arouse unfavourablereactions in the United States at a time when there are indications thatthe Americans may be becoming less rigid in their views on trade with china.(c) There is no immediate prospect of a political settlement in the Far East andit is declared policy that there can be no real relaxation of controls on trade with China until this happens.(d) Any disagreement with the United States over China trade might prejudice the efforts we may be making to adopt more liberal policies on the mainbulk of East/West trade with countries other than China.5.   The arguments in favour are:  (a) As has frequently been stated in the House, it is the policy of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to encourage trade with China in non-strategic goods.(b) Questions have been, and will be, asked about what steps Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment are taking to encourage such trade; this is positive actionwhich we might well take and we should be open to criticism if we didnot take it.(c) All other Communist countries are invited to attend, and discrimination against China would not now be easy to justify or defend.45545Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1954U-u .  .
(d) The British Council for the Promotion of International Trade (B.C.P.I.T.)is encouraging British firms to exhibit at the Leipzig Fair, to enableChinese visitors to see their products. The political propaganda whichthis makes possible could best be countered by a direct invitation to theChinese to visit the B.I.F.; (e) It would afford the Chinese an opportunity of seeing for themselves whatBritish manufacturers have to offer, and to that extent would divertenquiries from undesirable channels such as the B.C.P.I.T. and itsassociated bodies.6. These arguments are nicely balanced. On the whole I believe the difficultyof explaining why we refuse to invite a country, which we have recognised, to visita Fair for the purpose of doing trade which we permit, is harder than the task of defending the invitation against any American criticism. I accordingly comedown, though rather narrowly, in favour of inviting the Chinese Governmentpurchasing agencies to attend the B.I.F. in May.P. T.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,20th January, 1954.
