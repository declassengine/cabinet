The Indian Government are pressing us to let them know whether we can supply some 3 00 tanks.    They are thinking of either Centurions orCharioteers and have mentioned the possibility of taking them at the rateof 80 tanks a year over a period of four years.    They have also enquired ofHawkers for a licence to assemble Hunger fighters in India from 1956onward - with complete engines from the United Kingdom - preceded by the delivery of 25 complete aircraft in 1955.    I understand that, from the pointof view of supply and production, we can meet these requirements.3.        I explained in D. (53) 62 the general considerations we must bearin mind at the present time in examining requests from India for defence equipment.    We must assume that the motives of the Indian Governmentare mixed and are not wholly unrelated to the possibility that Pakistan will receive military aid from the United States.4.        On the other hand:-(a)   These are genuine requirements on the part of the indian army and Air Force.    It is only prudent and realisticthat they should be thinking now of planning a re-equipment programme.    The Army are at present equipped with out-of-date Sherman tanks and the Air Force will be ready forHunter class fighters by 1955/56.(b) Apart from the money involved, acceptance of the Indianorders would help us from the point of view of maintainingessential defence production.(c) It now seems certain that in some form or other the UnitedStates will grant military aid to Pakistan.    This will undoubtedly put a strain on Indian relations with pakistan and with the United States.    Our High Commissioner haswarned us that there will also be very sharp reactionsagainst us if we make available, as we shall wish to,United Kingdom equipment for off-shore purchase under united States military aid for Pakistan.    It is very desirable to avoid putting a further strain on Indianfeelings.    A refusal to supply tanks or aircraft would be
1*known to be deliberate and Indian reactions would be correspondingly bitter.    We could not conceal from india that tanks are available to countries other thanthe &quot;old&quot; Commonwealth and the North atlantic alliance;  we are selling Centurions to Sweden and thepossibility of supplies to Switzerland and the Argetineis under consideration.    It is well known that Hunterswill be in full production by 1955/56.(d)    Apart from financial and production advantages, thereare general benefits to us in keeping India to UnitedKingdom equipment.    The French are keen to supplyaircraft and last year were successful in securing anorder from India for Ouragan fighters^    It is doubtfulwhether the Indians could secure immediate supplies of tanks from elsewhere, but the United States will shortlyhave a large disposable surplus, and might very likelyjump in with an offer.    Refusal would certainly encourage the Indians to go elsewhere for other supplies where weare in competition with foreign countries.5.        The Pakistanis told us some time ago that they would be interestedin the supply of some 350 Centurions over a period of three years from1955/56, and we told them that there should be no difficulty in our meetingsuch an order.    We have heard nothing further from Pakistan, possiblybecause they are not certain that they can find the money for such a largeorder.   I would expect their interest to be renewed if and when they secureaid from the United States.    We have agreed to Pakistan purchasing Swiftfighters with deliveries at the rate of one a month from November, 1955, to .February, 1957, and thereafter at the rate of two a month.6.        We have in India and Pakistan two actual and potential customersfor arms and equipment who are both members of the Commonwealth, and both of whom We should like to see wellequipped from United Kingdomsources on a scale related to the areas they must defend, their population and their ability to buy.    The principle of &quot;broad parity of treatment&quot; inresponding to requests for supply, based as it is upon the jealousy andenmity existing at present between these two members of the Commonwealth,is extremely difficult to apply in the face of these disparities incomparative financial strength.    If we supply these substantial Indianrequirements we should be morally committed to making supplies availableto Pakistan from off-shore purchases based on American aid and could properly ignore any Indian protests.    It is very important that India and pakistan should both look to the United Kingdom for military equipment;and the more they rely on us for this, the more likely we are to maintain our position as the principal supplier of their civil requirements as well.Re commendation7.        My conclusion is that we should tell the Indians that we can meet their requirements (paragraph 2 above).    If we do not we shall be laying our-selves open to the accusation of attempting ,to cripple the Indian Army andAir Force, and the Indian Government will probably obtain supplies else-where.    The order for tanks, however^ would presumably be accepted on thebasis that, for production reasons, actual deliveries Would not start for,say, six months and would proceed at the rate of approximately eighty ayear.   As between Centurions and Charioteers the Supply departments should decide which would better suit our interests.SWINTONCommonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,6TH JANUARY, 1954,
