Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1954CONFIDENTIAL : &apos;l-T C;-Oi. - Copy No. g9c.(54)4 ^:::--R GO.BP&apos;GOPY&apos;.:, &quot;5th January, 1954 nuii y %cabinet united STATES PROJECT TO ASSOCIATE MILITARY AID to pakistan WITH MIDDLE EAST defence memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in October 1953 the Pakistan Commander-in-Chief succeeded in convincing theUnited States authorities that there was a strong case for granting a limited amount (about $25 million) of United States military aid to Pakistan. In spite of advice from Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom on the need forsecrecy, this project soon became public knowledge and created great resentmentin India, where it was represented as involving the Indian sub-continent in the cold war. Indian resentment was probably heightened by groundless rumours thatPakistan would give the United States bases and possibly an alliance in return forthis-aid. The Indian Government have recently been conducting a major campaign against the project and have made representations to the United States Government,Her Majesty&apos;s Government and other Commonwealth Governments. China andthe Soviet Union have also protested to Pakistan.2. Surprised and embarrassed by the intensity of Indian hostility, the UnitedStates Government have been seeking ways of mitigating Indian resentment.Their latest idea, on which they have acted without prior consultation with her majesty&apos;s Government, is an attempt to link their offer of military aid to Pakistanwith the initiation of some kind of military collaboration between Pakistan and turkey, which might develop into some system of collective defence in the middle east. The U.S. Ambassador in Ankara has told the Turkish Government ofthe proposed military aid for Pakistan and suggested that the Turks should propose military conversations to Pakistan. What is suggested is not a treaty of alliance, but some form of joint planning in which other Middle Eastern states,particularly Iraq and eventually Persia, might later take part but from which theUnited States and other Western powers would be excluded. The State Departmenthope that the Governments of Turkey and Pakistan might announce their decisionto start such military conversations, Such an announcement would provide theUnited States Government with a suitable occasion for announcing their owndecision to grant military aid to Pakistan. The Turkish Prime Minister^ initialreaction to this suggestion is understood to have been favourable.3. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are, of course, much concerned to promote an effective system of Middle Eastern defence, but the State Departments projectseems unlikely to have useful or practical results. Indeed, for the following reasons,it would probably be positively harmful:  (a) It explicitly excludes Western participation and thus makes no real contri-bution to the security of the region.(b) It will raise doubts about the role which the West (and Britain inparticular) can be counted on to play in the defence of the area, and make the Middle East states less ready to accept realistic proposals.45448
(c) Turkey and Pakistan are too far apart for effective military co-operation and the k&apos;Taatui;al^role isitoVdefei^^entirelyivseparate sectors of the global front.(d) Only planning, without an alliance or commitments, is envisaged.   Thiswill not of itself effectively strengthen Middle Eastern defences and will- -. ** only be ostentatiously provocative to the Soviet Union in au area where she is traditionally sensitive.   If Persia were later to be included, she would only be a liability and an increased provocation.        &amp;       -i4. I would accordingly suggest to my colleagues that the United.xStatesGovernment should, if possible, be discouraged from pursuing this project in itspresent form. I propose to instruct H.M. Ambassador in Washington accordingly.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,4th January, 1954.
