A NATIONAL OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH scheme memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the time has come to promote a National Occupational Health Scheme as a major piece of Government policy.  This is desirable in itself, and would, in my. opinion, also have political advantages. - *2. I am being strongly pressed by the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) notonly to extend existing measures but also to take steps to co-ordinate what is being done in agriculture, the mines, transport and docks, factories, shops and offices, andto develop a comprehensive scheme. There is no doubt about the strength of theT.U.C.&apos;s feeling that the health of the worker in his place of employment has not received the attention it deserves, and about their intention to press this issue as one on which, they will say, the Government has failed.3.  Proposals for an Occupational Health Service were also discussed at theLabour Party Conference and the Opposition^ interest in the extension of these -measures was indicated in the debate on the Address.   .4. The British Medical Association has recently submitted to me proposals forthe development by the Government of a co-ordinated occupational health scheme,which follow in many respects the proposals in this paper.5. At the time of the introduction of the National Health Service, the white paper of 1944 (Cmd. 6502) made clear that this was only one part of the provisionfor health that supervision of industrial conditions with appropriate medicalparticipation was another sphere of great importance intimately bound up with industrial organisation and welfare. It said that a comprehensive health service &quot; has to comprehend all kinds of personal health treatment and medical- advice. But that does not mean that there should be no other government or private activity involving the use of the medical expert or having anybearing upon health. There are many specialised and separate forms of under-taking such as the supervision of industrial conditions which may affect health and which may require the medical expert as much as they require theengineering or legal or any other expert, but which cannot simply for that reason be regarded as necessarily part of the personal health service ....From the point of view of industrial organisation, of working conditions infactory, mine and field, there is a continuing and specialised need for enlistingmedical skill in ensuring a proper working environment, a proper allocation of types of work to the individual worker&apos;s capacity, a proper standard ofworking hygiene and a general protection of the worker&apos;s welfare. Theenlistment of medical help for these purposes is part of the complex machineryof industrial organisation and welfare and it belongs to that sphere more than. the sphere of the personal doctor and the care of personal health which centres....   pn the individual and his family and his home.&quot;.It was envisaged that developments in this sphere would take their proper placein post-war reconstruction, and it is clear that such an occupational service wouldhave to be correlated with the National Health Service....     45474 ,. .        ,       ,   .... ,Printed for the Cabinet.

6. Again the Dale Committee on Industrial Health Services (Cmd. 8170of 1951) said in paragraph 26: &quot;The industrial health services which make a callon medical man-power are part of the general preventive health service connected,With work and work-places. Industrial health services are indeed not whollymedical in character but they are bound up with the carrying out of certainfunctions largely non-medical at the place of work.&quot;7. Internationally this subject was dealt with at the 1953 International LabourConference from which there emerged a Recommendation on the protection ofthe Health of workers at their places pf employment whose scope embraced (i) Technical measures, including-cleanliness, space, lighting, ventilation,sanitation, washing facilities, clothing, accommodation for  meals,reduction of noise, storage of dangerous substances, regulation of,    ^     hazardous processes, control of dust and fumes, protective clothing.(ii) Medical examination in occupations involving special risks.(iii) Notification of occupational disease with a view to prevention and protec-tion, and investigation of working conditions.(iv) Provision for First Aid and emergency treatment at the place off . .     .   employment.&quot;c 8. These pronouncements confirm that provision for occupational healthconsists of environmental measures to ensure that workers carry on their occupa-tions in physical conditions of sanitation, heat, light, ventilation, atmosphere andcleanliness which are conducive to good health; of protection against risk of disease and poisoning from the nature of materials and processes used; of medical super-vision including periodical examination by a doctor experienced in occupationalhealth for young people and those exposed to special risk, to ensure initial and continued fitness for the employment concerned; of limitation of the hours of workof women and young persons, and, finally, of first aid should an accident or injuryoccur at work.9. Much is already being done in the field of occupational health under the factories Acts, Mines and Quarries Acts and other legislation; much remains tobe done. The recommendations of the Gowers Report for legislation for shops and offices, agriculture and railways are being worked out. The Dale Committee&apos;srecommendations for the development of industrial health services remain to be implemented; international recommendations await consideration. These responsi-rbilities are spread amongst a number of Departments and need pulling together.10. I should now like to take a major step forward and place a scheme on thefollowing lines before the National Joint Advisory Council and other interested bodies for their consideration (1) The establishment, under my chairmanship, of an Occupational HealthAdvisory Council to advise Ministers on all aspects of occupationalhealth services and their development.This Council would consist of representatives of the british employers&apos; Confederation, the nationalised industries, the T.U.C.,medical and nursing organisations and Local Health Authorities withrepresentatives of Government Departments in attendance.(2) The establishment of an Inter-departmental Co-ordinating Committee ofthe various Government Departments concerned (see Appendix) to ;       (i) co-ordinate Government policy on matters of occupational health;&apos;; (ii) keep under review the progress of legislation in the sphere of occupational health;(iii) review from time to time the efficacy of existing legislation and theprospect of further measures in the light, of international.&apos;: . regulations and agreements, available resources and the evidence as to the need for such.development;(iv) arrange as may he desirable for Regional or Local surveys experi-&apos;ments or other developments which cover the needs of more than. one Department11. Among the immediate matters on which early action should be takenare:  (i) The intensification of present environmental measures to secure improve-ment in health in places of work.
(ii) The pressing forward with the necessary consultations in connection withthe recommendations in the Gowers Report relating to shops and offices, agriculture and railways,(in) The stimulation of the voluntary provision of occupational health services by employers in industrial and non-industrial occupations as recom-mended by the Dale Committee, and with this in view, the carrying outof surveys to determine the kind of work places and the particular workplaces which, by reason of the existing conditions, are most in need of aworks&apos; doctor and/or nurses either full time or part time; also the carrying out of experiments with a view to evolving a satisfactory groupservice to provide medical supervision for small work places within alocalised area.12. The cost of the main proposal for an occupational health scheme would belimited to the small additional administrative costs of the co-ordination work andthe servicing of the two Committees proposed. Other costs would depend upondecisions of policy to be made as to progress under the various items listed as of current concern, though it would be necessary to recognise that there would be acertain impulse towards quicker progress.13. I ask for authority to proceed with what I believe will be regarded as asignal advance in our social services.W.
