CABINET office record COPY8TH FEBRUARY.  1Q5UCABINETKENYADETENTION OF SUPPORTERS OF MAU MAUMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the PoloniesThe present situation in Kenya requires that more effectivesteps should be taken to neutralise the passive supporters ofMau Mau and,  in particular, the large number of unemployedKikuyu who have drifted into Nairobi.    They form most of theex-iminal element in the city and are ready converts to Mau Mau.Amongst other things steps must be taken which will increasesubstantially the number of persons to be held on Governorfsdetention orders.    Since there is nothing more demoralisingthan to be shut up with nothing to do, it is intended to employ such persons compulsorily.    The work will not be penalor oppressive and I propose to lay it down that market rates ofwages will be paid.    Under existing Emergency Regulations it is open to the Governor to declare any detention camp a specialdetention camp for rehabilitation purposes and the persons inthose camps can be required to work.2D      Circumstances such as these&apos;were not foreseen when theForced Labour Convention of 1930, to which Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Kenya Government, have adhered, was drawnup;    it is not clear whether the action proposed in thepreceding paragraph would be a breach of that Convention.It can be argued that the exemptions provided in the convention in case of emergency would cover:what is proposed.    It can,however, certainly be argued also that they do not and thata technical breach of the Convention would be involved.    Inany case extensive use of the emergency powers in the wayproposed would be likely to give rise to international and parliamentary criticism.    Commenting on similar regulations in force in Malaya, the United Nations Ad Hoc Cornmi-otee onForced Labour (1953) said that such&apos;powers &quot;if broadlyinterpreted and extensively applied, could lead to a system offorced labour as a means of political coercion&quot;.    Short of complete denunciation of the Convention by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, there is no escape from the obligations under theConvention.    A breach of the Council of Europe Convention on human Rights is also probably involved;    Article 15 permitsderogations from the obligations accepted in time of publicemergencyp but only so far as may be consistent with &quot;other obligations under International law.&quot;The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of..^W^^-..^/.r^Sk^m^TOP SECRET Copy No..&quot;   i.....-
3o      I am satisfied however that the situation in Kenyarequires that the breach, if such it is, he accepted andjustified on the grounds that,(i)    we are dealing with exceptional circumstancesnot contemplated by the Convention;(ii)    we are not offending against the spirit ofthe Convention which was framed primarily to prevent the exploitation of labour;(iii) the measures taken are emergency measures and will be rescinded as soon as normalconditions have been restored.ho     Copies of the relevant telegraphic correspondence withthe Kenya Government are attached.    I now seek endorsement of the policy proposed.O.L.Colonial Office, S.W.1.8TH FEBRUARY,  I95I+.ANNEXTelegram No. 72 dated 27th January. 195^4-from the Governor of Kenya to theSecretary of State for the ColoniesCommander-in-Chief has presented. &quot;Appreciation on theFuture Military Policy in Kenya 195V and I hope to send youcopy very shortly.    Appreciation emphasises that any militaryplan adopted must not prejudice the long-term political policy for Kenya and, after reviewing the whole situation, concludes,since infliction of crippling casualties on the enemy is notpossible in conditions in which the security forces have to operate against Mau Mau, certain drastic administrative measures are urgently necessary in support of military action if the Emergency is to be brought to an end.20      Chief of these are:(a) Large-scale detention of Kikuyu on suspicion asa prophylactic measure, i.e. change in presentdetention practice.(b) By 1st April clean-up of Nairobi by:-(i)    evacuation of all Kikuyu, Meru andEmbu from Nairobi and theirdetention;    or(ii)    alternatively, the evacuation and&apos; detention of all unemployed orsuspected Kikuyu, etc. from theCity,
(c) Provision of inaccessible and distant detentioncamps with capacity of 100,000 persons and capable of expansion,(d) After clean-up of Nairobi, removal of all or part of Kikuyu labour from the settled areas.(e) Reorganisation of higher Emergency control into;-(i)   Tbp-Level Emergency Cabinet consistingof Governor, Commander--in-Chief,Deputy Governor and possibly Blundell0(ii)    Small executive body based on, but smaller than,, present Colony Emergency committee with Crawford as Chairman and Hinde asExecutive Officer,,(iii)    Emergency Secretariat on the lines ofCabinet Secretariat to secure liaisonand co-ordination between departments of the Government and Branches of theGeneral Headquarters.(iv)    Formation of ad hoc Working Parties toproduce plans for such matters as&apos;detention camps, Nairobi clean-up,sanctions and reorganisation in theKikuyu reserves, etc.(f) Build-up of the Home Guard so that they and thepolice can take over areas to be   vacated bythe military.(g) A number of measures for stricter administrativediscipline in the reserves and in Nairobi City.3.      Generally, I agree that present somewhat static situationrequires drastic action if the end of the Emergency is to be expedited and the danger of spreading Mau Mau to other tribesavoided, and that clean-up of Nairobi and build-up of Kikuyuguard (now being undertaken) are particularly important.    I also agree entirely with the need for reorganisation of thehigher Emergency control on the broad lines of paragraph 2(e)above, so as to ensure the maximum liaison between the militaryand the civil authorities in what is after all difficult corn-bined operation against an impalpable and numerous enemy, and proposals are the result of discussion between Erskine and me.I4.0      I doubt, however, whether detention of as many as100,000 Kikuyu. is feasible or would produce good results and could not agree to indiscriminate expulsion and detention efall Kikuyu, Meru and Embu from Nairobi (paragraph (b) (i)above). Latter may have some immediate sectirity advantagesbut would, in my opinion, prejudice any future solution forthe Nairobi-based loyalists (as in the reserves) and would seriously disrupt services and the economic life of the city.
5.      In short, I am sure the Commander-in-Chief is right in thinking that we can not bring the Emergency to an end withoutdetaining a large number of helpers as distinct from managers of Mau Mau;    and action in Nairobi is particularly urgent. But(l)    we should not hit out blindly by detaining all ingiven area.    This has been tried in the past inLeshau Ward after the Meiklejohn murder and itproduced no result.    But a selective measuresbased possibly on(a) information from headmen in Nairobi asto who are helpers of Mau Mau and(b) further information now being compiledas to who in Nairobi are not ingenuine employment is required.(2)    If numbers become very great we will be unable tocontrol what goes on in the camps, and rehabilitation-tion efforts will be swamped because the campswill become breeding grounds of a revived Mar. Maumovement.    I therefore consider that to put100,000 Kikuyu in camps would do more harm than good.    But a phased movement with a top limit, atpresent, of 50,000 on it, is I think inescapable.In Nairobi the men far&apos;exceed in numbers thewomen and children who, I am assured by theProvincial Commissioner of the Central Provincecould return to the reserves.6a      To enable me to take action quickly on the lines suggested in this telegram, I should be glad to know whether you would agree to the broadening of the basis for detentionto cover(a) those who are unemployed and have no place towhich they could safely be sent in the reserves,and who constitute therefore a threat to themaintenance of public order.    This would be particularly directed against Kikuyu loafersand spivs in Nairobi who are known to supportthe Mau Mau or to form most of the City!scriminal element0(b) those suspected of supporting the Mau Mau.    Atpresent as you know,  it has been the policy to confine the GovernorTs Detention Orders tothose against whom there is information fromat least two reliable sources that they aremanagers of Mau Mau, and only total of 1;.00 oddhave been so detained.    I and my advisers feelthis no longer meets the situation and that inorder to demonstrate that the Government mustbe supported, and that overt or covert supportof the Mau Mau will no longer be tolerated, allsuspected or potential trouble-makers should be detained, and previous high and limitingqualifications for a Governor&apos;s Detention Orderbe lowered I understand this has been policy in malaya, combined with rehabilitation measureswhich we are introducing here;    and bothGommander-in-Chief and I consider situation in kenya now requires similar action.
7.      I should also like your agreement to persons sodetained being required to work, by their detention campsbeing designated Special Detention Gamps under Rule 22 ofEmergency (Detained Persons) Regulations 1953 (GovernmentNotice No.h729 of 1953).    This I consider to be essential if the larger number it is now proposed to detain are to berehabilitated in any way.    Experience at existing Athi river and Manda detention camps has shown that without workrehabilitation cannot even begin,8.      Lastly, with the possibility of detaining as many as50?000 men - women and children would be returned to theirrelatives in the reserves - it will be necessary for me to delegate my powers under Emergency Regulation No. 2 ofEmergency Regulations 1952 (Government Notice No.1103 of1952) and I should like your agreement to this also.9o      I understand as regards paragraph 2(e)  (iii) above -Emergency Secretariat - that Secretary of State for War,when here, said he could provide suitable person forimportant post of Head of the Secretariat.    Such an appointment for the next six months or so wou.ld certainly be of great assistance.10o    Oommander-in-Chief has seen this telegram and pointedout that if 2(b)  (ii)  (i0e.  selective removal from Nairobi)is adopted, it will have to be applied on large scale andthere will probably be considerable disruption of normallife of the City.    On the question of numbers to be detained,Oommander-in-Chief has pointed out that we are under obliga-tion to accept 8,000-10,000 from outside Kenya and have afurther 12,000 to move to the settled areas and areas ofother tribes&apos;in Kenya.    It is his belief that we shouldplan for 100,000.11.    I regret putting to you major changes in emergencypolicy at such short notice and having to ask for an earlyreply but I am satisfied that the existing situation requiresrapid changes of policy and new methods.
2(o .TELEGRAM HQ.136 DATED 5TH FEBRUARY,  195UFROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE colonies to THE GOVERNOR OF KENYAYour telegram NoD72.Emergency Policy,,On general policy and organisation I am not yet readyto give you my considered views but in the meantime I amsending this reply to your immediate request,,20     Your paragraph 6I have no objection to your broadening basis fordetention within your present legal powers to the extentyou deem necessary provided that powers are exercisedagainst individuals on grounds (however slender) connectedwith Mau Mau and not against categories of persons.    I alsopresume it is not your intention to deprive any such persons of their right to object to an Advisory Committee.Your paragraph jI agree to this proposal but since we shall be in technical breach of the Forced Labour Convention it wil3be necessary for me to consult my colleagues before givingyou authority.    I consider it important firstly that inthis connection public emphasis should be laid on the rehabilitation character of the camps which should I thinkbe designated &quot;Rehabilitation Camps&quot;, and secondly thatthe greatest care is taken in selecting staff for thesecamps so as to avoid any untoward, incidents which might bring them into the limelight.Your paragraph 8I presume it is your intention to delegate yourpowers to Provincial Commissioners and I should see noobjection to this provided clear instructions were issued on the way in which they are to be exercised.   You will .:no doubt increase the number of your Advisory committees to ensure that objections can be heard without too muchdel ay o3*     I shall be very ready to examine any further measureyou may consider accessary when I visit you as I hope to dotowards the end of this month.
