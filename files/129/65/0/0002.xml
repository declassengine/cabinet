SECRET CrOrO CJPY &quot; Copy No.   67C. (54) 24?/? January, 1954CABINETUSE OF FOREIGN TELEVISION FILMS BY TELEVISION STATIONSMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade and thePostmaster-general there is a distinct danger that unless we take protective measures a largeproportion of the material broadcast on film by commercial television stations heremay be of foreign (mostly American) origin. Popular American television programmes which have covered their enormous production costs in the home market could be offered to the programme companies at prices well below thosecharged for the cheapest British product. The B.B.C consider it their responsibility to give their programmes a strong British flavour, but commercial stations mightwant to use American material on a fairly large scale since much of it is likely tobe of good quality, cheap and popular; and there is accordingly a danger that commercial television here might become &quot; Americanised.&quot; A number of interested bodies (notably the Cinematograph Films Council; the associationrepresenting producers of short films; and trade unions of actors, musicians andauthors) have expressed their anxiety on this subject, and are clearly afraid of thedanger that the entertainments industry in this country will be hard hit as televisiongrows.2. We feel sure our colleagues will agree that television programmes hereshould derive their inspiration and material mainly from British sources, whiiekeeping a proper place for foreign programmes and performers of outstandingmerit.3. Accordingly, we have studied various possible methods of achieving thisend and have concluded that the best course would be to use some kind of quota system broadly comparable with the arrangements for cinematograph films. this could be done consistently with our obligations under the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade. The responsible Minister could make regulations (if possible,under the Act setting up the competitive television system) which would limit theuse of foreign films by the programme companies (and by the B.B.C.) according tothe quantity of British films shown. The quotas themselves would of course bevariable from time to time.4. Although such a scheme could be imposed through the new Corporation^contractual arrangements, statutory backing seems to us desirable to avoid undueinfluence on the Corporation, to relieve it of the associated administrative burden,and to provide for sanctions other than those available to the Corporation fordealing with programme companies failing to attain the required quotas.5. The fixing of the appropriate percentage quota of British films to be shown depends on several factors, namely, (i) the maximum amount of foreign filmswhich can be allowed without affecting the British character of the programmes;(ii) the amount of British television films which are likely to be produced; and(iii) the availability of British films other than those made specially for televisionshowing.  At the moment it looks as though the daily programme on commercial45438Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1954
television will last for about live hours or more. We cannot yet say with any certainty how much of that time will be taken up by showing films. We consider,however, that the percentage quota should be determined on a-sliding scale related to the time devoted to foreign and British films in total; and should be so arranged that, with a daily programme of not less than five hours, the maximum time duringwhich foreign films could be shown would be half an hour per day on average.6. The system described above would not compel programme companies toshow any films at all, though it will give some incentive to the film industry by providing that foreign films could only be shown if a specified,minimum amountof British films was also shown. Some of the performers&apos; unions would like a limitset to the use of films, but we think the division between films and &quot; live &quot; material(that is performances or events televised direct to viewers) is a matter best left to negotiation between those concerned without intervention by the Government.7. We do not suggest any quota restriction for &quot; live &quot; programmes because there is not the same risk of an excessive use of foreign performers and there arealready arrangements for regulating the entry of foreign performers into thiscountry.8.   We therefore seek the approval of our colleagues for:(i) the principle that British television programmes should draw their materialmainly from British sources;(ii) the scheme of regulation designed to safeguard that principle and described in paragraphs 3 and 5 above;,   ,  (iii) a public announcement about the Governmenfs intention in this respect,including an indication that the Government had in mind a quota whichwould permit foreign films for a maximum of half an hour a day on average.P.
