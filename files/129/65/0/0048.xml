Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1954SECRETCopy No.    6C. (54) 488th February, 1954CABINET office record COPYCABINETTHE ROYAL TOUR OF CEYLONNote by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I circulate for the consideration of theCabinet&apos; the attached text of a telegram from the Queen&apos;s Private Secretary to thePrivate Secretary to the Prime Minister.(Signed)        NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,Soulbury has now written firmly supporting Kotelawala&apos;s advice that The Queenshould visit Tooth and enclosing copy of Kotelawala&apos;s letter to Sir winston churchill.2.   Naturally The Queen will defer any decision till we hear from you.3. Her Majesty had hoped that this controversial matter would not be raisedby Ceylon and I had written more than once to Soulbury urging that it should be avoided if possible.4. It has not been possible and Ceylon Government evidently attach im-portance to the visit. I should tell you that in view of her own constitutional position as Queen of Ceylon and also in view of serious possibilities likely tofollow rejection of advice, Her Majesty would be inclined to accept it.5. The Queen has no personal views against visiting Temple, which has beendone by other members of her family, providing no religious service or offeringis involved.   She had undertaken to do this as Princess Elizabeth in 1952.6. She hopes that, if Cabinet favours her accepting Kotelawala&apos;s advice and she then accepts it, Sir Winston Churchill may be prepared, if necessary, to explainher constitutional position vis-a-vis Ceylon and reasons for her action to Churchauthorities and particularly to Archbishop of Canterbury.8th February, 1954.5th February, 1954.45659
