Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1954CONFIDENTIALCABINET office record copy copy No.C. (54) 395th February, 1954CABINETTHE ROYAL TOUR OF CEYLONNote by the Prime minister circulate to the Cabinet the text of a letter which I have received from thePrime Minister of Ceylon suggesting that The Queen should visit the Temple ofthe Tooth at Kandy. When this question arose in 1952, I wrote to the then PrimeMinister of Ceylon, Mr. Senanayake, explaining that it was likely to be misunder-stood by Her Majesty&apos;s Christian subjects if The Queen were to remove hershoes before entering the Shrine and to present an offering of gold to the Idolas is traditionally done by distinguished visitors to the Temple. Mr. Senanayakereplied that, in the circumstances, he thought it best that The Queen should notvisit the Temple during her visit to Ceylon. In the new circumstances envisaged bySir John Kotelawala, there would be no question of a presentation of gold to theIdol, or of any religious ceremony.Would you please refer to your letter of the 29th December, .1952, to my predecessor in office (Mr. Dudley Senanayake) regarding the Queen&apos;s visit to theTemple of the Tooth at Kandy. In this letter you had appreciated our anxietythat Her Majesty should visit the temple and suggested that this would be possible if it could be arranged for Her to do so without removing Her shoes or makingW. S. C.10, Downing Street, S.W.1,5 th February, 1954.My dear Prime Minister,Colombo, 28th January, 1954.45652
a direct offering. Mr. Dudley Senanayake in his reply to you at that time had stated that taking everything into consideration, the most satisfactory solution would be to omit this visit from the programme altogether. Both your letter andMr. Dudley Senanayake&apos;s letter had been dealt with as private letters and hadnot come to my notice or to the notice of His Excellency the Governor-Generaluntil this programme was drawn up and the question of viewing the Royal Pereherafrom the Octagon of the Temple of the Tooth was considered. Had your lettercome to our notice earlier, I would most certainly have taken this matter up with you much earlier and I am certain that the Governor-General would himself have discussed this matter with the Palace authorities when he was in London to confer with the Palace officials regarding the. details of Her Majesty&apos;s programme in ceylon. Conditions have changed considerably since Mr. Dudley Senanayakewrote to you about this matter. Indeed the anxiety of the people for a welcome to Her Majesty has been so great that we have had to turn down a large number of requests for various items on Her programme. But we find it is impossible to turndown the request that Her Majesty should visit the Temple and view the SacredTooth and the Jewellery endowed to the Temple by ancient Kings and Queensof Ceylon.From time immemorial the capital of Ceylon had been located in the place where the sacred Tooth was kept. When the Kandyan Kingdom was ceded to theBritish in 1815 by the Kandyan Convention there was a special clause in theConvention which provided for the protection of the Buddhist Faith. Her Majesty&apos;sancestors and Her uncles had all visited the Temple of the Tooth and had viewed the Tooth Relic and Jewellery. Reigning Kings of various countries have alwaysviewed the Tooth Relic when they visited Ceylon and there is now a persistentdemand from a very large section of the people of the country that Her majesty should do likewise. Indeed, they say that quite apart from any other consideration,Her Majesty should visit the Temple as Queen of Ceylon and Head of theCommonwealth and not give cause for offence to a large number of Her Buddhistand Hindu subjects, who constitute over 85 per cent, of the population of thecountry.I annex a letter addressed to me by the Custodians of the Temple and those responsible for the Royal Perehera. These gentlemen have invited Her majesty the Queen to visit the Temple of the Tooth and attend a special exposition of theTooth Relic when she visits the Octagon to view the Royal Perehera at Kandy.There will be no religious ceremony connected with Her visit to the Temple as theMaha Nayakas (Chief Priests) and Temple Chiefs have given this assurance and are particularly anxious to prevent any kind of misunderstanding among Her Christiansubjects or cause any embarrassment to Her Majesty. Her Majesty will only haveto remove her shoes on entering the Relic Chamber and our Officials who have discussed this with the Palace officials were told that she would be quite preparedto do so if it was the custom.I feel most strongly both as Prime Minister and in my personal capacity thatHer Majesty should accept this invitation and I trust that you will be good enoughto transmit this letter to Her Majesty and support my recommendation that she should accept the invitation.  It would be very unfortunate if the Queen of Ceylon
V3and Head of the Commonwealth were to decline this invitation and wound the religious susceptibilities of a large section of Her loyal Subjects. If this were to happen, it would create religious dissension between the large Buddhist population and the comparatively small Christian population in Ceylon.Right Hon&apos;ble Sir Winston Churchill, P.C., M.P.,Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,10 Downing Street,London, S.W. 1.The Hon. the Prime Minister,Senate Building, Sri Dalada Maligawa,We wish to emphasise the fact&apos; that the right to invite Her Majesty The Queento view the Sacred Tooth Relic is vested in the two Maha Nayakas of Malwatte andAsgiriya, the Diyawadana Nilame and the Basnayake Nilames of the four Devalesin Kandy. I, as representative of the Maha Nayakas and the four Temple Chiefs,extend to Her Majesty in humble duty the invitation to view the Tooth Relic andthe jewellery before she goes to the Octagon to give the Temple Chiefs the mandateto start the Perahera. We give the assurance that Her Majesty will not be invitedto participate in any religious ceremony, and we assume responsibility for this invitation.We understand that a memorandum has already been presented to His Excel-lency the Governor-General urging the reasons for our request that Her majesty should view the Sacred Tooth Relic in keeping with past traditions.Yours sincerely,J. KOTELAWALA.Colombo.Kandy,27th January, 1945.Dear Sir,Signed.Diyawadana Nilame.Basnayake Nilame, Maha Devale.Basnayake Nilame, Kataragama Devale.Basnayake Nilame, Pattini Devale.
