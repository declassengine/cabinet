MIDDLE EAST DE FENCEMemorandum by the Chiefs of StaffWe have been invited to comment on the military aspects ofthe proposals contained in the memorandum on Middle East policy,(C. (54) 6) , by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,Importance of securing agreement with the Egyptians2. We are convinced that, wherever we re-deploy our Middle Eastforces, a base in the Canal Zone - with double entry from theMediterranean and Red Sea - will be not only of great value, but indeedessential for the support of our own and Allied forces in the Middle Eastin war.    We could only maintain our forces there through an alternativebase or bases in the Eastern Mediterranean so long as Turkey and theStraits were held0    If the first phase of the war should go badly for us,our sea communications through the Mediterranean may well become soprecarious as to be useless for this purpose.    Such bases would not therefore be a satisfactory alternative to the base in the Canal Zone.3. Our ability to develop the defences of the Middle East in peace,to ensure its defence in war, and to maintain our air communicationswill depend on our being able to get facilities and co-operation in Iraq,Libya and Jordan,    We believe that failure to secure an agreement with egypt will seriously affect our relations with these countries, and, inparticular, will prejudice our ability to obtain Iraqi agreement to the useof their airfields and to pre-stocking equipment and ammunition in thatcountry.Military implications of failure to secure agreementRe - de ployment4. We intend, in any case, to reduce the Middle East garrison toone armoured division and 8 R.A.F. squadrons and to re-deploy them asshown in the Appendix.    If the Canal Zone base is not available, we shall need to pre-stock elsewhere war equipment and sufficient war reserves to enable our forces to fight in the opening phase of war.    We shall needalso to develop a port in the Eastern Mediterranean, and a smalladvanced base.5. We agree with the Foreign Secretary that we cannot base ourMiddle East defence policy mainly on co-operation with Israel.    We might,however, obtain from Israel facilities for oil storage and the repair of heavy equipment.-1-The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No.c.(54) 9 CABINET OFFICE9TH JANUARY, 1954
IT)6. The Foreign Secretary has suggested that we might follow up theTurkish suggestion for pre-stocking equipment at Mar din and the&quot;outer ring&quot; strategy.    We would emphasise that the &quot;outer ring&quot; strategyis only practicable if we succeed in developing the Iraqi forces, are ableto deploy and maintain our own forces in support of them, and are assured of a sufficiency of air forces.    Present resources are not sufficient forthis strategy.    We agree, however, that the Turkish suggestion should befurther examined as a partial solution of our problems in case we shouldbe denied the use of the Canal and the Canal Zone Base.    We should require port facilities at Alexandretta and a line of communicationforward to Mardin.Naval Implications7. The loss of the combined facilities of Alexandria, Port Said andSuez would, in war, seriously limit naval operations in the eastern mediterranean.Air Communications8. The loss of military air transit facilities in Egypt would seriously affect our air communications with East Africa and the Far East.If, in addition, the other Arab States denied us staging and overflyingrights, these communications would be completely disrupted.    Egypt isat present agreeable to granting these rights, but if they were to be with-drawn owing to failure to reach an agreement there is a grave risk thatthe other Middle East States would follow suit.Military Aspects of alternative courses proposed by the Foreign SecretaryCourse (a); To stay on indefinitely in the Cg.na.1 Zone9. If this course was adopted, we could expect Egyptian oppositionto become increasingly more violent.    We should probably have to sendreinforcements to the Canal Zone;  and, unless British civilians wereevacuated from the Delta, we might ultimately be forced to carry outOperation Rodeo.Course (b); To withdraw in our own time, completing theoperation by December 1956Course (c); To begin to wind up the Base, whilst submittingthe continuation of the 1936 Treaty to arbitration10, If we have to wind up the Base, it is important to get Egyptianco-operation.    If we have to face Egyptian non-co-operation and increasedterrorist activity, we can do little more than re-deploy the combatanttroops and their unit equipment; we might have to abandon the bulk of the stores.    We believe that withdrawal in these conditions would beregarded as a victory for Egypt and would prejudice our chances ofobtaining satisfactory agreements with the other Arab states.    WithEgyptian co-operation, our withdrawal could be carried out smoothly andmore economically.    If we failed to obtain an agreement and are forced towind up the Dace, whichever course would be more likely to secureEgyptian co-operation would seem to be preferable fror,-. the military point of view.
23Conclusion11. We believe that failure to secure an agreement with Egypt wouldhave the most serious effects on our whole strategic position in theMiddle East and would in particular prejudice our ability to obtain thefacilities we require in the Arab countries which are essential to ourre-deployment and defence plans.12. Geographically there is no site in the Middle East suitable asan alternative to the Canal Zone for the establishment of a main base tosupport our own and Allied forces in war.    We have always realised thatan agreement with the Egyptians on the terms now proposed would have serious military disadvantages.    But we consider it so important fromthe general strategic point of view to reach an agreement that we areprepared to accept these disadvantages.    If it would tip the scales infavour of an agreement, we would be prepared even to go further on thequestion of uniform; and, in the last resort, to accept that our troops should wear a special uniform, provided that it was clearly Her Majestylsuniform, and that officers, Warrant Officers and N.C.O.ss carriedbadges of rank and that all were allowed to carry personal weapons.(Signed) R.
