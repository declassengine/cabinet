1STSECRETCABINET office record COPY COPY NO*Al-30TH JANUARY, 1954.CABINETRELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET union note by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues the annexedrecord of a conversation in Berlin between the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Foreign Office (Mr. Nutting) and the Soviet Ambassador to theUnited Kingdom.A.E.29TH JANUARY, 1954ANNEXWhen Mr. Malik came to see me yesterday the main theme of his conversation was German re-armament and European security.2. He began by saying that he welcomed those passages in Mr, Eden&apos;sspeech which looked forward to creating greater confidence between thepowers.    If we could agree about German unity that would be a big step forward.    But how could we do this so long as the West continued to insist that Germany should join the N.A.T.O. camp?    I pointed out that what wewere insisting upon was the right of the German people, through freelyelected representatives, to make a free choice in these matters.    Surelythis was the sensible course and one which took account of past mistakes.Mr, Malik made it clear that we could not put our trust in the fx*ee choice ofGermany.    German democracy sounded very good, but what had hajjpened toStresemann and Company?    West Germany was riddled with Nazis, neo-Nazis, Revenchists and Hitler&apos;s ex-Generals.    With such people in positions of influence as they were to-day in Germany there could be no free choicefor Germany, and only a continued threat to peace.    These were the peoplew .o were backing E.D.C0? for they saw in this device the opportunity to embark upon ultimately unlimited German re-armament and a crusade to recover by force the Oder-Neisse territories.     Mra Malik brushed asideall arguments about the restraints and safeguards provided by E0D0C,,, sayingthat the French could not possibly restrain a revival of German militarism.3. I then asked Mr. Malik how he reconciled with all this theproposal in one of the earlier Soviet Notes in 1952 that a re-united germany should have a national army.    How did he propose that this national army should be controlled?    There would be none of the guarantees against itsunlimited expansion which E0D.C, contained.    He replied that such restrictions as were desirable should be laid down and that Great Britain,
France and the Soviet Union should band together to see that they were adhered to.    He declined my invitation to develop precisely how this would work;  andwhen I suggested that this would be merely repeating the mistakes of the pasthe made no reply.4, I also asked Mr. Malik why he had left out the United States.Mr0 Molotov had spent much time in saying that we must go back to Potsdam.But the Americans were signatories of the Potsdam Agreement.    What had become of them in his calculations?    Mr, Malik made no direct answer^,but instead launched into a lengthy attack upon American designs.    The   .United States&apos; purpose was clearly to perpetuate, even to widen, the gulfbetween East and West, and in particular the division of Germany,    TheUnited States did not want to unite Europe,    On the contrary their policy was to profit politically and in every way from its continued division,    Imerely remarked rather bluntly that it was futile to try and divide Britainand Europe from the United States.    These imptatations were quite falseand I invited Mr. Malik to await what Mr. Dulles would have to say at theConference.5. I summed up this part of our talk by saying that the united Westernpurpose was to help and encourage Germany to devote her immense energiesand resources to peace and not to war, and to bring the German people, bytheir own free choice and consent, into a peaceful European community.There seemed to me no other safe or sensible policy.    Mr. Malik agreed with this purpose but said E.D.C,, backed as it was by America and  J.A.T.Q0 ,would produce the very opposite result.    1 said that in that case there seemedto be no hope of our agreement.     For, quite apart from what the western powers thought, the 50 million Germans in the Federal Republic would never agree to re-unification on the terms provided by the Soviet Government,If that was the case, Germany would remain divided.    At this Mr. Malikshrugged his shoulders and said that perhaps this was inevitable.     FromRussia&apos;s point of view such a division, even if it meant West Germany inE.D,C., was preferable to a re-united Germany in the Atlantic bloc.6. I then asked Mr. Malik what he thought of our plan for free elections in Germany.    As Mr, Eden had made clear, this was the first essential step towards a re-united Germany.    Mr. Malik said that electionsconducted under the auspices of the four occupying powers could not possibly be free.    This was a matter which the Germans, East and West, should arrange between themselves.    I remarked that in the &quot;Western Zones twoperfectly free parliamentary elections had been held, although the occupationcontinued.    Mr. Malik denied that these elections were free, since53 per cent of the Bonn Parliament were ex-Nazis or neo-Nazis, but hedeclined to name any.    When I remarked that Naumann, whom we suspected of seeking a Nazi revival, had not gained one single seat for his party,Mro Malik said the Naumann group were of no significance.    The realNazis were masquerading under democratic labfels.    I could not resist adig about elections in the Eastern Zone.    If elections under occupationconditions could not be considered free, how would Mr, Malik describe theresults of the East Zone elections?    I got no answer.     Finally, we turned to China,7, Mr. Malik dwelt on the importance of a Five-Power Conferenceand of recognising and admitting Communist China to the United Nations,If we recognised her, why did we not admit her right to represent China in the United Nations ?    I gave him the obvious answer.    He replied,
rather weakly, that China felt herself threatened by MacArthur&apos;s march to the Yalu.    I said that this was no excuse for China&apos;s interference.When Germany had swallowed up countries bordering on Russia in the late war, the Soviet Union had still remained neutral,,    Mr, Malik made no reply.    Nor did he answer me when I asked why Communist China had notrecognised us.    All I got was talk about the trade embargo dictated and forced upon us by the United States.(Signed)    H.A, NUTTINGBerlin,27TH JANUARY, 1954,
