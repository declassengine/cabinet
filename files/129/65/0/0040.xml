Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1954CONFIDENTIALCABINET office record copy copy No.    g gC. (54) 406th February, 1954CABINETBRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION: INCREASE IN charges memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation in C. (54) 1 I reported that the British Transport Commission had applied for my authority to increase existing railway freight charges by 10 per cent, (subjectto a limit of 10s. a ton), and that I had referred the application to the transport tribunal, acting as a Consultative Committee, for their advice.2. I have now received their advice, which is to authorise these increases. I attach a summary (Annex II).3. I am sure that the only course is to accept this advice and approve theincrease in charges.4. I cannot, however,, disguise the fact that I am disturbed about the financial prospects of the Commission.5. It seems that without some radical new approach, only regular increases in fares and charges can keep them solvent. I understand that they will be applying to the Transport Tribunal within a week or so for a further increase in london passenger fares.6. It is arguable, however, that the Commission^ charges are near theirpractical limit, and as these increases are not only politically difficult but might prove economically impracticable, I think that it will be necessary to do something to help them.7. I fully share the Chancellor^ view that the Commission must not look tothe Government for help in meeting their normal operating costs, including wages.But they cannot be made competitive without large-scale modernisation of theirrailway equipment. I think the financing of this is quite another matter. It will be beyond their strength to provide for this and bear the full interest charges involvedbefore such new investments become remunerative.8. The Chairman of the Commission, Sir Brian Robertson, is now developingplans for modernising the railways. When they have progressed further, I shallbring them before my colleagues with proposals as to how they can be financed.9. Meanwhile, I see no alternative but to go ahead with the proposed freightincreases.10.   I seek authority(a) to announce in the House that I will authorise these increases, andi   (b) to publish the Tribunal Committee&apos;s advice in the Official Report.11.   All these considerations are set out more fully in Annex I.A. L.-B.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1,5th February, 1954.45653
1 British Transport Commission : Increase in ChargesFuller Statement of Considerations1. The Transport Tribunal acting as a Consultative Committee have advisedme to authorise the increase of 10 per cent, in railway freight, dock aria! canal charges for which the British Transport Commission have asked.        &apos;      ,   ,2. The Committee (and it rests with them to decide this) did riot hold a public inquiry or consult with traders. I have, however, received a certain number of representations. Various Scottish bodies have represented that any further increasein freight rates will be disastrous to Scottish interests, including fishing. They havealso urged a scaling down of railway freight rates over long distances and the special treatment of commodities in which Scotland is particularly interested. In england the Traders&apos; Co-ordinating Committee on Transport and the Association of BritishChambers of Commerce have made representations. The former suggest that theincrease should be limited to not more than 5 per cent, and that the facts shouldbe fully disclosed and discussed with trade and industry before action is taken. Thelatter raise much wider issues. The Association emphasise the inflationary effect which a further increase in freight charges may have, particularly through the effecton the prices of coal and steel. They concede that there should be an increase tocover the December, 1953 wage award, but suggest that any further increase in wages should be met by increased efficiency and that there should be no increasein charges to cover other increases in costs pending an inquiry into the structure,organisation, and operation of British railways. This should be carried out by a working Party on which the Commission, users of transport, and organised labour would be represented, with an impartial Chairman. Among the questions whichshould be considered are possible under-utilisation of railway carrying capacity,probable existence of surplus carrying capacity, possibilities of achieving economies,and the whole question of the capitalisation of British Railways.3. I am sure that the only course is to accept the Committee&apos;s recommenda-tion and approve the proposed increase in charges.4. I cannot, however, disguise the fact that I am disturbed about the financial prospects of the Commission. We can have faith that the Commission will getdown very soon not only to the re-organisation of the structure of the railwaysrequired by the Transport Act, 1953, but also to the more difficult problem of cuttingout unremunerative services, improving and extending remunerative services and generally bringing the whole organisation up to date. Nobody is more alive thanSir Brian Robertson to the need for improving the efficiency of their organisationand we must give them the chance to do it. Any resultant economies are, however,already heavily mortgaged to meet further increases in wages.5. It seems, therefore, that without some radical new approach, only theseregular increases in fares and charges can keep the Commission solvent. I have infact just been told by Sir Brian Robertson that the Commission will be applying,within the next week or so, direct to the Transport Tribunal for a further increasein London Passenger Fares.6. It is arguable, however, that the Commission^ charges are near theirpractical limit. The Commission have already indicated that many of theirpassenger charges are so high that they cannot be further increased without drivingthe traffic to road and air or bringing into operation the law of diminishing returns.London passenger charges are not, in the Commission^ view, enabling london transport to meet their proper allocation of central charges but an increase,producing an additional  2-3 million would do this unless it is swallowed by furtherwage increases. Railway freight rates are now nearly 2  times pre-war, and withthe proposed increase would be over 2\ times pre-war. The rates for high-classmerchandise may well be as high as is possible in the face of steadily increasingroad competition. In the case of coal and basic materials, a further increase in charges might produce more revenue but the effect on the national economy cannotbe disregarded. It seems therefore that in spite of economies and improvedefficiency, the stage may be approaching when.the Commission cannot pay their way and their charges cannot usefully be further increased.
7. Taking the long view therefore, and bearing in mind that these regularincreases in fares and charges are not only politically difficult, but may prove to be economically.impracticable, I think that it will be necessary to do something to help them. I do hot believe that British Railways, whose finances dominate those of theCommission, can be made competitive without large-scale modernisation of their equipment. It will be beyond their own resources to provide for this and to bear the full interest, charges involved in the initial period before such new investmentsbecome remunerative. .v,.&apos; -.       - y:8.

The Commission consider that their estimates are optimistic and provisional and there may well be a further application for increased charges.2. The estimates for a future year show a deficit of  25-2 million comparedwith a surplus of  4-5 million in 1952.3. The worsening in the net receipts of British Railways is estimated at 22 million. It is estimated that passenger traffic will be less and freight traffic willbe more than in 1952, but in both cases, owing to increased charges, gross receiptswill be higher. The main items of increase in working expenses are wages  16-million, price levels  6 - 3 million and maintenance  16 million.4. The Committee deal with the various increases in working expenses, and give a full explanation of the increased charge for maintenance. The Commission^practice was to charge to revenue a standard charge for maintenance based on pre-war expenditure properly adjusted and to charge the balance of maintenance expenditure to the Abnormal Maintenance Account. This Account stood at about 150 million on 1st January, 1948, and will probably be less than  50 million at theend of 1953. The Commission have already started, and now propose to complete,the change to a practice of charging to revenue the actual maintenance expenditurein each year. It is estimated that the effect of this will be to add  21 million to themaintenance costs charged against revenue as compared with 1952. The Commis-sion have included only  16 million additional in the estimates for the future yearand will, if necessary, charge the remaining  5 million against the AbnormalMaintenance Account. The Committee think that this temporary relief of 5 million is as much as would be justifiable.5. The Committee discussed the allocation of central charges. They con-clude that the amount of  39 - 5 million allocated by the Commission to the rail-ways is not excessive and that the net railway receipts in a future year will be 23 million less than that amount.6. The Committee agree with the Commission that no appreciable contri-bution to the immediate necessities of British Railways can be expected frompassenger traffic.7. The additional revenue from the proposed increase in rail freight chargesis estimated at  23 million. This estimate is speculative, but it would be unwise toact upon the view that the Commission have under-estimated the yield.8. The 10 per cent, increase in dock and canal charges would produce a ne trevenue slightly, but not unduly,, higher than would be required to meet a properallocation of central charges. . i ; . ;   :        v9.
