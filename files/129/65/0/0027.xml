THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL AND PUBLIC PROSECUTIONSMemorandum by the Lord chancellor in Cabinet on 21st January the report by the Secretary of State forWar upon events in Kenya led unexpectedly to a discussion on the independence of the Attorney-General from the Government in deciding whether or not to institute criminal proceedings.    I intervened in this discussion without duepreparation or forethought and may have misled my colleagues.    I think it right therefore to circulate a considered opinion to correct any wrongimpression that I may have given.2.        The doctrine of the independence of the Attorney-General in deciding whether or not to institute a prosecution is a modern development, and I donot suppose that in the 17th or 18th centuries the Government would havehesitated to give directions to the Attorney-General in such matters.    Inrecent years the question has come before the House of Commons on threeimportant occasions:  on 8th October, 1924 in the debate on the Campbellcase, on 1st December, 1925 in the debate on the prosecution of certainCommunists, and on 29th January, 1951 when, in answer to a question byMr. Ungoed Thomas, the Attorney-General, Sir Hartley Shawcross, madea statement about the function of the Attorney-General in regard toprosecutions.3.        The views and practice disclosed on these occasions showed acertain degree of divergence.    Thus, in the debate on the Campbell casethe Attorney-General, Sir Patrick Hastings, quoted from a letter written on 31st January, 1919 by Sir Gordon Hewart, then Attorney-General, to theDirector of Public Prosecutions, which read as follows (Official Report,col. 598):-&quot;My dear Director,There can be no doubt, I think, that this speech isseditious and that a prosecution may properly follow,but it appears to me that the real question is one ofpolicy and therefore is a question in the first instancefor the Home Secretary and the Minister of Labour. &quot;That letter was sent by the Home Secretary to the Cabinet, and the Directorof Public Prosecutions in due course received a communication from theCabinet as follows:-&quot;I am directed by the Minister of Labour, withregard to your letter of 1st February that was sent bySir Gordon Hewart to the Cabinet regarding the prosecution oi X, to say that this matter was consideredyesterday by the Cabinet and that the Minister under-stands that you will receive instructions from theSecretary of State for the Home Department. &quot;OFFICE        copy no. (ijRECORD COPYCABINETSECRETC.(54) 2726TH JANUARY, 1954
On the other hand, Sir Patrick also quoted from a letter which Lord Birkenheadhad written to the Press in relation to the Campbell case, in which lord Birkenhead said (Official Report, col. 614):-&quot;When I was the Attorney-General, the then WarCabinet, of which I was not a member, directed me to prosecute a certain person for sedition and entered thisdirection upon the minutes of the Cabinet.    The Directorof Public Prosecutions brought this minute to me and asked for my directions.    I told him that I would not even consider the question of instituting a prosecutionupon its merits until the unconstitutional minute hadbeen excised.    Nor did I do so. &quot;Again in the same debate, the Prime Minister,Mr,RamseyMacdonald,stated (Official Report, col. 629):-&quot;Curaly every Law Officer who is undertaking a prosecution in the interests of the State must possesshimself not only of guidance on technical law but mustpossess himself of guidance on this question, whether,if a prosecution is instituted, the effect of the prosecu-tion will be harmful or beneficial to the State, in whoseinterests it has been undertaken. &quot;In answer to this, Sir Douglas Hogg stated (Official Report, col. 686):-&quot; I am not quite sure that I should entirely acceptthe position as set out by the Prime Minister.    When Iwas Attorney-General, at any rate, when once a prosecu-tion was instituted I never took advice or counsel orbrooked interference from any Minister or anybody elseon the question whether it should be withdrawn.     That wasa matter which rightly or wrongly I regarded as my duty and a duty which I ought to exercise judicially anduninfluenced by any outside person. &quot;4.        In the debate of 1st December, 1925 on the Communist prosecutions,Sir John Simon made an important statement (Official Report, col. 2105):-&quot; I understand the duty of the Attorney-General tobe this.    He should absolutely decline to receive orders from the Prime Minister, or Cabinet or anybody elsethat he shall prosecute.    His first duty is to see thatno one is prosecuted with all the majesty of the lawunless the Attorney-General, as head of the Bar, is satisfied that a case for prosecution lies against him.I-Ie should receive orders from nobody.    But that isvery different from saying that the Attorney-Generalought in all cases to ask nobody else&apos;s view, because he thinks there is a case to institute a prosecutionwithout finding out what his colleagues or the Govern-ment think.    That is a ridiculous proposition.    If the leader of the Opposition at the General Election wereto make a seditious speech, does anyone mean to tellme a Conservative Attorney-General would start a prosecution against him without consulting the Cabinet?Of course he would not; and, indeed, the other view2
Coohas been proclaimed by the present Prime Minister/&quot;Mr. Baldwin/ himself.    I have before me his state-ment, which he made on 18th December last year, whenhe said, in aswer to the Leader of the Opposition/&quot;Mr. Ramsay Macdonald/ that -*When the proposed prosecution is ofsuch a character that matters of public policy are, or may be, involved, it is the duty of the attorney-General to inform himself of theviews of the Government or of the appropriate minister before coming to a decision. 1 /&quot;official report, 18th December, 1924:  col. 1214, vol. 179.J7Of course it is, and I lose patience when I am told thatthe prosecution of Communists is, as a matter of fact,a thing that the Cabinet, whether a Labour Cabinet orthe colleagues of the Attorney-General, know nothingabout.    I am confident that the Attorney-General would never undertake a prosecution, whatever anybody asked him to do, unless he thought the prosecution was justified,but I should regard him not as a good Attorney-Generalbut as a fool if he were to start on his own motionprosecutions which involve grave matters of public concern - treason, sedition, corruption, a.nd the like -I should regard it as a very grave mistake if he did -such a thing without knowing that, in the view of hiscolleagues, public policy was not offended by undertakingsuch prosecution. &quot;5. The statement on the duties of the Attorney-General in regard toprosecution made by Sir Hartley Shawcross on 29th January, 1951 includedthese remarks (Official Report, col. 685):-H. I have to remember that the doctrine is that itis the duty of an Attorney-General, in deciding whetheror not to authorise the prosecution, to acquaint himself with all the relevant facts, including, for instance, theeffect which the prosecution, successful or unsuccessfulas the case may be,   would have upon public morale andorder, and with any other considerations affecting public policy.&quot; In order so to inform himself, he may, although I do not think he is obliged to, consult with any of hiscolleagues in the Government; and indeed, as lord Simon once said, he would in some cases be afool if he did not.    On the other hand, the assistanceof his colleagues is confined to informing him ofparticular considerations which might affect his owndecision, and does not consist, and must not consist,in telling him what that decision ought to be.    Theresponsibility for the eventual decision rests with the attorney-General, and he is not to be put, and is not put, under pressure by his colleagues in the matter.11 Nor, of course, can the Attorney-General shifthis responsibility for making the decision on to theshoulders of his colleagues.    If considerations in the-3-
m \broad sense that I have indicated affect government inthe abstract, it is the Attorney-General, applying hisjudicial mind, who has to be the sole judge of thoseconsiderations.&quot; That was the view that Lord Birkenhead onceexpressed on a famous occasion, and Lord Simonstated that the Attorney-General -should absolutely decline toreceive orders from the Prime Minister,or Cabinet or anybody else that he shallprosecute. 1I would add to that that he should also decline toreceive orders that he should not prosecute.    Thatis the traditional   and undoubted position of the attorney-General in such matters. &quot;6.        The effect of these statements, which have great weight and authority, is in my opinion as follows.    There is no doubt that the ultimate responsibility of deciding whether to prosecute or not is the Attorney-General^.    In reaching his decision he has to exercise a discretion, andit is not usual for the Cabinet to attempt to influence him in the exerciseof that discretion.    The origins of this doctrine, which is of recent develop-ment, are obscure, but it may have arisen partly because, like theexercise of the Royal Prerogative of mercy or the making of a Budget, whichare also matters in which the Cabinet does not intervene, the decisionrequires a knowledge of such a complex set of facts that it is unsuitable fordiscussion in Cabinet and only one man can make the decision.    But it isprobably due to a larger extent to the notion that the administration ofjustice must be kept free from political bias, and that a decision whether to prosecute or not is, or ought to be, in the nature of a judicial decision which should not be subject to interference by the Executive.    Nevertheless,there are certain classes of case, e. g. sedition, riot, unlawful assembly,etc. , in which considerations of public policy and safety must of necessityarise that make it at least advisable for the Attorney-General to consultindividual Ministers or the Cabinet on those aspects of the case.    If he does not do so it would be right for the Cabinet or those of his colleaguesmost closely interested, e. g. the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary, toinform him what their views are on the question of public policy.    But thedecision remains his decision, and whatever advice the Cabinet or individual ministers give him, they certainly cannot direct him what he is to do.    AnAttorney-General who disregarded advice properly tendered to him by hiscolleagues on an issue of public policy might be regarded as foolish, andno doubt the possibility of dismissal from office would be present to his mind.    But that consideration does not affect the principle that it is for the attorney-General alone to make his decision,7.        It is clear, therefore, that it is only where a question of public policy arises that Ministers may express their views to the Attorney-General and then on that question alone.    The Attorney-General mustrefuse to listen to any arguments based on political expediency.    This wasthe criticism directed by Sir Douglas Hogg against the action ofSir Patrick Hastings in the Campbell case: that the prosecution had been withdrawn under pressure by his colleagues, not so much for reasons ofpublic policy, as for reasons of Party politics (Official Report, col. 686).The line between politics and public policy is hard to drawj and there is always a danger that a Government which is known to have intervened byadvice or direction to the Attorney-General will be accused by its critics
lot-of using the plea of national interest as a cloak for political expediency.It is therefore a matter of prudence for any Government to be extremelycautious in intervention.    It is notable that the firmest expression of the doctrine in recent times was made by Sir Hartley Shawcross (with theapproval of both sides of the House) at a time when there had been a numberof prosecutions arising out of illegal strikes, and when it might be expectedthat the Attorney-General in a Socialist Government would be under severepressure from his own Party,8,        I should perhaps add that there is in my opinion no reason why theCabinet should not discuss the propriety of a prosecution or of advice being offered to the Attorney-General, but to do so in his presence would generally be undesirable.SIMONDSLord Chancellor&apos;s Department,House of Lords, S.
