(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJSSTY&apos;G government)secret,(54)372ND FEBRUARY, 1954CABINET office record copy copy NOCABINETRECRUITMENT OF COLOURED persons to THE CIVIL service memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in C. (54) 34 the Home Secretary reports on the examinationof the possibilities of preventing any further increase in the number of coloured people seeking employment in this country, which the cabinet invited him to arrange on 18th November, 1952 (C.C(52) 106th Conclusions,Minute 7).    At the same time the Cabinet invited me to arrange for theconcurrent examination of the possibility of restricting the number of coloured people obtaining admission to the Civil Service.    I now reporton this.The present positionNumbers2e Civil Service staff records do not distinguish between coloured people and white people.    Precise figures of the number of coloured peopleemployed at present could therefore be obtained only by detailed enquiry.This has been thought to be undesirable.    It is certain, however, that thenumber of coloured people employed whether as permanent or as temporary staff is not more than a few hundreds.    There are at present some660,000 non-industrial civil servants.    The Post Office, which employsnearly half the total number of non-industrial civil servants and is alsothe Department whose work offers the greatest scope for the employment of coloured people, employs 175 of them in an established capacity and about 400 as temporaries.3. As regards recruitment to the permanent Civil Service, theCivil Service Commission know the complexion of candidates only if thecompetition includes an interview.    The Commission estimate that in1952 only 6 coloured candidates were successful among 46,000 taking partin such competitions, which fill posts in the intermediate and higher grades, representing less than one third of the Service.    Any estimate ofthe number of coloured people likely to enter the Civil Service year by year must obviously be very tentative. .  But on the information available it is thought that there may be, say, 20 to 40 coloured people entering &amp;e*cb.year, nearly all of them in the lower grades.No real difficulties4. Although there have been some difficulties over the assignment of one or two individuals, coloured candidates are not a serious problem for the Civil Service Commission. They are not so easy to place as white recruits, of course.    The Service Departments, for example,1-
would not regard coloured candidates as being &quot;qualified in all respects&quot;to undertake the duties which would be required of therru    But they are normally assigned without undue difficulty.    Once assigned they do not seem to have given rise to any particular trouble, at any rate so far.There have been no representations from the National Staff Side on thisquestion,5. Over the Service as a whole, therefore, the employment of coloured civil servants has not given rise to much difficulty, and there seemsto be no reason to expect that it will do so in the future.Methods of restricting the entry of coloured people to the Civil ServiceTemporary Staff6. Temporary staff are recruited through the Ministry of Labour.And, if it were so desired, instructions could be issued banning the sub-mission to Departments of coloured people for employment as temporaries.This would deprive the Service (and the Post Office in particular) of onesource of recruitment, but the numbers are so small that this would not greatly matter. The instruction could be given administratively and without-publicity. It would, however, sooner or later become public knowledge that a ban was being operated.Established Staff7. Established civil servants are  recruited by the Civil service commission under published Regulations governing the eligibility of candidates in respect of age, health, nationality, qualifications etc.    Itwould not be possible to revise the Regulations in such a way as to excludecoloured candidates effectively from eligibility for established Civil Serviceappointment without coming out into the open about it in one way or another.If we were prepared to come out into the open, then no doubt it would bepossible to make arrangements to exclude the coloured candidates.    but even so it would not be easy -  if only because of the difficulty of defininga coloured person - and there would undoubtedly be many practicaldifficulties for the Civil Service Commission and the Treasury.General8. The introduction of a colour bar for recruitment to the CivilService, whether of established or temporary staff, would be a signaldeparture from the traditional policy of non-discrimination which has been endorsed by successive Governments.    It would be inconsistent with recentstatements in the House and elsewhere by Government spokesmen.    Itcould hardly fail to excite considerable adverse comment, not only in thiscountry, but in the Commonwealth, the United Nations and elsewhere,,    Itwould, moreover, be inconsistent with present policy under which coloured people are liable to call-up in the United Kingdom on the same basis as allother United Kingdom residents (i. e. after two years residence) and areentitled to be considered for commissioned rank in all three Armed Services,
conclusion. I conclude that there is little danger of the eligibility of coloured persons for employment in the Civil Service presenting anythingbut a minor practical problem so far as the Civil Service is concerned,,On the other hand, any discrimination against them would either have to be,or become, overt and would involve difficulties of principle out of all proportion to any practical advantage which the Civil Service might derive from it.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1. ,1ST FEBRUARY, 1954.
