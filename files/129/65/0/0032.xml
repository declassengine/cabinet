logPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1954Qmmr OFFICE Copy No.    ggU)PYCABINETPAY OF THE ARMED forces memorandum by the Minister of Defence, the First Lord of the Admiralty,the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for AirWe have no option but to submit to the Cabinet proposals for increases in service pay. These increases are needed to meet the urgent manning needs of all three Services and to maintain a reasonable relativity with civil life. We firstapproached the Chancellor of the Exchequer last June, but we have been unable toreach agreement in the discussions which we have since had with him. The increases should be announced in the Defence White Paper. We must be in a position to dealwith questions about the manning position and criticism of the present rates ofService pay in the course of Debates which will take place in both Houses earlyin March.2. The pay of the armed forces was last reviewed in 1950 and new rates were introduced with effect from 1st September of that year.&quot; The increases for regularsailors, soldiers and airmen ranged from 3s. a day for privates to 6s. a day for seniorN.C.O.S (Cmd. 8027).  All ranks of officers also received increases.3. Since 1950, civilian earnings have gone steadily ahead, keeping pace with-and, indeed, slightly out-distancing increases in the cost of living. Betweenmid-1950 and mid-1953 the cost-of-living index rose by 25 points or 23 per cent.;average civilian earnings rose by 28 per cent. The pay of the armed forces has remained pegged to the economic levels of 1950. We thus have the contrast betweenlarge and rapid movements in civilian wages and earnings and a standstill in service pay.4. These figures take no account of recent increases or of current wage negotiations. In C. (53) 363 the Minister of Labour indicated that it was unlikelythat current claims would be settled for less than a 7s. a week increase. On this assumption civilian earnings will shortly be over 30 per cent, higher than in mid-1950.5. The progressive departure from the relativity established in 1950 is affectingthe ability of the Services to hold and recruit men. The recruiting position is unsatisfactory; the holding position is becoming critical. The core of any ArmedService must be its medium- and long-term regulars. These provide the experience,skill&quot; and esprit de corps without which a Service will disintegrate. They are the source from which the experienced N.C.O. and skilled tradesman must be found.Many more regulars must be persuaded to stay much longer with the colours. Itis the skilled and experienced men who are wanted, but it is these men who canmost easily find more attractive employment in civil life. Movement, disturbanceand a certain amount of family separation are an inevitable feature of Servicelife. Our repeatedly changing world commitments accentuate this feature, whichplaces a heavy strain on the regular, whether married or single. The former, inparticular, is under constant pressure from his wife to secure a job which does not involve frequent movement and separation.6. Annex &quot; A &quot; sets out the current man-power problems of each Serviceand gives examples of the most serious deficiencies facing them.45587 bCONFIDENTIALC. (54) 3229th January, 1954
7. The Navy is losing its seamen and stokers so quickly and the replacementrate is so low that the size and operational capacity of the active Fleet may soon be determined by this factor alone and.not.by.general defence policy.8. The Army is suffering from a 40 per cent, shortage in its essential nucleus of regulars with six and more years&apos; service. Overall, the shortage of warrant officers and non-commissioned officers is 21 per cent. For corporals it is 30 percent, and this is particularly serious because in due course it will be reflected inthe ranks of sergeant and above. There is a great shortage of regular tradesmenin certain vital trades. The efficiency of the Army for both &quot; cold war &quot; and &quot; hotwar &quot; purposes is in serious jeopardy.9. In the RAP. there has already been a critical loss to industry of skilledfitters and supervisors, with the result that such key men as remain are seriouslyoverworked. This is beginning to affect the serviceability of aircraft and to restrict the hours flown in certain Commands. Unless the present trend can be reversed,we must run the risk of an increase in flying accidents or impose restrictions onflying which would seriously interfere with the operational efficiency of squadrons.10. With these considerations in mind my Service colleagues and i are satis-fied that a major revision of Service pay is essential. We consider that the relativityestablished in 1950 between civilian and Service emoluments was right and fair.But to maintain it for all ranks would, we estimate, cost nearly  50 millions;moreover we do not consider that increases are essential at every point. We have,therefore, rejected the idea of an all-round increase on this scale in favour of selective proposals designed to give the greatest benefit where the Service needsare greatest. We propose no general increase for the national service man, norfor the regular private soldier or equivalent during his first three years. In ourview the most economical and satisfactory solution to our problem will be togive increases as a reward for skill and experience. This is what we propose.There will be increases for tradesmen, particularly the most highly skilled, andfor N.C.O.s; and, in addition, increments for service so that all ranks will receive some tangible benefit to encourage them to stay in the Service.11. We estimate that our proposals for other ranks will cost about 15f millions (details are given in Annex &quot;B&quot;; Annex &quot;C&quot; shows how theproposals will affect typical cases).12. With regard to officers, the problem is not so much that sufficient candi-dates for commissions are not coming forward (though this is the case in certain branches) but that the quality of those who offer themselves has deteriorated over recent years. This is happening at a time when the personal qualities of leadershipand the intellectual capacity to cope with increasingly technical equipment demandan even higher standard for candidates for commissions in all three Services.Clearly the supply of candidates with these qualifications is bound to be influenced by the. greater attractions which the better-remunerated professions in civil lifehow offer compared with a career in the armed forces. Moreover, the conditionsof Service life are becoming increasingly difficult for the married officer, particularlyin the middle ranks, who is nowadays subject to frequent and inevitable movesall over the world which disrupt his family life and present him with a seriouseducational problem for his children.13. We are clear that a strong case exists for an overall increase for officersof the three Services in all ranks. But in order to limit the financial cost of our proposals, we are now asking (apart from certain consequential increases for officers promoted from the ranks) only for an increase in basic pay of between5s, and Is. a day for the &quot; middle piece &quot; officer, i.e., from Captain to Brigadier or equivalent. It is in these ranks, and particularly for married officers, that the shoepinches most. We estimate the cost of the officer proposals at about  5-^ millions a year. i14. My Service colleagues and I have discussed our proposals at length withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and have been unable to reach agreement. TheChancellor holds that there is little ground on merits for any general increase.In substance, he claims that the 1950 settlement was so generous that the large increases in wages and earnings over the last three years have only just bridgedthe gap then created. We reject this argument completely. While the 1950settlement was welcomed as a good though belated settlement, nowhere was itdescribed as excessive or extravagant. The days when regular sailors, soldiers and.
airmen could be got on the cheap are long past. The Services are in realcompetition with civilian industry and this is a hard fact which must be faced.15. We feel bound to reinforce our arguments by a warning. In our view,experience shows that any small increase is likely to be money largely wasted. Ifwe are now penny wise and pound foolish over Service pay we shall fail to stemthe present alarming manpower trends and we shall leave the Services with a sense of gross injustice when they compare their treatment with that of civilians.16. We feel bound also to draw attention to the position of the police. In1949, constables received an increase in pay of 22s. a week (the Oaksey award); inthe autumn of 1951 they received an increase in pay of 21s. a week (the TrustramEve award). This year constables have been given a further increase of aboutYls. a week and ranks up to Chief Inspector slightly more, for reasons which seemto us very similar to those which justify our proposals for the Services. To give anincrease of 17s. a week or 2s. 6d. a day to all regular sailors, soldiers and airmen,would cost about  21 millions.  We are asking for  15f millions for other ranks.17. As we attach so much importance to improving Service pay, we should beprepared, in the event of a satisfactory settlement, to discuss in a helpful spiritwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether the Service Departments could in1954-55 find some part of the cost of pay increases from within the sum of 1,640 millions which he has already accepted for the Defence Budget for thatyear.18.   To sum up. We submit that:  (a) There is an unanswerable case for substantial pay improvements for the armed forces.(b) The needs of the Services will best be met if in the case of other ranks thereare selective increases designed primarily to reward skill and experience.(c) For other ranks, increases on the lines of those set out at Annex &quot; B&quot; andcosting about  15J millions should be approved in principle.(d) For officers from Captain to Brigadier or equivalent, increases in basic pay of between 5s. and 7s. a day and costing about  5^ millions should be approved in principle.A.J.

IM;,M; ANNEX &quot;A&quot;   .Royal NavyA. Extension of Special Service (7 year) ratingsNearly one, half of total regular rating strength consists of seven-year men.Indications are that only 10 in 100 are deciding to remain in the Navy only in 100 in the Seaman and Stoker Mechanic branches..; This heavy loss will have serious consequences on the numbers of experiencedratings available.B. Regular RecruitingRecruiting has fallen short of the target of about 10,000 a year as follows:  1951-52 ...      ..........       9 per cent.1952-53 ............      13 per cent.Current year   ............      16 per cent.(the shortfall in the Seaman and Stoker Mechanic branches is now 27 per cent.).The loss of ratings on completion of seven years&apos; service will mean a substantial increase in recruiting requirements, which are already not being attained.C.-Re-engagement at 12 years (i.e., for pension)Owing to drastic curtailment of regular recruiting during the war, the numbersof men completing twelve years&apos; service are very low and an exceptionally highre-engagement rate is necessary. Only 40 out of every 100 ratings eligible tore-engage are, however, doing so.D. The Basic Branches-Seaman and Stoker MechanicThe above factors all affect the important Seaman and Stoker Mechanicbranches with particular force. The result is to increase regular recruiting needsof these branches to about 2,000 a year each if minimum naval commitments areto be met. Only about 1,100 recruits are, however, being obtained in each case.This figure underlines the absolute necessity of stepping up re-engagements and extensions to the point when recruitment will satisfy requirements.ArmyA. -Shortage of Men of Medium Length ServiceIf the Army is to be an efficient force it must contain an adequate proportion(about 17  per cent.) of men with over six years&apos; service.During the past three years the percentage of such men has fallen from 18 percent, in 1950 to 10 per cent, in 1953. Even allowing for the effect of the RadicalReview the Army will need more than 60,000 such men in future; at present ithas only 40,000.The difficulty of making good this deficiency is considerable. The men who now take on regular engagements commit themselves for only three years. Theythink it worth while to do this because by thus serving for only one year morethan they are compelled to do by the National Service Act they secure variousadvantages, including full regular rates of pay throughout their service. But thereis at present very little inducement for them to stay on after the initial three years.B. Shortage of Warrant Officers and N.C.O.SThe present percentage deficiencies of Warrant Officers and N.CO.s on current needs are:-Warrant Officer II    ...      ...... 4 per cent.Staff/Sergeant ...      ...      ...      ... 21 per cent.Sergeant         ............ 18 per cent.Corporal         ............ 30 per cent.The position with regard to corporals is particularly serious. Not only hasthe deficiency increased from 24 per cent, to 30 per cent, since May 1952, but
the number of corporals who are prolonging their service is falling steadily. since a large number of the Warrant Officers and N.C.O.S of the future will be drawn from the present corporals, the present trend, if not arrested, will very shortlyaffect the upper N.C.O. structure.C. Shortage of Skilled Tradesmen in Certain Vital TradesThe problem here is not so much an overall shortage as a shortage of regulartradesmen, in particular Class I and Class II tradesmen, in certain vital trades.With the exception of the supervisory appointments (e^g., armament artificers)which are confined to regulars, the majority of men in these trades are nationalservice men. They are not an acceptable substitute for regulars since they lackexperience and knowledge of the Army; and many of them never rise aboveClass III. The Army must have an adequate number of regular tradesmen inorder: (a) to carry out the day-to-day work which is beyond the capabilities of class III national service tradesmen, (b) to train adequate numbers for senior N.C.O.posts later, and (c) to provide a reasonable measure of continuity within each trade.Royal Air ForceK-Shortage and Low Average of Skill in Certain Vital TradesAdvanced tradesmen of the first four trade groups are responsible for servicingand maintaining aircraft and their equipment. The present requirement is 28,000,against which there are some 20,000, i.e., 72 per cent. The current strength of this vital sector is actually less, and the ratio of strength to requirements is considerably less, than it was in July 1950.The decline in experience is even worse than the shortage of numbers. At thepresent time four out of every five of these men are leaving the Service when their current engagements run out.The loss of W.O.S and senior N.C.O.S is particularly disquieting. Out of ,400, all of whom ought to be on re-engaged service, 1,400 have not re-engagedand are likely to be lost to the R.A.F. During the period from April to December1953, 850 W.O.S and senior N.C.O.S were lost. This means a loss rate of 15 per cent,per annum.B. Failure of Short-term Men in all Trade Groups to Extend or Re-engageWhile the strength of regulars has increased in the last three years from 90,000to 160,000, this increase is accounted for almost entirely by men who have enteredon three-year engagements as an alternative to national service. The number ofmen on twelve-year engagements has been practically stationary and the numberOf those who have re-engaged for pension has increased only by 7,400. Thenumber of men on pensionable engagements, i.e., 20,000, is still only 12 per cent,of the regular strength and 8 per cent, of the total strength. It should be at leastdouble that figure.Less than 1 per cent, of three-year men sign on for more than five years and only 12 per cent of five-year men sign on for further service, mostly for ten ortwelve years.C. Heavy Burden of Training Necessitated by Rapid TurnoverThe failure to build up a long service cadre exacts a heavy price in inflatedtraining establishments and locks up skill and experience which could otherwise beemployed in front-line units. At present there is one airman or airwoman under-going training in the ground trades for every four-and-a-half of the trained strength.The entry of 71,000 forecast for 1954-55 represents 25 per cent, of the total strength.In the first four Trade Groups it has been necessary to draft to long advancedtraining courses men who will have as little as two years&apos; unexpired service before discharge. This will improve the numerical position, but adds nothing toexperience. Unless a high proportion of these men can be persuaded to stay inthe Service, this process must be continued indefinitely.
