MIDDLE EAST RE-DEPLOYMENT;MOVE OF JOINT HEADQUARTERS TO Cyprus memorandum, by the Minister of DefeneeIn the Annex to their paper on Middle East Defence, C. (54) 9, theChiefs of Staff set out their plan for re-deployment of land and air forces,should an agreement be reached with Egypt.    These forces would consistof an armoured division, divided between Libya, Jordan and Cyprus, andof eight air squadrons stationed in Iraq, Jordan, Cyprus and Aden.    TheJoint Headquarters would be in Cyprus.    Naval forces would be unaffected.2.        The process of re-deployment will take eighteen months.    On theassumption that there would be an interval of at least three months betweenreaching agreement on principles with the Egyptians and the ratification of a detailed agreement, we have accepted that the period of re-deploymentshould be specified in the detailed agreement as fifteen months from thedate of ratification.    I am now considering what could be done to acceleratere-deployment if the interval proved to be less than three months.    In any event, the time-table will be extremely tight, and it is most important that ministers should specifically approve the Chiefs of Staff plan as a firmbasis for future action.    Proposals involving expenditure will, of course,be put to the Treasury in the normal way.&apos; &quot; &apos;.  &apos;   .. &apos;;      / \&apos;&apos;&apos; ;.&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;3.        I should perhaps make it clear that the re-deployment plan wouldnot be materially altered even if it were decided that we should evacuateEgypt completely.4.        Under the re-deployment plan, the Joint Headquarters will move to Cyprus.    The Cabinet approved this move in principle in December, 1952,and agreed that preliminary work on the preparation of the Headquarters in cyprus should be commenced (C. C, (52) 101st Conclusions, Minute 9).    Atthat time the proposed establishment of the Joint Headquarters was approximately 4,200, and I was asked to re-examine this and submit tothe Cabinet revised estimates of the Service personnel and civilians for whom accommodation would be required.5.        This has now been done.    I have assumed that the re-deploymentplan put forward by the Chiefs of Staff will be accepted; that our politicalcommitments to Jordan, Iraq and other Middle East States will remain unaltered; that East Africa will remain an independent Command, so faras the Army is concerned; and that all establishments must be reducedto an absolute minimum.6.        On this basis, and after consultation with the Chiefs of Staff, i recommend that the establishment of the Joint Headquarters should be amaximum of 2,500     Details are shown in the Annex.    Some adjustmentsecret CABINET OFFICE, RECORD COPYca(54) Z6 copy no.23rd january, 1954cabinet
between the Services may prove to be necessary, but I am satisfied that theproposed total establishment is the minimum on which the Joint Headquartercan discharge its functions.7.        The present tentative time-table for re-deployment leaves the move of the Headquarters until the end of the fifteen months period, inview of the time required to get the new Headquarters in Cyprus ready0The Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East and the Chiefs of Staff have,however, reached the conclusion that it would on every ground be desirableto remove the Joint Headquarters from Egypt at the earliest practicablestage.    The possibility of using other accommodation in Cyprus for thispurpose temporarily until the new Headquarters are ready is now being examined departmentally, and if some worthwhile scheme can be devisedwithout incurring heavy additional expenditure, I think that it would be most desirable to adopt it.    The Treasury will, of course, be fullyconsulted on its financial aspects.8.        I ask the Cabinet:-(a) To approve the re-deployment plan proposed by theChiefs of Staff, as set out in the Annex to C. (54) 9.(b) To approve a maximum establishment of 2,500 for theJoint Headquarters in Cyprus.(c) To take note that I am considering the possibility ofadvancing the move of the Headquarters from Egyptby the temporary use of other accommodation in cyprus.A.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.23RD JANUARY, 1954.2
