secret, CABINET OFFICE f  /c0(54)4i RECORD COPY copy       &amp;i6TH FEBRUARY, 1954CABINETREPORT OF THE ROYAL, COMMISSIONON BETTING, LOTTERIES AND GAMINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Home Department and Minister for Welsh AffairsThe Cabinet agreed on 19th November (CeC.(53) 68th Conclusions,Minute 8) to resume consideration of my memorandum on off&quot;the-coursebetting (C0(53) 317) at a later meeting.    The matter has now become oneof some urgency, since Mr. Mitchison has given notice that he will movea resolution relating to the Report of the Royal Commission on Betfcing,Lotteries and Gaming on 19th February.    The motion is second order,but the first order, which is on the subject of mental health, may not take the whole of the time, particularly in view of the fact that the subject is to be considered by a Royal Commission.2. I suggested in C. (53) 317 that there should be discussions withthe Opposition as a prelude to a general debate on the Commission^Report.    Now that an Opposition Member has announced his intentionof moving a resolution I think we should not miss the opportunity ofmaking the best use of a discussion in the House on the subject of bettingin a form which is less likely than any other to embarrass the Government,If, moreover, we can persuade the Opposition to give some generalcommendation to the Commission^ proposals, which, as Mr. de Freitasannounced in the debate on the Pool Betting Bill, they have considered&quot;carefully and in detail&quot;, it may eventually become possible to introduce legislation in an atmosphere relatively free from party controversy.3. That such legislation is needed I have no doubt.    The importantrecommendations of the Royal Commission are those about the controlof pool betting and the legalisation of cash betting off the course.The proceedings on the Pool Betting Bill on 29th January and the news&quot;paper reactions to them have shown that there is strong support for theproposals about pool betting, and I think that it may be difficult to resist pressure to introduce Government legislation on this subject next session if the Pool Betting Bill makes no further progress.    Thelegalisation of cash betting is a much more controversial issue, but therewas impressive support for it in the evidence given before the RoyalCommission, including the evidence of the Lord Chief Justice, the ChiefMagistrate of the Metropolis, the Chief Constables1 Association and thePolice Federations.    Soon after the Report was published the archbishop of Canterbury published a letter in his Diocesan Gazettein which he said &quot;I am inclined to support the Commissionsrecommendation myself, though very reluctantly and subject to moresafeguards and restrictions than the Royal Commission suggests:  thereis an unanswerable case for a change in the present law, v/hich is unjustas between rich and poor and which cannot be enforced: the cure offered
ITUby the betting office may prove worse than the disease, but it seemsto me worth trying, subject to very strict controls&quot;.40 The consideration to which I attach the greatest importance is the very serious danger to the morale of the police which must always be present while illegal forms of betting continue on so large: a scale,,   I have recently had to consider a number of appeals from police officers in Leeds against punishments imposed on them for acceptingmoney from bookmakers carrying on illegal businesses and we are running a grave risk of widespread corruption if we do nothing to amend the law about cash, bettings5. I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will agree that I shouldhave discussions with the Opposition before Mr,  Mitch eoa.:s resolution is debated in which I would seek to secure an agreement that both theGovernment and the official Opposition spokesman should indicateagreement with the general conclusion of the Royal Commission that thelaw must be amended by legalising the provision of facilities for cashbetting off the course subject to a strict system of control, which would include the registration of bookmakers engaged in this form of business;but that neither party is committed at this stage to the acceptance ofthe Royal Commission^ detailed recommendations on control.D.M.F,Home Office, S.W.1. ,5TH FEBRUARY, 1954.
