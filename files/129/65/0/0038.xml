CONFIDENTIAL, CABINET office.(54) 38 RECORD COPY        copy no.6J1ST. FEBRUARY, 1954CABINETPAY OF THE ARMED forces memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerWhile I am prepared to agree to modest and selective increases in service pay, I cannot advise the Cabinet to accept the proposals put forward by the Minister of Defence and the Service Ministers in C, (54) 32.General Level of Service Pay2.        I do not accept the contention that a case exists for a general increase in Service pay which might cost as much as  50 millions.    the increases in pay which were given in 1950 were much larger than were necessary to take account of movements in outside wages at that time.The very considerable increases in 1950 were largely intended as an inducement to secure the rapid and substantial increase in the regularstrength of the Forces then required and were so described at the time.I accordingly cannot agree that increases in civilian earnings since 1950establish a case for corresponding increases in Service pay.    Nor,unfortunately, am I in agreement with the Service Ministers on the weight to be given to various factors in seeking to compare Service pay withcivilian earnings.    In particular I consider that the Service Departmentsseriously under-value the goods and services that are provided to aServiceman in kind - which, incidentally, have become more valuablesince 1950.3.        Pay plus marriage allowance and ration allowance for the averagemarried private is about 230 per cent more than it was in 193 8.    Thefigure for a sergeant would be just under 200 per cent.    The correspondingaverage figure for the adult male civil worker is 169 per cent.    Comparisonsbetween the pay of civilian workers and Servicemen in 1946 and to-day arealso favourable to the Serviceman.4.        Service Ministers mention the recent increases in police pay.A constable&apos;s pay at  445 to-day represents an increase of  263 a year,or 144 per cent above the pre-war rate of  182.    The police sergeant, at 590, is getting 127 per cent above the pre-war rate of  260.    Even theminimum pay of an unmarried Army sergeant, who does not draw anyallowances (though he, of course, gets his keep), has increased from 6/-a day in 1938 to l6/6d. to-day, i.e. by 175 per cent, with almost completeprotection against the rise in the cost of necessities.5.        When it is considered that a Warrant Officer of eight yearsseniority can draw  14 a week or  700 a year in pay, marriage allowance and ration allowance, and a sergeant about  10 a week, or  500 a year,without putting any value whatever to items like travel, clothing or pension
rights, compared with national average earnings for men of about  9 5s.a week, or  480 a year, it is evident that the days when regular sailors,soldiers and airmen could be &quot;got on the cheap&quot;, as the Service Ministersput it, are already recognised as long past.6.        Admittedly the Service Ministers, having developed a case on general grounds, do not ask for a general increase;  but there are veryserious risks in ba.sing substantial pay increases on general economic considerations and then applying those increases in a broadly selectivemanner to remedy particular manning difficulties.    Some 60 per cent ofthe regulars in the Armed Forces would benefit,    The risks of awardingsuch widespread increases, which would give between  2 and  3 a weekmore pay to many and nothing at all to the lowest paid, are clearaPressures might soon develop to give a general rise on the grounds used by the Service Ministers, which are clearly of general application and not limited to N. Ce Os.    If a general increase had to be given, it would have tobe given to allj, to avoid disturbing the new relativities established by thepresent proposals, and I would then have had to find the money for two payrises instead of one.7.        The only proper step, if the increases are primarily directed tothe easement of manning difficulties, is to devise narrowly selectiveincreases which can be seen by the men themselves to be, and be publiclypresented as being, designed solely for that purpose.SciontiJ4^ Problems Facing the services.        The Treasury have examined in great detail with the service departments the nature of the difficulties with which the Services are faced.The appreciation which follows is based on a careful analysis of all theavailable information and statistics though, obviously, I cannot burden mycolleagues with the detail.Navy9,        Admittedly there is a need for improvements designed to dealwith the shortages in the Seaman and the Stoker Mechanic branches, and tosecure a specially high rate of transfer for the men enlisted on special service (seven-year) engagements soon after the war, because of the concentration - unfortunate, as it turned out - on this type of engagementbetween 1946 and 1949.    But the proposals which have been put to theTreasury do not deal selectively with these problems;  on the contrary,the Admiralty have proposed pay increases for all ranks above A0 B. inall branches, and have proposed bigger increases in the ranks of PettyOfficer and Chief Petty Officer than for&apos;Leading Seaman, though in fact the re-engagement and extension rate for the first two ranks is much better than for the last-named.Army10.        The proportion of men with over six years&apos; service is much lower than is considered desirable.    But this springs largely from a lackof regular recruiting on the normal scale in the war years.    Any man with over six years1 service to-day was recruited before 1947, mainlyduring the war years or before 1939, and it is clear that men of six years&apos;service cannot simply be created.    I accept that the implication of thisis that a higher proportion of the small field now available needs to beretained to offset this.    But this sort of problem does not seem to call for changes over nearly the whole pay structure.    I have already indicated
my readiness to concede improvements in the botinties given for extensions of service and am ready also to look at others which are specificallydirected to the man with three to six years&apos; service, or to the really skilledtradesman in vital trades,RsAoF.11. Similarly, for the R. A, F. I am prepared to agree to improvements in the bounties paid to serving men on signing on for long (pensionable)engagements; but I understand that the Air Ministry will not accept this offer unless the increased rates are paid retrospectively to men who havealready signed on for a smaller inducement.    I could not accept suchretrospective application of new terms of service, as a matter of principle.I am also ready to agree to pay increases specifically directed towards the advanced trades in which the most acute shortages are felt.    But I cannot accept that the general trend is so unsatisfactory (the number of men onpensionable engagements has increased by 50 per cent over the last threeyears, for example) that increases for all Nc C. Os. of all trade groups a.ndof all levels of skill are called for.All three Services12.       In 1938 a sergeanfs minimum was 6/- a day:  to-day it is l6/6d.The minimum 1938 rate for a Warrant Officer I was 12/-: to-day it is22/6d.    The sergeanfs lead over the private in pay alone (i,e. ignoringallowances) has increased from 4/- a day to 9/6d. a day; that of the warrant Officer I from 10/- a day to 15/6d. a day.    All the statistical information furnished by the Service Departments has shown that their difficulties are most serious at about the level of the man with three to six years&apos; service, who is most likely to be a corporal or the equivalent in the other Services,    Indeed, the Service Ministers stress this themselvesin Annex A to their paper.    Yet their proposals give very   much largerincreases to senior N,C, Os.    For example, a typical Army corporal would get an increase of 22/6d. a week, a sergeant 35/- a week and a warrant Officer I 42/- a week.    In the proposed new group X the riseswould be as much as 45/6d. a week for a sergeant and 52/od, for a warrant officer I.    To these increases must be added at least the increase of /- a week in ration allowance already conceded since 1950.    I am sure that increases of this order are not called for, even at the lower levels,and that the further steep gradation for the higher ranks is unjustified.Officers13.        The case originally put to me by the Minister of Defence referredonly to other ranks.    I was somewhat surprised to receive at a later dateproposals for pay increases for officers as well.    The services are notalone among the professions in thinking that there may have been somefall in the quality of new entrants in recent years.    I think I am entitledto reserve my position until more specific evidence of difficulties inmanning is made available, and this has not been done apart from thevery general observations set out in paragraph 12 of C, (54) 32,    I havealready granted substantial increases, on cause shown, to the Medical and dental Branches,    At the moment my understanding is that most branchesin the Army are running into a position where they have too many officersin the rank of Major,    On the general position with regard to officers&apos;pay, so far as can be judged, the rate of increase which they enjoy ascompared with pre-war compares favourably with other classes of professional employment and with other Crown servants, especially whenthe effect of accelerated time promotion is taken into account, as itlegitimately can be.
R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S,W, 1,.1ST FEBR.UARY, 1954.(i)(ii)14.        I have not referred to my budgetary difficulties or to the reper-cussions of substantial increase in Service pay on the general industrial situation, because I believe that, on merits^ a solution can be found which need not seriously embarrass us in either aspect.15.        I suggest that the Service Departments and the Treasury should beasked to work out selective proposals designed to deal with the more serious problems affecting the Services.    I originally offered to agree tohighly selective increases which would in the aggregate have cost about 2 millions a year.    I have recently indicated to the Service ministers that I would be prepared, though with misgiviags, to consider a higher amountof the order of  6 millions to  8 millions,    I could not contemplate ahigher figure than  8 millions and I suggest that any concessions of this order should be subject to three conditionsthat the Service Ministers will not press for theso-called &quot;morale-boosters&quot; - free air travelfrom the Canal Zone and so forth - which were put before the Defence Committee some time ago and have now been raised again in C. (54) 35.that the new rates be regarded as establishing theproper relativity for men in the Forces over 21and their civilian counterparts and that on this basis officials of the Departments concerned nowagree upon a rational basis of comparison betweenService and civilian earnings for future use.    Theabsence of this has bedevilled all discussion on service pay since 1950,(iii) that half of the cost of the increases comes out ofthe Defence Budget of  1,635 millions fixed for1954/55.
