SECRET &apos;C.(54) 131ITH JANUARY, 1954..PROSPECTS FOR THE BERLIN MEETINGMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsGereral BackgroundMy colleagues will wish to know how I view the prospects for the meeting of the four Foreign Ministers in Berlin on 25th January.There has been careful consultation and preparation between the three western Governments and also with the German Federal Government andthe Austrian Government.    This has revealed basic agreement on policyand tactics.2. Soviet and Western policies on Germany, the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) and the European defence community (E.D.C.) were analysed by the Lord President of the Councilin C, (53) 187 which my colleagues considered before the Washington Talks(C,C.(53) 39th Conclusions, Minute 2) and with which I am in full agree-ment.    This paper brought out the grave dangers of any solution of theGerman problem based on neutralisation.    There is no reason to suppose that Soviet policy has altered since in any important respect.COPY NO. 7S&apos;-j-CABINETSoviet objectives in Europe3. For the Soviet Government, the principal obstacle to their plans in Europe is the presence of American troops and Americaninfluence on the Continent.    The military and political strength of theUnited States in Europe will be consolidated if Germany is drawn intothe Western system and raises forces to assist in We stern defence.Soviet policy in Europe thus hi*s two main purposes:-(i)  To obtain American withdrawal from europe, thus fatally weakening theWestern alliance;(ii) to prevent the resurgence of a strongunited Germany integrated with theWest.We stern objectives in Europe4. The most important requirement for the Western Powers,on the other hand, is to reach agreement on the reunification of germany as a free, democratic State looking towards the West and able and willingto associate itself with the West in the E.D.C., etc.    When we originally
*4lproposed a meeting of Foreign Ministers at the time of the washington talks, it was our intention that the E.D.C, would be in existence before theopening of any conference.    Our task would then have been to reachsatisfactory arrangements with the Russians in the light of this fait accompli.But the hesitations of the French Parliament, which may be partlyascribed to the Soviet Union!s less intransigent international behaviour,have prevented this.Handling of the German problem at Berlin5, The main positive We stern objectives in Berlin will be tomake progress towards a German Peace Treaty and to conclude theAustrian Treaty,    An important negative objective will be to ensure that french ratification of the E.D.C. treaty is not further delayed by the berlin Conference.    We must avoid creating the impression that we(and more particularly the Americans) are in such a hurry to get on withthe E,D,C, that we are not aiming at serious negotiation on Germany and austria.    We must therefore establish the position that we, unlike theRussians, have a practical plan for German reunification, which would produce a representative all-German Government with which alone a peace treaty can be negotiated.    This must be based on free, all-Germanelections as the essential first step,6. We should then be able to counter the Soviet thesis thata peace treaty should be negotiated without delay but with anunrepresentative Provisional all-German Government selected from theexisting Federal Government and the discredited Soviet Zone regime.The subsequent organisation of elections would be left entirely to thesetwo groups of Germans, without any outside supervision.    This Sovietapproach is designed (a) to build up the waning prestige of its puppets inthe Soviet Zone and (b) to create an unrepresentative all-GermanGovernment, including Soviet Zone Communists, which would be prevented from aligning Germany with the West and would be under increasinglystrong Russian influence.    The Western approach has the support of allthe major political parties in the Federal Republic and in Berlin, whoregard the Soviet alternative as completely unacceptable.7. We must also resist any Soviet proposals aiming atGerman neutralisation or at a return to four-Power control of Germany.In short, we must adhere firmly to the principles (i) that an all-GermanGovernment with which we can negotiate a peace treaty can only emerge from free elections, and (ii) that this all-German Government must beable to choose its own international associations provided that they are not inconsistent with the United Nations Charter.    This policy is in line withthat pursued by the three Western Governments at the last four-PowerMinisterial meeting with the Soviet Government in 1949 and with theprovisions of the Bonn Conventions, which I signed in 1951.    On these principles there can be no compromise.Tactics(i) Introductory8, At the outset, and if possible before the probable wrangleon the agenda has begun, the Western Powers propose to take theinitiative by giving in broad outline their views on Germany, Austria andthe problem of security, and so leading up to our practical proposals.The Russians, whose tactics are likely to be to divert us from realistic
consideration of the German and Austrian problems, would presumably setout their thoughts on five-Power talks, causes of international tension,the N.A.T.O., the E.D.C. and United States bases, European security(including German rearmament), and possibly also atomic questions and disarment.    We are committed to listening to the Russians on suchtopics, but not to negotiating upon them at Berlin.    Our first problem will therefore be to avoid spending too much time on these issues in the mainConference and to bring the more detailed discussions to Germany and austrian and European Security in the context of a German settlement.(ii) Germany9, Our general approach has been described in paragraph 5above.    The Western Powers have prepared, in agreement with theFederal Government, practical proposals for the organisation of freeall-German elections and for the establishment first of an all-GermanNational Assembly and then of an all-German Government.    We believethat a minimum of effective precautions, e.g. four-Power preparation andpromulgation of an electoral law, guarantees of freedom of movement forcandidates, voters and press, and above all supervision of the voting andcounting of votes by reliable commissions, preferably including neutralrepresentatives, should enable the East Zone population to register theirvotes freely.    The formation of the all-German Government and, above all, the phasing-out of the existing Federal Government and the East Zoneregime raise greater difficulties, since we wish to avoid a period duringwhich there is no responsible German authority capable of undertaking the international rights and obligations of the existing Federal Government,e. g. membership of the Council of Europe, the Coal and Steel community and possibly of the E.D.C. , and the execution of the Bonn Conventions andof the German Debts Agreements.    Our general idea is that, whilecertain minimum four-Power controls must be retained until the peace treaty, e. g. in respect of the security of the forces in Germany, the timing of this transfer of powers and of German participation in peace treaty negotiations must be left mainly to the future all-German national assembly.(iii) The Problem of Security in Europe10, If we are to convince the world that we are not makingGerman reunification dependent upon conditions obviously unacceptable tothe Russians, we must make it clear that the all-German Governmentwhich results from free elections must be free to decide its own inter-national relationships consistent with the United Nations Charter.    Wemust show that we are not trying to make the adherence of a unitedGermany to the E.D;.C. an absolute condition of our plans for Germanreunification.    Mr. Dulles and Dr. Adenauer, and perhaps M. Bidault,may be a little hesitant on this.    But we should only be following theterms of the Bonn Conventions themselves, to which all four governments are committed.11* While we must make a further attempt to convince theRussians of our peaceful intentions and of our desire to achieve a european settlement acceptable to all, we cannot allow the basic principles of our own security to be called into question.    We shallhowever be ready to consider what further assurances we can give to theSoviet Union in respect.of its own security.    If the atmosphere is favour-able we can develop the general ideas set out in the paper on the problemof security in Europe (C. (54) 10).
12. We shall press for early discussion of the Austrianquestion by the Foreign Ministers with a view to the early conclusion ofthe long overdue Treaty.    We shall refuse to admit that this should be dependant upon progress towards a German Peace Treaty.    The Russians,however, who want a quid pro quo in Germany for concessions in Austria,may continue to argue that this should be discussed through diplomatic channels.(v) Five-Power Conference13. The Russians will press this issue.    It is not suitable fordiscussion in Berlin.    The best and, given the realities of the Americanposition, the only practical way to bring about such a meeting in the nearfuture is through the proposed Political Conference on Korea.    Our own position, and that of the French, is more flexible than that of the Americans,but we must maintain a united front on the above basis.    How we handlethis issue in detail at Berlin must depend upon developments at Panmunjombetween now and then.    It seems that the Communists are preventingprogress in order to help the Russian hand at Berlin.-(vi) Possibilities of Breakdown14. It should be clear after two to three weeks whether anyprogress is possible or whether the Russians are only playing for time inorder to hold up the E.D.C. and the entry into force of the bonn conventions,    If a break is inevitable, it should be on the basic issue ofiree elections in Germany and the formation of a free all-GermanGovernment.  The Russians would no doubt prefer it to be on the issue ofGerman rearmament or even American bases.    It is impossible     lay down at this stage how this difficult problem is to be handled.    Inparticular, we must avoid any impression that the breakdown is caused by american hustling or that we have come to the meeting only to get overan awkward hurdle in the way of the E.D.C.   This would be disastrous toE.D.C. prospects in France.Conclusions15. This analysis may seem rather sombre.    But I do not wish to leave my colleagues under any misapprehension over thedifficulties and dangers of this meeting, desirable though it is as a contribution to the reduction in world tension and to a less abnormalrelationship with the Soviet Union.    Even if we do not succeed in our immediate objectives, we should be able to give and receive some assurance regarding our own and Soviet intentions, and it is probably inthe Soviet as well as in the Western interest to maintain contact and toavoid any aggravation of the cold war after Berlin,    But this must notbe allowed to prevent the West from completing its own security systemrapidly through the ratification of the Bonn and E.D.C, Treaties.Above all Western unity must survive the Conference unimpaired,majesty.Foreign Office, S.W.I. ,11TH JANUARY, 1954.
