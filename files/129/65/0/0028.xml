It is issuedi for the personal use of ............................^W.Vrr^.:.^?.f*?..^TOP SECRET Copy No.31 ||K2827?/? January, J954CABINETRELATIONS BETWEEN THE SHAH AND HER MAJESTY&apos;S EMBASSYAT TEHRANVAvj Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsMy colleagues may recall from the Tehran telegrams that, immediately upon VJwJj^^fl his arrival, Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Aifaires was approached by two persons whoclaimed to represent the Shah. They told Mr. Wright that the Shah wished to dealftffl on &quot; high policy matters &quot; direct with the British Embassy and not through Persian KfAfJCabinet Ministers. Mr. Wright replied that he could not negotiate secretly withIhe Shah without the knowledge of the Prime Minister or the Minister for ForeignAffairs, whom he later informed of the approach made by these unofficial inter-mediaries. The Minister for Foreign Affairs was grateful for this frankness andsaid he would take the matter up with the Shah on the latter&apos;s return to the capital.2.  The Shah has now returned and my colleagues may be interested to see VJwJjthe annexed letter from Mr. Wright describing His Majesty&apos;s present feelings, which,as so often, are not such as to do him much credit. I have told Mr. Wright that IVaVJ fully approve of his attitude in this matter. V^H^^fl (Signed)        A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,21st January, 1954.British Embassy, Tehran,January 16, 1954.ftwjfl The Shah returned this week from the Caspian. Henderson (the United StatesAmbassador) saw him the following day (January 14th) and told me that he foundhim in a difficult and rather sullen mood. He gave the impression of being veryjealous of Zahedi and of being peeved with me for exposing his Perron-Shahrukhintrigues to Entezam. Henderson thought, too, that the Shah suspected him ofplaying some part in the exposure.At the same time the Shah showed some annoyance that we should be rushingBffl ahead with the appointment of an Ambassador. Henderson naturally pointed outthe very good reasons why we wanted an Ambassador here as soon as possible.?JwJ This mood of the Shah, and particularly his jealousy of Zahedi and irritationwith me, has been confirmed from secret sources also.I don&apos;t think we need take any of this too tragically, but it may mean that j^^Hthe Shah will not wish to see me in the immediate future, and of course I cannot AfAfjinsist. In view of this, after I have made my statement about the oil negotiations?vfl to Entezam, I propose seeing Ala, will make the same statement to him, and remind |^^Hhim of his earlier suggestion that I should see the Shah as soon as possible.(Signed)        D.
