JANUARY, 1954CABINETTRADE WITH THE SOVIET BLOC-SECURITY EXPORT controls memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign affairs at their meeting on 17th November the Cabinet agreed that,in discussion with representatives of the United States Government, anattempt should be made to secure United States agreement to a &quot;short list&quot;of goods to be subject to security export controls (C,C.(53) 67th Conclusions,Minute 6).    This proposal has been discussed with american representatives at the official level.    It was also discussed between theEconomic Secretary, Treasury and Mr. Stassen, Director of the UnitedStates Foreign Operations Administration, during the latter&apos;s visit to paris for the North Atlantic Council meeting.Z, These discussions and an official communication from theUnited States Government have shown that the United States Governmentare firmly opposed to the substitution for the present lists of a &quot;short list&quot;of the kind which we have suggested to them.    On the other hand, they appear less rigidly opposed than in the past to some reduction in the .present lists.3. There are certain fields, to which the Americans, and we our-selves, attach great importance such as electronics, in which there is un-likely to be much scope for reducing the present limitations.    But further discussion may show that there are other fields in which fairly sub-stantial reductions of controls might be possible.    A particular case isthat of rubber exports to the U.S.S.R. and the satellites; the United Kingdom aas the only member of the Paris Group with a major concern in rubberexports, has operated quota restrictions which in practice have beenfrustrated through the availability of rubber from other sources in SouthEast Asia.    In this and in other cases where the same type of considerations apply, we may well find the United States Governmentreceptive.    The recent statements to the Press by Mr. Stassen haverevealed a desire to educate United States public opinion in favour of an expansion of trade with the Soviet bloc and a reduction of securityexport controls. ,4. So long as we confine our proposal to the adoption of a &quot;shortlist&quot;, we are unlikely to make substantial progress with the Americans since it will appear to them to raise issues of principle which they will be unableto accept.    But if we take up with them the question of reducing thepresent lists by the exclusion of the less important items, or of those ofwhich the present control is ineffective, we may make better progresssince the Americans have already indicated their readiness to accept somepruning of the existing lists.-1-
5. I have therefore come to the conclusion that we should, for thepresent, suspend discussion of the &quot;short list&quot; as such, and should accept that in the near future we cannot expect to secure United States agreement to a list as short as we originally had in mind.    Instead we should discuss with them the best method of reviewing the present lists with the object of excluding the less important strategic items.    We would offer to putforward concrete cases of items or groups of items, the controls on whichare either out of date, or ineffective, or impede trade more than the strategic importance of the items warrants.    By dealing with itemsseparately in this way and keeping the argument to the relevant facts ineach particular case, we may well find that we can make greater and more rapid progress than by seeking agreement on matters of principle,6. It is naturally impossible to say in advance how far we may beable to bring the Americans along this line.    As on all previous occasionsthe resulting lists are bound to be a compromise.    Not only shall we haveto pay attention to United States views in the particular cases but the samewill also be true when we thereafter discuss the lists in the Paris Group.Other countries will have the same economic reasons as ourselves forwanting to reduce the extent of controls but may be interested in rather different items from the trade point of view.    Thus in those items wherethe strategic arguments for control are less important and the balance ofadvantage may lie in removing an item from the lists, different countries may reach different conclusions.    Nevertheless, provided that we can pushthe United States Government a substantial way in the direction of greater freedom, I would expect that the result of discussions in the Paris Grtncpwould be favourable.7. If my colleagues agree with this line of approach, I am advised that there would be no difficulty in producing a first list of suggested itemsfor removal, which could serve as a test of American views.    If theAmerican reaction is reasonably satisfactory the way will be clear for making proposals in the Paris Group for the necessary changes in the lists.    In order to persuade the United States Government that we are determined to secure some substantial reduction in the lists, we would makeit clear to them that:(a) we have not necessarily given up the &quot;short list&quot;proposal completely but will hold it in suspensein order to see what result is produced by thealternative line of approach;(b) we cannot undertake indefinitely to delay making proposals for shortening the list in the paris group;  if, therefore, as we believe, theUnited States Government attaches importanceto Anglo/American agreement on this question,it behoves the Americans to consider our proposal sympathetically, and,(c) until we are convinced that it is going to bepossible to make some substantial reduction inthe lists the political difficulty of institutingtransaction controls in the United Kingdom(to which we have agreed in principle as part ofan international co-operative effort to improve the effectiveness of the control system) willbe likely to remain.
A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.I. ,15TH JANUARY, 1954.8 . I recommend that:(a) we should inform the United States Government that, in deference to their views, we agree to hold the &quot;short list&quot; proposal insuspense while we consider, first with them and then in the Paris Group,the possibility of achieving a substantial shortening in the control lists bylooking at particular cases and removing the less important strategicitems;(b) in order to test the possibility of securing a substantial reduction in the lists, we should then put forward a first batch of items tobe removed from the lists, either because the controls over them are outof date or ineffective or do not have enough effect strategically to warrant the impediment to trade which they cause.   If, as the discussions develop,questions arise about the elimination of further items on which departments are not agreed, then Ministers should be consulted as necessary;(c) a final decision to introduce transaction controls, aspart of a co-operative effort to make the control system more effective,should be deferred until it is possible to judge whether this line of approach is likely to produce an adequate result.
