G4-secret cabinet OPFinsr   .&quot; &quot; i- w w 1 i w vj) j-&apos; f16TH JANUARY, 1954c-(54* 19 RECORD t;tiPY &quot;copy no&apos;1 ok/1CABINETEAST/WEST trade memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Prime Minister has drawn attention in recent cabinet discussions to the importance of expanding East/West trade.    Mr. Stassenhas proposed the same policy in the United States of America.    This tradecan be expanded, but only after some difficult decisions on policy have beentaken.    These decisions must be taken in the first instance by her Majesty&apos;s Government.2, I have studied the paper by the Foreign Secretary (C. (54) 18)and appreciate the difficulties he sees in going on with the &quot;short list&quot;proposal.    I am, however, very doubtful whether his proposals, even if accepted by the Americans, would lead to a real increase in trade.3. If we are going to make an attempt to expand East/West trade we should try and take a large step forward and not a small one.    In thelong run, small steps are just as likely to cause hard feelings in America,without bringing any corresponding commercial advantage to ourselves.4. The first thing is to be quite clear what it is we are trying todo.    I consider that we ought to be trying to secure the maximum of tradeconsistent with essential security needs.    Instead of this, we have been trying to prevent Russia having access to anything which might build upthe strength of her economy and, through that, her war potential.    There isvery little evidence that we have succeeded in this latter aim but in theprocess we have drawn up a massive array of embargoes, quantitative restrictions and provisions for international consultation which not onlyform an effective barrier to trade in the goods so restricted but also inpractice hamper any real expansion of exports of other goods too,5. I am quite clear that there is very little hope of achieving our aim of maximum trade consistent with essential security needs simply bytinkering with the existing lists.    What we need to do is to abandon theidea of a blockade designed to hurt the Russian economy, and insteadagree among ourselves a &quot;short list&quot; of items which clearly are of directmilitary importance.   I attach the list which I would regard as acceptablefrom a commercial point of view.    We have been pressed in inter-departmental discussions to include a wide range of such major productsas electric power equipment and electronic equipment.   Some electronicsshould certainly be included as being military equipment or containingunique know-how (and would be included in the &quot;short list&quot; I propose).But we must not embargo items like electric generators, or, in theelectronic field, ordinary television equipment and other products which
are already being commercially exploited.    To do so would be to defeat the objects which we have in view.6. I might summarise the effect of my proposal as being toreduce the embargo list to less than one half of its present size and to eliminate altogether the lists of goods which are kept under quantitativecontrol or under observation.   In particular we should drop our unilateralcontrol of natural rubber.7, It is idle to suppose that we can secure any real advantage toour trade by negotiating with the Americans for the removal of particular items from the existing lists.    As an illustration of the difficulties of apiecemeal approach,  of the 37 items which Production Departmentssuggested should be removed from quantitative restriction betweenAugust-December 1953, approximately one half were rejected on foreignpolicy or defence grounds within Whitehall, and of the half that went forward for consideration in Paris a further half was knocked out by the Americans.I am not complaining about the action of Departments here.    It was consistent with the policy we have hitherto pursued.    What we need to donow is to change it.8. Having agreed a short list between Ministers, we should tell the Americans, preferably at Ministerial level, that we agree withMr, Stassen that East/West trade must be increased.    We should say that -the policy described above is clearly the right way to set about it.    Weshould show them our,fshort list&apos;,&apos; and say that we have it in mind to put it before the other members of the Paris Group, and that we hope we shall ihave American support. If they object, we must look at the question again jin Cabinet in the light of their objections,9. If, and only if, we can get substantially the list proposed, should we express our willingness to go forward with the introduction of trans-action controls designed to ensure that we do all we can to prevent the verynarrow list of items of real military importance from reaching theRussians.10. I see the difficulties in disclosing our full intentions in replyto Questions in the House.    We must, however, go at least as far as mr. Stassen in his recent statement.    I therefore propose that we should say!that we believe an expansion of East/West trade to be desirable, that it is our policy to increase this trade to the maximum consistent with our essential security needs, and that to this end we are engaged in examiningwith the other Governments concerned the existing strategic controls.11. The proposals in this paper relate to the Soviet bloc and exclude China,    They may, however, set the pattern for China if and whenit becomes appropriate to reconsider our trade policy towards that country.12, I summarise my recommendations as follows;-(i)  That we should start off by agreeing the attached&quot;short list&quot; among ourselves.    We have not so faragreed any list and until we have, we are unlikely to get others to agree with us.
(ii) We should show the list we have agreed to the americans and do our best to get them toaccept it.    In the long run it will be no more unpopular than trying to get them topare down the existing controls by instalments.We should say that, provided we can get aa really &quot;short list&quot; as described, we will introduce transaction controls but that we donot think it possible to stop the various leaksin a system as cumbrous as the existing one,(iii) I suggest that these issues are of such major importance that they should be put to the americans at Ministerial level.    I understandthat Mr. Stassen would be ready to come here for a discussion with Ministers on these topics.(iv)  The next step must depend on the sort of answer we get from the Americans.    In the long run, it is unlikely that we shall get anything more than anunwilling acquiescence in our proposals.    If,however, the Americans press us not to raise thequestion of a &quot;short list&quot; in Paris I think theCabinet should look at the problem again.   I am quite clear that we should not at this stagecompromise with the Americans on anythingless satisfactory to our trade than the attached&quot;short list&quot;,(v) We should be prepared to answer Questions inthe House on the lines indicated in paragraph 10above.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.1. ,15TH JANUARY, 1954.-3
