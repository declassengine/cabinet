Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1963C. (63) 128 Copy No.    6 218th July, 1963CABINETTHE AIRCRAFT CARRIER programme memorandum by the Minister of defence decision has been pending since the end of 1960 and is now urgently required on the building of one aircraft carrier. Design work was authorised in January 1962and has now reached a stage at which we must either carry this work forward to production or keep the design team employed doing virtually no work or pay themoff. This situation is as well known in the House of Commons as it is in theRoyal Navy.2. The case for and against carriers has been exhaustively argued over theyears. It is analysed at Annex. When the last word has been said upon the matter,the carrier remains, for us as for the United States, the most flexible weapon forany type of conventional war. It provides both the eyes and the teeth of theRoyal Navy, and it is not possible to conceive of any realistic strategy which coulddispense with the use of carriers. A Navy without carriers would not be viable,but would probably cost at least as much as the Navy at present planned.3. Two carriers come to the end of their useful life in the early 1970s H.M.S. Victorious and H.M.S. Ark Royal. The decision asked for is to replaceonly one, leaving a decision on any other replacement open for consideration intwo years&apos; time.4. In addition, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force have agreed uponthe principle of a common aircraft for operation either from carriers or from land.The characteristics of this aircraft, based upon the Hawker P-l 154, have been agreed,and work in this field is now concentrated upon a feasibility study of this commonaircraft. It is my intention that a common aircraft shall be adopted by both theRoyal Navy and the Royal Air Force. Substantial savings in Research andDevelopment and production of the order of some  150 million over the next decade will flow from this principle of common use between the two Services.5. Failure to make known our intentions in these matters before the autumnwill ensure that we get the least political advantage from them; erroneous rumours of our intentions, which we are unable to correct, will continue to appear in thePress; pressure will mount against us in the House of Commons. If, on the otherhand, we announce decisions, we shall maintain the initiative in defence policy.If we can keep both the reorganisation of the central machinery for defence andthe making of the necessary decisions on a carrier and a common aircraft in the forefront of our policy, we shall be in an exceptionally strong position. I ask for decisions accordingly.P. T.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,17th July, 1963.2829
AnnexidAIRCRAFT CARRIER REPLACEMENTSeaborne Fixed-wing AircraftFixed-wing aircraft are indispensable to the Navy for the performance of itsmajor roles: effective world-wide deterrence to limited aggression, the control of amilitary situation at sea, including the defence of merchant shipping and of seaborneforces, and the support from the sea of our land and air forces ashore. Detailedstudies have recently been made of the possibility, for the 1970s and after, offashioning a next-generation Navy without orthodox aircraft carriers. These showed that a limited measure of close air support for forces ashore could, subject to certainserious military drawbacks, be provided from a smaller and less sophisticated classof ship. But this, while very far from cheap, would not dispense with the need for aircraft carriers for the Nayys other roles. Moreover, the advent of the surface-to-surface guided missile has accentuated the importance of the fixed-wing aircraft in the strike role. These seaborne aircraft must be operated, maintained, re-armed and re-fuelled in ships; and for this there is no practicable alternative to the aircraft carrier.An &quot; All-missile Navy &quot;2. A policy of abandoning carrier replacement now and switching overcompletely to long-range guided missiles would involve a gap of a decade or morebetween the demise of the Fleet Air Arm and the equipping of the Fleet in the late1970s with the new weapons and the big guided missile ships to carry them. during that gap the Navy would be virtually without eyes or teeth, and largely defencelessagainst even a second-class Navy armed with guided missiles. Even after the gap,the Navy, without fixed-wing aircraft, v/ould remain highly vulnerable and unequalto the roles required of it. An &quot; all-missile Navy &quot;, taking into account the estimatedResearch and Development costs of the new long-range guided missiles wouldprobably turn out at least as expensive over the next 15 years as the Navy at present planned.Mobile Air Bases3. It is important to think of aircraft carriers not in a purely maritime settingor in the context of specified &quot; roles of the Navy &quot; but more broadly, as a means fordeploying tactical air power wherever in the world we may wish, independently or as part of an allied force. They alone give the maximum flexibility for deployment of military power; they can be positioned and held poised unobtrusively or with themaximum political impact, as the situation may require. The political and militarybackground in the 1970s can only be guessed at but two things seem very probable:our oversea footholds ashore will go on diminishing in number, and the Russianswill continue with the present significant spread of their maritime power aboutthe world, directly or through satellite navies. The uncertainty of our tenure of bases and the general unpredictability of the politico-military situations with whichwe may be faced and even of the areas with which we may become principally concerned, all make it highly desirable to have the mobile, self-contained air baseswhich only aircraft carriers can provide.
