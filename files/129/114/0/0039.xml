ccfBC-r * 1 1 secret 1 /y(THIS D^UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (63) 13924th July, 1963CABINETFUTURE DEFENCE POLICY^THE AIR GRAFT CARRIER ^programme memorandum, by the Secretary of State  or air the Minister of Defence asks for an immediate decision onthe replacement of one aircraft carrier, to be coupled with anannouncement of a feasibility study for a joint R.N. /R.A.F, aircraft.I welcome the feasibility study but I believe that we should approachwith great caution the proposal to decide now on what will in effectbe a carrier replacement programme.    My reasons are as follows(a) according to the Admiralty&apos;s costings a new carrier isnot due to serve an operational commission until1972-73 and the order to build one is not needed until1965-66;the feasibility study for the joint aircraft will not beready until the end of September and an examinationof the operational implications of the joint aircraft has not yet been started;(c) an immediate announcement that we propose to build a new aircraft carrier is not necessarily politicallyadvantageous, unless we can satisfy our critics thatit fulfils cost/effectiveness criteria;(d) the Defence Budget is under strain and for 1964-65serious cuts are already being examined and manywill have to be executed.    To embark upon a newgeneration of carriers will place existing and perhapsmore desirable military programmes under unbearablestress;(e) I do not dispute that in the 1970s aircraft carriers will beof military use.    But the heart of defence policy mustbe to select the military capabilities which will be most effective in meeting our defence commitments and to cut out those which give a lesser return.    We cannotgo on trying to squeeze a little of everything into thedefence programme;(f) there has never been a thorough analysis of the carrierissue including a cost/effectiveness study.    An air defence study covering, inter alia, how best to defend the fleet is only just starting;COPY NO.(b)
(g) finally, I cannot find some of the arguments advanced in favour of carriers entirely convincing.    For instance,the final picture drav/n by the Minister of Defence ofthe self-contained carrier in an almost baseless worldomits the basic detail that these ships need facilities(including airfields) overseas to carry out self-maintenance and to practise their aircrews.2.   For these main reasons I urge that the carrier programme should be thoroughly and objectively scrutinised before a decision is taken.    A few months delay cannot be militarily vital.Politically, a decision to have a cost/effectiveness study would generally be recognised as one of the first fruits of the defencereorganisation.    The Government should take credit for this action and couple it with an announcement about a feasibility studyfor the joint aircraft.H.F.Air Ministry, W. G. 1.24th July, 1963
