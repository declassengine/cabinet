16$, July, 1963CABINETMAI, T A JNDEPE ND ENC E.Memorandum^^^and Seer etay y.,   j?.t.g-t,e pr th^Cojgnies^Independence ConfereiiceIn August, .1962 the Government of Malta formally asked for independence.    In December, I had preliminary talks in London with the maltese Prime Minister, Dr. Borg Olivier, at which it was agreed thatan Independence Conference should be held in 1963, to which representa-tives of all Parties in the Legislature would be invited.2.     This Conference is due to take place in the second half of July.Its work will be mainly confined to approval of a revised constitution foran independent Malta,    This should not present great difficulties, though there are certain issues on which there will be disagreement.     these include -(a) the retention of the official status of the roman catholic religion with its consequential effectsupon certain aspects of the lav/ (e. g. divorce);(b) membership of the Commonwealth;  and(c) the Monarchy.3.     I have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of the population are in favour of (a) and (b).    No doubt the same also applies to thequestion of the Monarchy.    Eut I do not think it would be right to adviseHer Majesty to remain Queen of Malta after independence, unless we aresatisfied that the Crown is not going to be made a party political issue at each election.4, Provided these matters can be satisfactorily resolved, I proposeto fix a date for Malta&apos;s independence towards the end of this year.5. Outside the ambit of the Conference there will be two main issues to settle -(a) the retention of the British Forces on the island; and(b) financial aid.-1-COPY NO.       *(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
Defence Agreement6,     Although our military facilities in Malta are no longer indispens-able, some are important and others would be expensive to replace else-where.    Dr. Olivier is ready to conclude a defence agreement whichwould provide -(a) that Britain would have the right to maintainarmed forces in Maltaj  and(b) that military facilities would not be accorded to any other nation, except with Britain&apos;s consent.7.     To ensure its validity, this agreement would not actually be signed until after independence,,    In order to make it more difficult forany future Maltese Government to repudiate it, it may be decided tohold a referendum before signature.    If this were done, a largefavourable majority is certain.8.     In addition, the present Government is anxious to establish somecontinuing link between Malta and NATO, which at present has a navalheadquarters in Valetta.    This matter is at present being explored.9.     The Minister of Defence is in agreement with the proposals inthe preceding paragraphs.Financial Aid10,    Malta, with a population of 330, 000, is smaller than any existingCommonwealth country.    Apart from the activities which have grown uparound the British Naval Ease and garrison, Malta has few industries.There is a high level of unemployment, which has been considerablyaggravated by the run-down of our forces.11. Since the new management took over from Eailey&apos;s, work in the dockyard has been increasing. With our help, a number of small lightengineering and other indiistries have been set up on the island and willprovide an appreciable number of jobs. Everything possible is also being done to help Malta build up a successful tourist business. among other projects, we are providing finance for a new Hilton hotel.12.    At the same time we have been taking steps to stimulateemigration to Australia and Europe, including Britain.    The overalltarget to which we are working is about 10,000 emigrants a year.13.     But despite all these efforts, it will clearly be necessary for britain to go on helping Malta financially for a number of years.   Thisis at present being discussed with the Treasury but, as I explained above, this is not a matter which will be on the agenda of the Conference.-2-
Recgmm endatipn sl-So    I accordingly ask the Cabinet to agree -(a) that, provided the new constitution can be satisfactorilysettled at the forthcoming Conference, Malta shouldbe granted independence about the end of this year?(b) that an assurance should be given (in general terms tobe agreed with the Treasury) that Britain will continueto provide financial assistance to Malta after independence; and(c) that a defence agreement for the maintenance ofBritish Forces in Ivlalta should be negotiated witha view to signature immediately after independence.D.S.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.1st July, 1963.
