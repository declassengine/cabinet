QdMLlM,. COPY NO. jSjf10th July, 1963CABINETFEILDEN REPORT ON ENGINEERING DESIGN&amp;!  S^2 ^S [3SL!feSL^S.JxSlKSL T^ e iderxt-o mtiie .Counjcil-and Minister^forScienceWhilst my reasons for objecting to any interference with thisreport are as stated in the Chancellor of the Exchequers paper(C. (63) 118), I cannot accept the view that the quotations from the reportreferred to in paragraph 3 of the Chancellor^ paper are either a fair orbalanced reading of the effect of the report.    In particular:-(i) paragraph 32, which is cited, begins with the words &quot;On theother hand some witnesses were critical ...&quot;     It isimmediately preceded by paragraph 31 (not cited) whichquoted the witnesses which were eulogistic.    The effectof paragraphs 31 and 32 is a balanced picture of mixedpraise and blame j(ii) paragraph 33, which is cited, is followed by paragraph 34(not cited).    Paragraph 34 quotes the contrary evidence which in the view of the Committee justified their con-clusion which either qualifies or rejects the criticalevidence quoted in paragraph 33.    The whole should be read in conjunction with the commendatory passages onthe aircraft and aero-engine industries in paragraphs 15and 16;(iii) paragraph 37, Sir Christopher Hinton&apos;s criticisms are tobe compared with his basically favourable evidence quoted in paragraph 31;(iv) paragraph 33 is in fact a paragraph recapitulating the viewsof the Service Departments that basically brilliant designscan be spoilt by want of attention to detail.    I am informed that this view has been publicly expressed atleast by the Air Ministry on many occasions;(v) in paragraphs 39 and 40, also cited, it should, be notedthat the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority&apos;views (of which paragraph 39 is a summary) refer ingeneral to the &quot;major successes achieved by criticalattention to details&quot; and paragraph 40 begins with thegeneral statement that the matters referred to were&quot;pinpointing&quot; individual weaknesses;-1-
(vi) one of the general conclusions of the Committee, as statedin paragraph 20, is that &quot;the present standing andreputation of British engineering design is generally good and in certain fields outstanding&quot;;(vii) the passages objected to were either summaries of orquotations from witnesses of great authority who, I am informed, in each case have approved of the particularuse and quotation from their evidence.2.     I very much regret that an unbalanced and inaccurate account ofthe effect of the report was made at the Economic Policy Committee byselecting excerpts cl the report out of context from a document whichin my opinion is a balanced review of the situation.HAILS HAMOffice of the Lord President of the Counciland Minister for Science,    S. W. 1.10th July, 1963.
