confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1963C. (63) 143 Copy No.    6330th July, 1963CABINETIMPORT POLICY FOR JUTE GOODSMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Present Position on protection the present arrangements for the protection of the Dundee jute industryinvolve State monopoly buying from India and Pakistan, under which some jutegoods are not imported at all and those that are imported are sold by the JuteControl on the bases set out in column 2 of the Annex to this paper. The case for changing these arrangements was considered by the Economic Policy Committee(E.A. (63) 25th Meeting) and hangs on three main points. The first is that it wouldbe right, particularly just before the Kennedy Round and the United nations conference, to meet the Indians1 urgent request for some move towards restoringtheir rights in the United Kingdom market. Secondly, that the current level ofprotection was working against the interests of merchants and users of jute as an industrial material. Thirdly, that the Government should cut the link (inherent inthe arrangements) with the industry&apos;s pricing system which was condemned by the restrictive Practices Court. The Committee accepted that there was a strong case for an early change in the control of imported jute goods. The Committee recognisedthat, on political grounds, there were doubts about the timing; but I was authorisedto put proposals for changing the system to the jute industry provided that theSecretary of State for Scotland, who was not present, assented.Discussions with the industry. With the agreement of the Secretary of State, the Minister of State hasheld two meetings with the industry. At the first meeting on the 9th July, the industryclaimed that the new proposals would expose the bulk of their production toexcessive Asian competition and that they would cause a serious lack of confidence and a substantial rise in unemployment in Dundee. Since a violent reaction fromthe industry to any change in its present favoured position was to be expected,room for manoeuvre had been allowed for and, at a second meeting with theemployers, unions and civic authorities in Dundee on the 18th July, revised proposals were made by the Minister of State. This second meeting was authorisedafter I had reported to the Economic Policy Committee (E.A. (63) 31st Meeting).3. At this meeting, although the industry maintained its opposition in principle to any change in the present state of affairs, it was the Minister of Stated strongimpression, subsequently confirmed by hearsay, that the fears aroused by theearlier proposals had been substantially allayed and that there was little heatbehind the protests. The details of the revised proposals can best be gathered fromcolumn 6 of the Annex to this paper.Timing of a Change4. None of my colleagues dissent from the proposition that the presentsystem of protection and the machinery of Government buying which it involvesshould be replaced in favour of the kind of proposals which I have put forward.The only question is whether a start should be made now. The reasons for going ahead can be summarised as follows:(a) The industry have, first in connection with the negotiations with theEuropean Economic Community and now in their discussions withthe Minister of State, been brought to the brink of change. It will be2906
CONFIDENTIALvery much harder, if indeed it is possible at all, to start again at some future time if we retreat now. The industry will always find some good reason for delaying action., (b) This is the right time to make a move in the Indians&apos; direction (especially if we may later have to be difficult with them over cotton).These reasons, strong as they are, might be outweighed if the consequences ofaction would be really serious unemployment. But the revised proposals provide,for a year at least, roughly the current level of protection for those goods whichform the vast bulk of Dundee&apos;s protection. Even at the end of three years these goods will still be enjoying an effective 40 per cent disguised tariff, plus thepossibility of tackling any &quot; rigging &quot; by the Asians of the price of raw jute.The Proposal for an Enquiry5. The industry have pressed for a formal enquiry to be held before anychange is made in the present arrangements, and have stated their willingness toput forward constructive suggestions. I should certainly be ready to hold such an enquiry; but the long history of negotiations with the jute industry does not makeme optimistic about its outcome and I should strongly deprecate its use as adelaying tactic. I fear this would be inevitable if the industry knew that no action would be taken as long as the enquiry was going on. There will be a year of virtualstandstill under my proposals which should provide time enough for an enquiry toproduce its conclusions and even for a modification of our intentions in the event-which I must regard as improbable of the emergence of valid reasons for modification. Even if the enquiry takes longer than a year, there will only be a5 per cent reduction in protection.conclusion. I therefore seek the agreement of my colleagues to the conclusion of thenegotiations with the industry on the basis of the terms put to them on 18th Julywith such minor modifications as may appear desirable for presentational or technical reasons. The question of the enquiry and its terms of reference can besettled at the same time with the industry.F. J. E.Board of Trade, S.W.1,29 th July, 1963.
