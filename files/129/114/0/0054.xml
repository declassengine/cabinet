CABINETTHE BERLINER ENSEMBLEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe refusal to allow two members of the Berliner Ensemble to attend theEdinburgh Festival Drama Conference at the beginning of September has caused a lot of publicity, mostly unfavourable. I attach a paper setting out the facts andbackground of the case. It is a difficult question on which I should value the viewsof my colleagues.H.Foreign Office, S.W.1,13th September, 1963.3157Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1963C.

annex the BERLINER ENSEMBLEBackgroundEast Germans who wish to travel to North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(NATO) countries are a special case. They cannot travel on East German passportssince NATO countries do not recognise the East German regime and thereforerefuse to recognise an East German passport as an acceptable travel document.In view of our responsibilities for Germany as a whole, the United States, Franceand ourselves run an Allied Travel Office in West Berlin which issues East Germanson application with Temporary Travel Documents in lieu of East German passports.Visas can be endorsed in these travel documents in the normal way. Before thebuilding of the Berlin Wall in August 1961 the Allied Travel Office enabled about20,000 East Germans in this way to travel to NATO countries each year.2. The building of the Berlin Wall produced a strong feeling in the Alliancethat a visible and immediate Western reaction was needed. The West germans in particular pressed for this. We resisted the wilder demands for economic sanctions, etc., and agreement was eventually reached between the United States,France and ourselves to refuse Temporary Travel Documents to all East Germansother than those who wished to travel for genuinely private or trade purposes.This decision was endorsed by our other NATO Allies and the restrictions thereforebecame agreed NATO policy. The aim was, and is, to bring pressure on the EastGermans to modify their ban on freedom of movement (particularly the prohibitionof West Berliners visiting East Berlin), and to protest against the unilateralabrogation of Four-Power Agreements and East German pretensions that the wall represented a State frontier. The restrictions were also designed to preventthe East German authorities from reaping political dividends from visits by individuals and groups of artists, sportsmen, scientists, etc., whom they choseto allow out! Similar but less severe restrictions imposed between September 1960and early 1961 had contributed to persuading the East German authorities tomodify controls they then imposed on West German access to East Berlin.Berliner Ensemble3. The much publicised recent case concerned two members of the BerlinerEnsemble who wished to accompany Helena Weigel (the Austrian widow ofBertolt Brecht) to the Edinburgh Festival Drama Conference in early September.No applications were received from them either for Temporary Travel Documentsor for visas, but Mr. Kenneth Tynan, the Chairman of the Drama Conference,who made enquiries of the Home Office on their behalf, was informed that theywould not be able to attend the conference some weeks in advance of its opening.I subsequently told Lord Harewood the same thing when he appealed on their behalf.Developments since 19614. The restrictions have certainly damaged the standing of the East Germanregime by drawing attention to the barbarity of the Wall. But there are signs thatthe restrictions are also threatening Western interests. Not only have they exposedsome Western Governments, particularly our own, to strong criticism fromnumerous sectors of the public but Communist countries have engineered attempts to transfer a number of international scientific and sports meetings to neutralor Communist venues because Western hosts could not guarantee that representatives from all countries would be allowed to participate. There is no evidence that these attempts have yet been successful in any case but the royal society and the Parliamentary Sports Committee were sufficiently worried by theoutlook to send deputations to see me last March and urge a relaxation of NATOpolicy.5. In April this year I therefore instructed the Embassy in Washington todiscuss with the United States the possibility of persuading NATO to relax therestrictions so as to admit internationally known East German scientists, artistsand athletes to attend international occasions in NATO countries.
6. As a result of discussions we had with the United States, France andGermany a paper was submitted and approved by the North Atlantic council which provided for a trial relaxation in the scientific and sporting fields. Inconsequence travel facilities can now be granted to East Germany scientists andsportsmen who wish to take part in international scientific and sports meetingsas members of an all-German delegation or team. This does not go as far as weshould have been ready to do. It only admits East Germans under &quot; all-German &quot;cover and does not extend to artists who cannot easily be brought under thiskind of cover. But, in view of the United States, French and West german attitude, it is as much as the traffic will bear at present. It is still too early to judgehow successful this limited relaxation will be. The East Germans do not likeallowing their people to join all-German delegations. But they have allowed onescientist to visit the United States on these terms, and they may accept the system by degrees. Lord Dundee announced these relaxations in the House of lords on 18th July.7. The present position as it affects visits by East Germans to this countryis as follows: East Germans are allowed to come here on private visits to friendsor relatives and for compassionate reasons; and for trade purposes. They wouldalso be allowed to attend international scientific and sports meetings, provided they are members of an all-German delegation or team, but no case has yet arisen in the United Kingdom. Applications for travel facilities from all other EastGermans are refused.8. We are being criticised at present for allowing business visits but notcultural visits. The best defence is to say that cultural visits can be exploited toraise East German prestige but that business visits cannot. Another criticism isthat the West Germans do not impose similar restrictions on East German artists,etc., who can get permission to visit the Federal Republic. This is true, but it is acardinal point of West German policy that travel within the two Germanies is notto be equated with foreign travel. NATO has always accepted this, and we, theUnited States and France are committed in principle to facilitating freedom of movement for Germans within Germany. The Allied Travel Office in West Berlindoes not deal with permits for travel within Germany.9. The restrictions are reviewed in NATO at frequent intervals. We shall continue to press for a gradual relaxation in the policy when we see a chance, butthis will be a long and difficult process. Our major allies, and in particular theGermans, are at present in favour of retaining the existing restrictions. Scope forunilateral action on our part is limited since the Allied Travel Office is run bythe United States and France as well as ourselves and Temporary Travel Documentscan only be issued by tripartite agreement. We could only admit East germans in the NATO-prohibited categories by issuing them with visas on affidavits. Thiswould violate our undertakings in NATO and provoke strong United States andGerman objections.
