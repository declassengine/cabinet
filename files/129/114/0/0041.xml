1 orJt i.J \)Endurance of Carriers, and Shore Facilities Needed4. (a) Given adequate afloat support, a carrier task group can operate for periods up to two or th-ee months without any resort to shore facilities. With twocarriers in the group, the capability for active operations can be sustained throughoutthat period. In the last war, carriers of the United Kingdom Pacific Fleet, althoughnever required to achieve their full potential of 90 days&apos; endurance, operated for two months without any access to a main base.(b) It would be perfectly feasible to operate carriers East of Suez with no basefacilities other than in Australia, and with the use of anchorages for self-maintenance.(c) The principal base facility required in Australia would be the use of an airfield with storage and support facilities. For major repairs, the aircraft would either go to the Australian aircraft industry or be shipped back to the UnitedKingdom as at present. The logistic requirements afloat would not demandsignificantly more afloat support ships than already planned in the Long-termCostings.id) The United States 6th Fleet operates in the Mediterranean with no fixedbase facilities other than an airfield. The carriers are rotated back to America on a six-month cycle; and but for the limiting factors of American notions on familyseparation, this period could easily be doubled. Our own sailors already do oneyear &quot; separated &quot;.Nuclear Propulsion5. It was asked whether nuclear propulsion was being or ought to becontemplated for the new carrier. It is accepted that this would offer operationalbenefits, especially of speed, availability and a reduced requirement for refuelling at sea (the aircraft would of course still require refuelling). The objections are three:(a) Our knowledge of the use of nuclear propulsion in surface vessels is limitedat present to what we can learn from the United States. It would be most unwise to take our first venture into this experimental field with a ship of such vital importance to our defence strategy.(b) The cost of research and development and the construction of a shoreprototype would be of the order of  20 million, and the ship herselfwould cost some  18 million more.(c) Some two to three years of unacceptable delay would be required forredesign work.SECRET.............mi i.......i..................................&quot; .......... . n    ^wiiTiniiiiiTiiiiifiiiiiiwitiiiiiiiiii^iiiwiiiiiiiiMiJiiiiinstandard is more exacting than in any other class of ship: training and operation in peacetime involve the same danger to life as in wartime.ib) As a ship gets older, the cost of maintaining her in efficient service becomesuneconomical. Later it becomes physically impossible to keep heroperational, no matter how much is spent.(c) H.M.S. Victorious was completed in 1941 and will be 30 years old by the planned date of her replacement. This is longer than is normally allowed;it was only made possible by a long modernisation. (She will have hadabout the same life as the Queen Mary, which has only to steam aboutthe Atlantic at constant speed.)id) The Ark Royal&apos;s hull and machinery were completed in 1943-44. She has never been modernised and it would certainly not be an economicproposition now.(e) 1971 and 1972 were selected as the end-of-life dates for these two ships bythe considered judgment of the Admiralty technical departments. It was indeed accepted that one or both of these ships might have to be taken out of service even before these dates, if only because of the hazard tothe lives of aircrew.
Financial Savings on the 1963 Long-term Costings6. The programme which is now proposed would show savings of some  285million on the Defence Budget as a whole over the costing period:  millionCommon aircraft and rationalisation* East of Suez:Research and development   ......      .........       iriProduction .........      ............      1Z*Detection of three new construction aircraft carriers, offset byextra spending to keep Hermes and Eagle \n service......      132285Note. It would remain necessary for operational reasons to have three carrierair groups, but the strike/fighter element in each group would be reduced in size by about one-third.Vulnerability7. (a) All experience has shown that an aircraft carrier in a balanced taskforce is an extremely difficult target to disable. Of the total of 198 R.N. and U.S.N.carriers employed in active operations in the 1939-45 War, only 19 were sunk. a proportion of these losses were of carriers not operating within a Task Force. Thesesinkings were in a major war, of many years&apos; duration, against major Powersemploying the most sophisticated weapons then available and endowed with considerable maritime experience. The loss of the Prince of Wales and Repulseis sometimes quoted as a classic example of the vulnerability of warships to air attack. It was in fact a classic example of what happens to warships when no fixed-wing air defence is available.lb) During active operations a carrier forms the nucleus of a Task Force,which is itself a part of the larger complex of all the forces involved in theparticular operation. The carrier both contributes to the defence of the Task Forceand derives protection from it. As the most valuable single unit, the carrier is normally disposed and manoeuvred so that it is the best protected.(c) Even the problem of identifying the carrier within the Task Force, in anera of advanced electronic counter-measures, can be made extremely difficult forthe enemy. Indeed he may well be forced to expose himself to the very sophisticateddefences of the Task Force by resorting to visual identification.trf) A panel of scientists headed by the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministerof Defence accepted the carriers survivability in the sort of operations in which itwould be used. Field-Marshal Festing (formerly Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff), too. gave an independent view in a paper on future air strike policy in limitedwar outside Europe. He was speaking about intervention operations but his remarksare equally applicable to the carriers other roles:&quot;... it is common ground that in limited war we shall need a sea-lift capability,which means that all the ships in the group while at sea will in any case bevulnerable. The presence of the carrier provides defence and thus reduces the vulnerability of the amphibious group. This simply means that they must be defended and the risks accepted.&quot;Reprovision if Carriers were Abandoned8. Two studies have been carried out into the possibility of defending ships at sea and providing support for assault operations otherwise than by means of aircraft carriers:la) The first study was based on broad staff requirements for an &quot;off-shoresupport ship &quot; for use by aircraft which would normally be shore based.The staff requirements were worked out with the absolute minimum of&quot; sophistication &quot;. The conclusion was that the only practicable solutionlay in a specially built new construction ship displacing about 20,000-22,000 tons and costing  17- 20 million and that a minimum of threesuch ships would be needed. There are a number of drawbacks to thisconcept:  perhaps particularly the extreme vulnerability of this sort
of ship and the technical difficulties of operating complex modernaircraft in a limited war setting with only first line maintenance facilities.But in any event the off-shore support ship with its limited role canonly be evaluated in the context of the wider question, how, if at all,the Navy could be refashioned without aircraft carriers so as to meet its roles other than the provision of air support for the Army. This wasthe subject of the second study.(b) In our view there can be no doubt that unless we were contemplating the virtual dissolution of the Navy, abandonment of aircraft carrierreplacement would &quot;have to be accompanied by a switch over to thedevelopment of long-range surface-to-air and surface-to-surface guided missiles, and of the big guided missile ships to take them. A Navywithout carriers or long-range S.A.G.W. and S.S.G.W. would be helplessagainst even such a navy as that of Indonesia.(c) Such a switch-over would (i) leave the Fleet unequal to its major roles, since there are certainindispensable tasks which missiles could not take over fromseaborne fixed-wing aircraft: tactical reconnaissance,surveillance, probe and identification, and the destruction of enemy shadowers and jamming aircraft;(ii) arrive some 10 years too late, since long-range S.A.G.W. andS.S.G.W. could not be developed and fitted in the Fleet beforethe late 1970s;(iii) cost at least as much, including research and development, overthe next 15 years as the Navy at present planned.The Need for a Decision9. The question of carrier replacement has been far more exhaustivelyexamined over the past three years than any other aspect of our defence programmes. It has been the subject of several presentations by the Admiralty, a major costing exercise by Admiralty/Defence/Treasury, a thorough examination by the Chiefs of Staff, an impartial study by the Chief Scientific Adviser&apos;s panel of scientists, and discussions by Ministers in the Defence Committee. We do notbelieve that any new evidence can be expected and we do not see that further delayscan serve any useful purpose. On the other hand the Minister of Defence has already explained the advantages which he considers will accrue from taking and announcinga decision now.Conclusion10. It should be stressed again that the Cabinet are not now being asked toconsider a &quot; carrier replacement programme &quot;. The proposal is that we should decide now, and announce our decision, to build this one ship.P. T.C.Ministry of Defence, S.W. I.26th July, 1963.
