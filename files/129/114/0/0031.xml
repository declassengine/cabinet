(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S government. (63) 131COPY NO.60CABINETPEERAGE BILL.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster.      Sub-section 7(2) of the Peerage Bill provides that it shall come into operation on the dissolution of this Parliament.    TheOpposition in the House of Commons moved to omit this sub-section on 27th June and on a Division on strict Party lines the Governmentwon by 174 to 113.     Yesterday in the House of Lords, with many whonormally support the Government voting against us, a Motion wascarried deleting this sub-section which would have the effect of bringing the Bill in on Royal Assent.   The Joint Select committee made no recommendation on this point and so it is not part of what has been commonly referred to as the &quot;package deal1&apos;.2.      Nevertheless the provision that the Bill should operate fromdissolution has been our intention from the beginning and has beenreaffirmed on more than one occasion by Cabinet,    There are reallyno new arguments to be adduced and the precedents such as they are on the whole favour bringing in such a change on dissolution.    Thereare two consequences of bringing the Bill in on Royal Assent:(a) Any Member of the House of Commons who succeeded to apeerage between Royal Assent and the date of dissolution could if he wished continue in his present seat.    If the Bill came in on dissolutionand a Member of the present House succeeded to a title some months before dissolution this might not be possible.    Nevertheless this isan unlikely contingency, and although I explained this point carefullyto the House of Commons Lord Lambton (who, because of the age ofhis father, might be the most likely person to be affected by thisprovision) voted with the Government.(b) The real point is that the Government would have to fight orconcede an election in Bristol South-East to Mr. Wedgwood Benn.    Thesitting Member, Mr. Malcolm St. Clair, has given specific pledgesthat he would resign if Mr. Eenn&apos;s position was altered by Parliament.This in effect would make the Bill from the point of view of theGovernments supporters in the House of Commons a Wedgwood BennEnabling Bill.3.      The difficulty is that from the beginning we have told our supporters in the House of Commons that this is the one thing we wouldnot allow to happen.     It is really because of this that the other provisions are in the Bill at all.    The Cabinet of the day v/as not really concerned with the rights of those Scottish representativePeers who do not get themselves elected to Parliament or the case for hereditary Peeresses in their own right.    We inserted thesematters so that this Bill should not single out Mr. Wedgwood Benn.-1-
When a year ago I was invited to discuss this Bill with theGovernments supportei*s in Parliament it was this point whichthey pressed on me in very fierce terms.    Of course, it is opento any Peer to disclaim when this Bill becomes law but the onlyone that has said formally that he v/ill is Mr. Wedgwood Bennhimself.4.      We may have to take the Lords Amendments to the PeerageBill next week.    I am sorry that the urgency of the matter meanstha.t this paper has to be put round at very short notice andwithout the usual consultation.    In particular it is without prejudice to what the Governments supporters in Parliament will say attheir meeting tomorrow when the matter is certain to be raised,and also without prejudice to the views of members of the Cabinetin the House of Lords who may have anxieties about the effect ofa Commons reversal of their decision.    My instinctive reaction,confirmed by such brief conversations as I have been able to have,is that we should hold to the advice we have consistently given toour supporters and therefore try to reverse the decision taken inthe House of Lordsa    But I recognise that it may be neither possiblenor wise to do this.Office of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, S, W. 1.17th July, 1963.-2-
