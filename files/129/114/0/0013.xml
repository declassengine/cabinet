Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1963C. (63) 113 Copy No.2nd July, 1963CABINETTHE CHARGE FOR SCHOOL MEALSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i refer to the Minister of Education^ memorandum of 1st July (C. (63) 110)in which he proposes that from 30th September the charge for school meals shouldbe increased by 3d. to Is. 3d.2. While I agree in principle to an increase in the charge, I feel strongly thatan autumn increase would be unfortunately timed, especially for Scotland wherethe economy has been recovering more slowly than I had hoped and where theunemployment figures will begin to rise again in October from seasonal causes.Moreover, looking at the educational field alone, there has been and will continueto be very sharp reactions in Scotland against the limitations imposed on school building this year by a control on investment. Another factor is that the highercharge may seem to bear hardly on two classes:(a) Children of larger families (even although there is some reduction in costto these children); and(b) The increasing number of children in rural areas who will have to takemeals as a result of the steady closure of small local schools.3. A related proposal by the Minister of Education to introduce a standardscheme for the remission of charges to replace the varying schemes at presentoperated by local authorities has been referred by the Home Affairs Committeeto a sub-committee of Ministers. While in Scotland a centrally-imposed scheme would be accepted by many authorities, there would be sharp reactions from afew who operate a scheme more generous than the model advised by myDepartment. In particular this would concern Glasgow, the largest authority, where30 per cent (20,000) of the meals served are free compared with the national averageof 20 per cent.4. It is difficult to estimate the saving in Scotland involved by the increasedcharge but it would certainly be less than  1 million a year. The uptake of mealsin Scotland is already low at 36 per cent compared with England (56 per cent).The Scottish uptake has in the past proved very sensitive to an increase and a15 per cent drop is to be expected in the number taking meals (the uptake would fall to 31 per cent). It would take a year or two for the figures to recover andthe more or less fixed overheads would have to be spread over the reduced numberof meals.5. The last increase was in 1957 which was two years prior to an election.To take action now which directly affects a very high proportion of Scottishhouseholds without providing any counter attraction on the &quot; Modernisation of britain &quot; theme seems politically most unwise.M. A. C. N.Scottish Office, Whitehall, S.W.1,2nd July, 1963.2747
