(TH*document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.I.   INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUNDMy colleagues will remember that at the 1962 meeting o  theInternational Monetary Fund, I put forward certain proposals for setting up a Mutual Currency Account within the general framework of the Fund as a possible additional source of international liquiditywhich I was convinced would be needed as world trade grew and asthe United States moved from deficit towards surplus.    I was careful to make it p lain that I was not concerned with any immediate shortageof liquidity but with a likely shortage that would develop over the years.The underlying idea of the Mutual Currency Account was that, inreturn for helping weak currencies, creditor countries would acquire a new type of gold-guaranteed reserve asset.    I was not thinking interms of any large amounts, but the Mutual Currency Account could have provided a useful pilot experiment in the use of Fund paper.    I did not put forward the idea as a cut and dried plan, but i-ather as away of getting discussion of the problem moving on the right lines.2.     It was perhaps not surprising that my proposals did not atthe time get a very warm reception.    The United States were suspicious of the idea since they feared it might make creditor countries lesswilling to hold dollars and therefore undermine their elaborate systemof bilateral swaps and medium-term borrowing.    The Europeans were equally unenthusiastic, some of them regarding it simply as a deviceby which a United Kingdom deficit might be financed.3.     In the last six months, however, there have been signs that opinion both in the United States and in Europe has been changing.   Themain reason for this has probably been the growing realisation that theUnited States deficit is likely to continue on a large scale for a numberof years.    This presents the world with the problem of how to financea deficit of $2-3 billion a year without disrupting the international monetary system..Tjh.e-United States4.     Up to about last Easter, it is probable that the United states authorities thought that they had a good chance of financing theirdeficit by an extension of the bilateral arrangements which they startedmaking two years ago.     Thus, they spent the winter extending thenumber of swaps they had with other countries and arranging formedium-term borrowing from their European creditors.     They were inclined to argue that the longer-term problem of liquidity which wouldC.(63)16120th September, 1963CABINETBANK AND FUND MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON, 1963Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer-1
arise once the United States was in surplus could best be solved by a reversal of this process, namely, by the United States being willing tohold other countries&apos; currencies.    Since Easter, however, it became apparent that other measures to tackle the United States deficit were necessary.    President Kennedy announced certain measures in July,including a $500 million standby with the Fund.    hi his speech, thePresident showed himself aware of the need to tackle not only theproblem of the United States deficit, but of the longer-run problem of finding new sources of liquidity once the United States closed herpayments gap and hence ceased pushing out dollars into the rest of theworld,5.      We found in a series of detailed talks with the United states treasury and Federal Reserve Bank that the United States authorities were becoming increasingly aware that the United States might have todraw on the Fund and that - whether that became necessary or not -there was much to be said for strengthening the Fund and making it easier to use.    We reached agreement with them that the best approachat present for dealing with future liquidity needs was by way of getting the Fund to consider the case for a 50 per cent increase in quotas anda corresponding increase in the borrowing arrangements agreed in 1961.The Fund should also consider ways in which greater use could be madeof its facilities, both short-term and longer-term.    The United states authorities also showed themselves very ready to discuss ways and means by which the two reserve currencies could support each other,over and above present arrangements which include a $500 millionswap arrangement at the end of last May.Fur on e an Cre ditor Countr ie s6.      Opinion has been moving on the Continent, though not so quickly as in Washington.    It may be that with a continuing United Statesdeficit, some countries such as France and Germany would like to seethe United States draw on the Fund though, of course, this would mean that their own currencies would be drawn.    From their point of view,however, it might well be preferable that their lending to the UnitedStates should carry the Ftuid&apos;s gold guarantee rather than that theyshould add to their holdings of unguaranteed dollars.    In that event,they might not be averse to an increase in Fund quotas which wouldenable the United States to draw the large sums they are likely to need.Whether this is so or not, the discussions among the members of theGroup of Ten (the ten leading financial countries who signed the 1961Fund Borrowing Scheme designed to provide the Fund with additional resources) have led to a proposal, to be discussed at the international monetary Fund meeting this year, that there be a wide-ranging reviewof the whole problem of international liquidity and its possible solutions.The proposal as it now stands may be rather too elaborate but, if itis agreed by the Gx-oup of Ten, it at least marks an advance in the sense,that these countries recognise that the world may be faced with a long-term liquidity problem and it would be as well to start considering inthe near future how to tackle this problem.United Kingdom Tactics at the International Monetary Fund Meeting7.     My own view remains that sooner or later measures will haveto be taken to increase international liquidit&quot;/.    The output of new goldcoming into the hands of monetary authorities is limited, so is these-2-
authorities1 willingness to hold increasing amounts of reservecurrencies - whether dollars or sterling.   So, by one means or another,we shall have to devise ways of increasing international credit ifthe world&apos;s payments system is to help and not hinder sound economic growth.    At the same time, I do not at present see much chance ofany dramatic advance being made at this year&apos;s International monetary fund meeting.    The Europeans would be suspicious of any move whichlooked as if the Anglo-Saxons were trying to get special treatment tobolster up their balance of payments.    I think therefore the best course is to take advantage of a general agreement among the Group of Tencountries that we now ought to review the whole system, to steeropinion in the direction of building on the structure we already have inthe Fund.    There are many theoretical solutions to the problem of how to provide more international liquidity.    My proposal for a MutualCurrency Account was one - but we could achieve the same objectivesby building on the Fund as it is.    I would be prepared to support theFund Report this year, which speaks in terms of it being &quot;moreimportant and feasible to concentrate on the adaptation or enlargement of the existing multilateral arrangements through the Fund than to seek to establish supplementary or alternative arrangements outside&quot;.8.     I intend, therefore, to support the idea of a general review, butto try and secure agreement of other members of the Group of Tenthat some priority in the review should be given to the desirability of strengthening the Fund through an increase in quotas and by other means.The procedure to secure an increase in quotas is, in any case, long-drawn-out, taking as it does at least two years.    We should thereforebe doing well if we could so influence the progress of the review that definite proposals for an increase in quotas, and for other measures tostrengthen the Fund, were ready in time for the 1964 international monetary Fund meeting.II.   THE INTERNATIONAL, BANK9.      The Governor of the Bank of England has recently been appointed as the United Kingdom Governor of the International Bank for reconstruction and Development, and its affiliates, the international development Association and the International Finance Corporation.In his speech at the Annual Meeting, the Governor will refer to the growing problem presented by the debt-servicing position of the developing nations.    They need development capital, but they cannot afford to borrow on the conventional terms offered by the international bank.10.    The future financial policy of the International Bank is beingconsidered at the present time.    While a number of the developing countries cannot afford to borrow from the Bank, the Eank&apos;s reserves are steadily increasing.    The solution is to arrange, in one way or another, for a transfer of resources from the Bank to its affiliates;but the matter is a complicated one, and it is not yet clear whether there will be a substantive discussion of it at the Annual Meeting.    Itis fairly certain that no conclusions will be reached in the near future.3-
11.     The Governor will also refer to the arrangements for thereplenishment of the resources of the International development association, which makes development credits available on very easyterms.    The industrialised nations have now agreed to raise their contributions from $150 million a year to $250 million a year for thethree-year period beginning in 1965.    Our subscription will increase from $26 million a year to $32 million a year.    It is still high in proportion to our gross national product, but it is not so disproportionatelyhigh as it was for the first period of the life of the Association.    Wehave made some progress towards our objective of parity with Franceand Germany.R.M.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.19th September, 1963-4-
