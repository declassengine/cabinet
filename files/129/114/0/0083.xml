confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  October 1963C. (63) 183 Copy No.   gj[16th October, 1963CABINETIMPORTS OF COTTON TEXTILES FROM THE commonwealth memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeBackgroundWe continue to be under severe pressure from the cotton industry as the resultof the damage inflicted by cheap imports from the Commonwealth which enterduty free and are not subject to any significant degree of categorisation, i.e.,sub-quotas for particular items within the broad totals which the Commonwealthis entitled to ship under the current voluntary limitation agreements which lastuntil the end of 1965. We must expect this industrial pressure to be reinforced bysevere political pressures.2. I explained to my colleagues in July (E.A. (63) 128) that categorisationwould help to reduce the severe price disruption which the United kingdom industry finds exceptionally damaging, assist particular sectors which had beenhard hit and reduce uncertainty as to where the next blows might fall. I suggestedthat short of major changes in policy towards the Commonwealth it was the most useful short-term step we could take to restore a measure of confidence and stability. I pointed out that no other Government in America or the majorWestern European countries fails to provide effective protection for their textile industries; where necessary the GATT Textiles Arrangement is used to impose the most restrictive categorisation.Statement of Government Policies3. I was authorised to state publicly that the Government were satisfied thata reasonable measure of categorisation was desirable and justified to prevent pricedisruption in the home market and that the present state of affairs was alsounsatisfactory for the exporting countries. The Lancashire industry reasonablyinferred from my Statement that they could expect solid support from theGovernment in negotiations which it was hoped would take place with the indian and Hong Kong industries and other countries in like position.Negotiations with India4. The Indian negotiations took place on 11th-13th September and26th-28th September. It was only possible to reach agreement on one category(doubled yarn). The big Indian grey cloth trade was left on the basis that statisticswould be collected next year with a view to further discussion. But the greatestdisappointment to the Lancashire industry was that no agreement could be reached on finished cloth and made-up goods.Hong Kong5. The settlement, such as it was, was dependent on appropriate action oncategorisation by other countries, notably Hong Kong, and there has been no indication so far that the Hong Kong industry is disposed to be accommodating.(Moreover, there is an important practical question. We have been told by the3299
Hong Kong Government that licence allocations for the whole of 1964 will haveto be announced by the end of October 1963 so that no new measures can take effect until the following year.)6. If we leave matters where they are, the slight resurgence of confidence inthe industry apparent after my statement will be dissipated, as will their confidenceijifthe Governmenfs support. The political effect will be the more damaging inview of the expectations of a more positive attitude on the part of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment. Once again it will be said that we have &quot; written off &quot; the cottonindustry in the interests of Asian producers.Finished Cloth and Made-up Goods7. The crucial question, from Lancashire&apos;s point of view, is the treatment of finished cloth and made-up goods. Hong Kong has already secured, in thenegotiations some two years ago, a total figure of 115 million square yards for these items out of an overall quota of 185 million. There are signs that the Indiansare now switching their exports more and more into these items and thusintensifying the damage already inflicted on the United Kingdom industry by thelarge volume which comes from Hong Kong. The United Kingdom industry thusfears that Indian producers will proceed to damage the trade even further in themore advanced textile products, having already succeeded in doing this over thesimpler varieties. During the September talks, however, the Indians were onlyprepared to limit their exports of finished and made-up goods to 50 million square yards (out of an overall quota of 195 million), compared with Lancashire&apos;s proposal of 17 million (with two sub-quotas for particularly critical items within this figure)and a level of trade of about 20 million over the last 12 months.Action by Her Majesty&apos;s government. We must urge the Indians to call a halt. The September discussions haveshown that they will not agree to do so voluntarily at any levels acceptable to theUnited Kingdom industry. We must, therefore, make it clear to them that we areprepared to impose a limit ourselves in default of agreement. The figure I suggest(for the remaining two years of the current agreement) is 25 million square yardsa year which involves a growth factor of some 25 per cent on present trade.Lancashire would say this is too much as compared with the growth provisions inthe Long Term Geneva Arrangement (as well as a clause in their inter-industryagreement which commits the parties to taking steps, after consultation, &quot; to correct any undue distortion which may develop &quot; in &quot; the existing well-definedpattern of trade &quot;). In the circumstances, however, we would have to insist thatthe Government considers 25 million square yards a reasonable figure.GATT and United Nations Considerations9. We cannot impose quotas in default of agreement with the indian government without doing great damage to our international position. It will besaid by less developed countries, inside and outside the Commonwealth, that weare tightening our restrictions on Indian textiles (and the most promising part ofthe trade at that) contrary not only to the voluntary agreement with them but alsoto the proposals of the GATT Action Programme, which we took the lead inendorsing in Geneva last May; and we shall find it an embarrassment in our approach to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development which takes place early next year. Our commercial relations with India may well besoured. It cannot be assumed that the Indian industry will honour thecategorisation of yarn and the collection of statistics of grey cloth which they havealready agreed. They may in fact denounce the whole of the voluntary agreements,thus forcing us to impose quotas over the whole field. This would intensify the apparent inconsistency between our professions and our practices at a criticalmoment in international negotiations, though our record on textiles will of coursestill remain far better than that of any other country.Other Countries10. Whether or not similar action will have to be considered in relation to hong Kong is too early to say but, as I have explained in paragraph 5 above, theprospects of agreement with her appear at present to be gloomy. The position of
Conclusion11. In the last resort, and assuming that India&apos;s agreement to limit their exports as proposed cannot be secured, we have to choose. Either we incur the hostility of India and, perhaps, other under-developed countries in thecircumstances described in paragraph 9 above. Or we shall be accused by theUnited Kingdom industry of again withholding effective support and of being prepared to stand by while their decline continues. This is a painful dilemma. Ihave no hesitation, however, in present circumstances, in recommending that our policy should be aimed at assisting the Lancashire industry whose position hasalready been eroded, to a most damaging extent, as a result of our uniquely liberalattitude towards cheap textile imports.Recommendations12.   Accordingly, I ask my colleagues to agree that(a) our High Commissioner in New Delhi should be instructed to make onelast effort to reach agreement with the Government of India on thebasis of restricting imports of finished cloth and made-up goods to atotal of 25 million square yards (with appropriate sub-quotas),intimating if necessary that we may otherwise have to impose quotasto enforce this;(b) if this fails I should be authorised to impose quotas to a total of25 million square yards on Indian finished cloth and made-up goods.F. E.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,15th October, 1963.Pakistan and Malaya will also have to be considered, although we may, in anycase, be forced to take action if they refuse to renew their voluntary agreements which do not extend beyond the end of 1963. We have already imposed a quotaon Pakistan cotton yarn and have threatened to do the same, if necessary, on theother textile products in order to preserve the limitation arrangements with Indiaand Hong Kong.
