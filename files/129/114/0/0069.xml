THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1963C. (63) 16930th September, 1963CABINETSEVERANCE payments memorandum by the Lord President of the Council and minister for science circulate this memorandum as a report from the Economic Policy Committee,having acted as Chairman in the absence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.2. My colleagues will recall that when they last discussed severance payments(C.C. (63) 52nd Conclusions, Item 4) they-&quot; (2) Invited the Minister of Labour to arrange for further consultations to beheld, in confidence, with representative employers on the practical valueof severance payments and the problems involved in operating schemesfor such payments.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the form of provisions which might been acted in the coming Session, in the light of the consultations held inaccordance with Conclusion (2) above, and to bring this matter beforethe Cabinet again for consideration at a later meeting.&quot;3. The Minister of Labour has now had confidential talks with representativesof the British Employers&apos; Confederation and of LCI. and Unilever.4. The Confederation^ representatives gave him their views as personalappraisals of the likely attitude of the Confederation^ constituents. Broadly, the confederation would prefer a scheme for relating unemployment benefit to earnings, as a measure to assist mobility of labour; but they recognise that there aredifficulties about the early introduction of such a scheme and have indicated thatif the Government decide upon a scheme of severance payments (complying withcertain broad criteria) their members would not be likely to oppose it in principle,although they would certainly want to have full opportunity to examine the detailscritically.5. They raised a number of points on the details of the Minister^ proposals,and, so far as he has thought it right to do so, the Minister has taken account ofthese in the revised summary set out in the Annex to this memorandum. the broad effect is to produce a scheme costing substantially less than the estimated total cost of the Minister^ earlier proposals ( 8-14 million a year for a schemelimited to redundancy;  12-20 million for a straight severance pay scheme).6. They also stressed the need for simplicity in the arrangements. This isnot an easy requirement in a scheme which has to deal with a vast variety of circumstances.7. The burden of the advice from LCI. and Unilever was that their ownseverance pay schemes have done much to help them in their processes ofstreamlining. The two companies hold differing views on some of the details.8. The consultations have not shown any consensus of opinion on thequestion whether it would be better to cover severance generally or redundancyonly.Copy No.673223
9.   The Ministers proposals to the Economic Policy Committee were (1) that he should now open formal consultations with both sides of industry;(2) that he should invite their comments on the proposals in the Annex, whichleave open the choice between providing for severance generally orredundancy only;V&apos; g (3) that in opening the consultations he should say that the Government havedecided to legislate, but have not yet chosen between providing forseverance generally or redundancy only;(4) that legislation should take the form not. as he originally proposed, ofpart of the Industrial Training Bill, but of a separate Bill to beintroduced later in the coming Session this to give time for fullconsultations.10. The Economic Policy Committee agreed that formal consultations with both sides of industry should be the next step (E.A. (63) 40th Meeting, Item 2).11. They also agreed that there is no point in Ministers discussing the detailsof the scheme, including the question whether it should extend to all severance or only to redundancy, until those consultations have been held.12. Most members of the Committee think that it would be a mistake for theGovernment to open the consultations already committed to legislation. This viewrests partly on doubts whether provision for severance or redundancy should notbe left to free negotiation between employers and unions; partly on apprehensionthat some of the yet unsettled points of detail may prove both contentious andintractable; and partly on assessment of the likely divisions of opinion and of theprospects of obtaining legislation in the remaining life of this Parliament.13. The minority of Ministers who hold the contrary view do so because theythink the legislation is desirable mainly on social grounds, but that the two sides of industry will not take the consultations seriously unless it is clear that theGovernment take the subject seriously.HAILSHAM.Office of the Lord President of the Counciland Minister for Science, S.W. 1,30th September, 1963.AnnexOUTLINE OF PROPOSALS FOR LEGISLATION ONSEVERANCE PAYMENTSEmployers will be required to give a lump sum severance payment when theydismiss a full-time worker under age 65 (60 for women) who has worked for themfor more than five years continuously. The circumstances in which payments would be required might be defined in one of two alternative ways:Either(1) where an employee is dismissed for any reason other than misconduct;or(2) where an employee is dismissed because he is redundant. Redundancymight be defined as &quot; Termination of employment because of closure or transfer of the establishment, or changes in the methodof production or distribution or of providing a service, or of fallin demand for products or services other than seasonal orshort-term fluctuations, in circumstances where the employeewould otherwise have had.a reasonable expectation of continuedemployment&quot;.2. An employer will not be obliged to give severance pay if the worker isdismissed for misconduct, or leaves of his own accord, or unreasonably refuses
an offer of a suitable alternative job, or is laid off for a temporary spell only andnot permanently discharged. There will be provision to prevent employers evadingtheir obligations by laying workers off for long periods in the expectation that theywill then leave of their own accord and, thus, not qualify for severance pay.3. Rights to severance pay will accrue for the years of service immediately preceding dismissal (excluding the initial five years with the employer and yearsof service below the age of 21), up to a maximum of 15 years, on the following scale:For each reckonable year of service between ages 26 to 29 \ of a week&apos;spay.For each reckonable year of service between ages 30 to 44 one week&apos;s pay.For each reckonable year of service between ages 45 to 65 (60)-\\ weeks&apos;pay.4. &quot; A week&apos;s pay &quot; will be defined as either an amount settled for thepurpose by collective agreement or a worker&apos;s average weekly minimum pay lessovertime.5. The entitlement of a worker nearing age 65 (60 for women) will be limitedso that it does not exceed what he would have earned had he remained at work.6. Workers will be entitled to severance pay whatever their earnings, but any earnings over  40 a week will be disregarded in calculating the amount due.7. There will be provision for the employer to offset pension and lump sumsuperannuation payments against severance pay.8. Where a worker goes on strike in breach of his contract, the employerwill be allowed to reduce the worker&apos;s entitlement to severance pay by up to one day&apos;s pay for each day or part of a day during which the strike continues.9. The Minister will have power to make loans to employers placed in difficulties by the cost of severance pay in a major redundancy.10. Where an employer become insolvent, the Minister will have power tomake severance payments on his behalf and to proceed against him for recovery of the cost. Debts of severance pay might be given preferential status.11. Disagreements about entitlement to severance pay will be referred foradjudication either by the County Courts or by appeal tribunals specially appointed.Matters which might have to go to adjudication include amount of entitlement,cause of dismissal, refusal of an offer of suitable employment and lay-off (seeparagraph 2).12. The Minister will have power to exempt an employer from the statutory requirements to give severance pay if he is a party to a collective agreement providingfor payments to dismissed workers.13. The legislation will apply to all employments, subject to any specifiedexclusions. It will not bind the Crown, but the Government will give an undertaking that Crown servants will receive not less favourable treatment. Employees onfixed-term contracts of more than five years&apos; duration will also be excluded.14. The Minister will be given power to bring the legislation into operation by Order not less than two years after it is passed.
