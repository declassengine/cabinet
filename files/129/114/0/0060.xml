(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF PIER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)-..............................................-..........-.......-......?rC(63) 160 COPY NO. _19th September, 1963CABINETPUBLIC SERVICE pensions memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster-GeneralThe Cabinet at its meetings on 25th July and 1st August(CO. (63) 49th Conclusions, Minute 1, and C.C.(63) 51st Conclusions,Minute 1), invited me, in consultation with the other Ministers con-cerned, to examine in the light, inter alia, of the current practiceof good employers outside the public service the procedure followedwhen public service pensions are reviewed, and to considerspecifically the position of certain widows of members of the armed forces bereaved before 4th November, 1958.2.       There has been full discussion between officials and I have consulted by letter those of my colleagues who have majorDepartmental interest in this matter.3.       There are two separable issues.    The first is the procedure under which pensions of former members of the Civil and ArmedServices of the Crown and their widows, teachers and other retiredservants of central and local governments, overseas pensioners, etc.are considered.    Secondly, the particular position of what arecolloquially called the &quot;pre-Grigg&quot; widows.Procedure for Review of Public Service Pensions4.       At present improvements in these pensions, which with theexception of members of the Armed Forces requires legislation, areeffected on the initiative of the Government of the day.    Since thewar, Pensions Increase Acts have been carried through parliament in 1947, 1952, 1956, 1959 and 1962, and corresponding improvements have been made by Royal Warrant for members of the Armed Forces.The critics of this system allege that it involves undignified agitationby the pensioners, or by the pressure groups who claim to speak ontheir behalf, and that it would be better to substitute some automaticsystem of review.    This line was taken by a number of Membersduring the debates last autumn on the 1962 Pensions Increase Act,and I undertook to consider whether any improvement in the system was possible.    I did however also indicate that I was not confidentof being able to suggest any improvement.-1-
5.       There are substantial advantages in leaving improvements in public service pensions, like those in National Insurance benefits, tothe initiative and decision of the Government of the day.    It is inthis way possible to adjust the scale and timing of any improvementboth to the needs of the economy and the Governments programme.Nor looked at objectively have the results been unfavourable to the pensioners.    They have in fact fared much better than those of their fellow citizens who have retired on their savings (particularly ifthese were in Government securities) or than the great majority ofthose who enjoy pensions from industry.     Nor is it necessarilywrong that the case for making additional payments from public funds to certain sections of society should be argued out in public.6.       The real objective of the pensioners organisations is &quot;parity&quot;.By this is meant the provision for any pensioner whenever he retiredof a pension as good as that of an official retiring today.7.       Although there has been insufficient time to obtain detailed information, it appears to be the case that parity or somethingpretty near to it in fact applies in respect of public service pensions in a number of Western European countries.8.       There are however formidable objections to introducing ithere, apa.rt from the cost .( 70 million a year).    None of thecolleagues whom I have consulted advocate that we should adopt it.9.       The objections in brief are as follows:-(a) There are grave objections in principle to using the powerof taxation completely to insulate one section of societyfrom any consequence of inflation.    Some of the pensioners,e. g. retired judges and senior officers, enjoy substantiallylarger incomes than many taxpayers whose savings havebeen eroded by inflation.    There is all the difference in theworld between the State as a good employer using its powerof taxation to protect its old employees from hardship and using this same power at the expense of taxpayers vsho maybe poorer than the pensioners completely to insulate publicservice pensioners from inflation regardless of any questionof need or hardship.(b) The most valuable comparison is plainly with good employers in this country.    I attach at Annex A the results of theenquiry undertaken among private employers known to operate generous and progressive schemes.    although these are among the best of employers, none of themprovide parity.(c) It appears that the European countries which adopt this practice in respect of their public service do not also provide social security payments, such as our retire-ment pensions in addition to public service pensions.In this country National Insurance retirement pensionsnot only provide parity, but have been steadily improved in real value under the present Government.    The vast majority of public service pensioners in this countryenjoy these pensions in addition to their public service pensions.-2-
10.      I have however considered other possible modifications inour system.    These are:-(i)  Delegation to an independent review body.    This is not necessary to establish the facts.    These are known.   Itwould be very difficult politically to reject the findings of stich a body.    In practice it would, therefore, meanabandoning the Governments control over timing and amount of increases.    The review body would not be concerned either with the general state of the economy,or the legislative programme.    And our experience of outside review bodies in other connections is far fromencouraging.(ii) An independent committee to consider improvements ofthe present system.    This has been suggested to me bySir Lionel Heald.    Such a body would be likely torecommend a permanent reviewing body.    If we wereto decide to set one up it would be better to do so on ourown initiative.(iii) Another possibility would be to incx*ease public service pensions automatically, not by reference to currentpension levels, but by reference to movements in e. g,the Index of Retail Prices.    But this is hardly less objectionable than parity.    hi particular it wouldequally insulate one section of the population from theeffects of inflation and take the control of the scale and timing of pensions increase out of the hands of theGovernment.    It is material that such a system wasapplied to certain Armed Forces pensions after the1914-1918 war, but was abandoned in 1935, owing to thedifficulties which had arisen when prices fell.    Therewould moreover be important repercussions on theNational Insurance scheme.    Index-linking for pension would greatly strengthen existing pressures to linknational insurance benefits to the movement of average earnings, and consequently tie the Governments handagain in this much wider and more expensive field(expenditure on benefits is currently running at nearly 1,400 million a year, excluding war pensions,industrial injuries and family allowances).(iv) An undertaking to hold regular reviews, say everythree years.    A three-year review is not, as appears from paragraph 4 of this paper, very different from recent practice.    But it could involve the Governmentin very awkward questions of timing and would notprotect us from an earlier review, if for exampleprices rose sharply.    It would, however, be much less damaging than the other courses referred to above.11.      My own view is that we should retain the present system.   If,however, later on, serious pressure should develop we could fallback on the expedient referred to in the preceding paragraph, though doubt whether it would give very much satisfaction.-3-CO NFS DENTS AL
sit r- pArmed Services Widows Bereaved Before 4th November, 1958;(the &quot;pre-Grigg&quot; Widows)12.      The proposal put forward by the Minister of Defence is thatthe pensions of these widows should be increased by putting them onthe same basis as widows bereaved after 4th November, 1958,13.      The pensions in question are of course those paid to the widows of members of the Armed Forces who died before or afterretirement from causes not attributable to service.       Wheredeath was so attributable additional pension is paid - or a pension is paid where it would not otherwise be payable.    These additionsor pensions are calculated on different principles and are not herein question.    What we are here dealing with are the occupational pensions of members of the Armed Forces.14.      The general principle in respect of public service pensionsis that while improvements are frequently made in the pensions bypensions increase and related measures, the basis on which theyare awarded is not altered in the light of changes made subsequently.Apart from the merits of this proposal, it is therefore particularlynecessary to consider the consequences in related fields of a deliberate abandonment of this principle in respect of these particular widows.    Once we accept that it is indefensible to payable different pension because a retirement or bereavement took placeon the wrong side of a particular date, we may find ourselves veryeasily on the road to parity.15.      It is this consideration rather than the direct cost of the concession suggested which appears to..have caused the government when this issue was raised in 1959 and 1962 to decide not to givepost-Grigg treatment to pre-Grigg widows but to help them in otherways.16.      As the result of the Grigg Report a number of improvementswere made in Armed Forces regular service pensions.    The pensions of the widows were put on to a more favourable basis - one-thirdof the husband&apos;s pension, which itself was increased.    The scope ofentitlement to pension of other ranks&apos; widows was widened.    Forexample, prior to 4th November, 1958, the widow of a Corporal or private received no pension unless her husband had completed32 years&quot; service.    In the case of bereavements after 4th November,1958, a widow of a man of these ranks became entitled to pension ifhe had completed 22 years&apos; service.17.      As a consequence, whereas a bereavement of an officer&apos;swidow immediately prior to 4th November, 1958, results in herreceiving a lower pension than if it had incurred immediately thereafter, in the case of a widow of a large number of other ranksthe earlier date of bereavement prevents her from obtaining apension at all.18.      The proposal therefore to secure that an officer&apos;s widowshall receive the same rate of pension whether her husband&apos;s deathoccurred before or after the 4th November, 1958, raises very-4-
9 F p?sharply the question whether at the same time the widow of another rank who is now receiving no pension but would have done so had her bereavement taken place later shall also be put in thesame position as a widow bereaved later, i. e. given a pension forthe first time.19.      The Minister of Defence, and as I understand it, theOfficers Pensions Society, favour discriminating in this Way.    Iam bound to say that I see great political difficulty in defendingin the House of Commons or to public opinion such discrimination in dealing in one way with what are predominantly the widows ofofficers, and in another with what are in all cases the widows ofother ranks.     The difficulty in so doing would be accentuated by what has been said on behalf of the Government on this issue.    I attach a selection of these statements at Annex B.    It is also worth noting that the Opposition have already indicated in earlier debatesthat a concession to the widows of officers could not in their view be denied to widows of other ranks.20.      The immediate cost of the concession to pre-Grigg widowsalready in receipt of pension would be  236, 000 a year.    Inaddition, some  80, 000 a year would be payable to widows ofmembers of the old Indian Army.    This does not include any provision for payment of new pensions to pre-Grigg other ranks&apos;widows now not pensionable, and as the Service Departments areno longer in touch with these women, no precise figure is available.    It would probably be of the order of  7 or  8 million a year.21.      The first question which the Cabinet will wish to consider is whether or not it would be tolerable to alter the basis of the pensions of officers&apos; widows and those of the limited number of other ranksalready pensionable, while doing nothing for the unpensioned widow/sof other ranks.22.      Even the more limited (officers&apos; widows) concession, withthe breach of the principle set out in paragraph 14, would involve serious repercussions throughout the public service field and beyondit.    The wider change (i. e. dealing also with the other ranks&apos;widows) would produce even wider reactions.    This view is shared by the colleagues I have consulted.23.      It is not possible within a paper of tolerable length fully toset out all the likely repercussions from such changes;  I will endeavour to summarise these below.24.      The most obvious repercussion is on the pensions of theretired officers themselves, and hence after 1958 on those of theirwidows.    If it is considered intolerable to permit an officer&apos;swidow&apos;s pension to be determined by the date of the bereavementbeing before or after 4th November, 1958, it becomes difficult todefend the officer&apos;s own pension being so affected.    And from thatit is a very easy step to say that subsequent Pay Codes should beapplied even though the officer retired before they came into effect.And as widows&apos; pensions now are determined by the size of the-5-confidential 
officers&apos; own pension, these widows pensions would also be broughton to the new codes.    Here we get quickly into substantial sums.The cost of bringing on to the 1962 code those widows at presenteligible for a pension would be a further   1 million a year.25.      There would also be strong repercussions in the&quot;attributable&quot; widows field.    These are the widows who lost their husbands as a result of the latters1 war service.    Women widowedbefore 3rd September, 1939. can only receive a war widow&apos;pension if they married their late husband before his acceptedinjury (except where that injury was sustained before 1st October,1931, and 3rd September, 1939).    To concede these would costa further  ;! million a year, decreasing subsequently.26.      The major repercussion would be in respect of widows ofCivil Servants who died before 14th July, 1949, the date on whichthe Widows and Children&apos;s Pension Scheme embodied in the superannuation Act, 1949, took effect.    No pensions are paid atpresent where the husband&apos;s death took place before that date.There is in particular an exact parallel between the position of widows of Civil Servants who died in harness shortly before july, 1949, and that of widows of other ranks in the Armed forces who died for non-attributable causes in service shortly before november, 1958, with service insufficient to qualify for pension under the then rules, but sufficient to qualify under the post-Griggrules.    The cost of extending pensions to these widows would be afurther  1-g- million a year.27.      A change of this kind would also react on a number of other schemes of provision for widows of other former members of thepublic service and employees of nationalised industries.    Forinstance, the scheme for widows of teachers in Scotland is in an advanced state of preparation and may be followed by one for widows of teachers in England and Wales.    Acceptance of the doctrine that the date of widowhood should not affect pension rights would lead us in these directions to strong demands for grant ofpension to &quot;existing&quot; widows.    There would also plainly be pressure from the widows of policemen who retired before 1956, and of firemenwho died from injury on duty, and from local authority staffs who retired on or before 30th September, 1950.    Li the nationalised industries there could well be similar claims from the widows of miners who retired before 1952 and from the widows of railwaymen.28.      There might well be further reactions in the sphere of social security.    The argument of the 10s. widows is precisely that their husbands died before an arbitrary date.    Merely to double the 10s.pension would cost about  3-g- million a year, and it is the officialpolicy of the Labour Party to increase it to 30s.    Behind this there looms the problem of the so-called &quot;pensionless&quot;.     Thereare two-thirds of a million of these and the cost of giving them aretirement pension would be approximately  35 million a year.These are the people not previously in National Insurance who were too old to be brought in on 5th July, 1948.    They have alwaysclaimed that they should be given the National Insurance pensionor its equivalent.    There are similar claims in respect of peopleinjured in industry prior to the introduction of the NationalInjuries Act, 1946.-6-
29.      Without troubling my colleagues with, further examples, itis, I think, only too clear how grave are the dangers involved inyielding to the argument that it is unfair that the happening of acertain benefit before or after a particular date, should not affectthe principle on which a pension is based.30.      None the less, there is justifiably much understandablesympathy with these ladies;  and if there were no other way of bringing help to them I would agree that we ought to give serious consideration to this proposal.31.      But that is not the case.32.      Last year the position was considered by the then Ministerof Defence and my predecessor.    It was felt that some help shouldbe given to these ladies but that for the reasons set out above itwould be imprudent to give them post-Grigg terms.33.      In order further to give help in particular to the pre-Griggwidows, the provision was inserted in the 1962 Pensions IncreaseAct, under which, in addition to substantial increases on a percent-age basis in public service pensions, a lump sum of  20 a year should be paid to public service pensioners over 70.    It is clear from the records that although this was, in my view, rightlyextended to all public service pensioners of the appropriate age, themain purpose behind it was to deal with the case of pre-Grigg widows.34.       The Pensions Increase Act, 1962, which came into operationwith effect from the beginning of this year, as a result provided very substantial increases in their pension for the ladies in question.For instance, the pre-Grigg widow of a Major aged 70 or over,received an increase of 24 per cent in her pension which was increased from  162 to  201 a year, and the pre-Grigg widow ofa Captain of the same age had her pension increased by 28 per cent from  127 to  162 a year.35. As a result both in absolute terms and relatively to other public service pensioners, the position of these widows is betterthan it has ever previously been.36.      I think that it also follows that we should not contemplate any further increase for them, by whatever method it is to beachieved, for some little time to come.    Indeed, to do so so soon after increases of this order, and in the light of the stability shown by the index of retail prices would give an impression of uncertainty and muddle.37.      When the time comes for a further increase my view is that  /e should continue to avoid the serious consequences outlined above which would plainly flow from an alteration in the basic formula bywhich these pensions are determined, but should seek again, as onthis occasion, to effect general improvements in a way which givesproportionately greater help  to the older pensioner.    In this way we can meet the substance of the problem without involving ourselves in embarrassing consequential decisions and expensive repercussions.J. A.B-C.Treasury Chambers, S. v/. 1.19th September, 1963.-7-
1.      The Treasury has enquired of 20 of the largest private employerstheir practice as to increasing pensions.     The Government Actuaryadvised on the selection of employers and the largest and best over a wide range of commercial activities were chosen.    This must tend to&quot;weight&quot; the sample in the pensioners&apos; favour as being a sample ofwhat the best employers do.2. Sixteen replies have so far been received and examined. one company has given details of two different schemes so that this reportcovers seventeen different schemes.Schemes3.      The enquiry called for details of the level of benefit providedby the respective pension schemes.    With, three exceptions, all theschemes give pension benefits that are very broadly in line with those given to civil servants and other public service employees.    That is,pensions are related to length of service and salary in the last few yearsof service by a fraction of between l/60-th and l/80th.    One or two schemes differ from this description but their effect is about the same.Of the three real exceptions, two schemes have been recently improved,but the increases reported relate to the old unimproved schemes.Increases4.     After making allowance for the numbers of persons covered by each of these seventeen schemes, the average increases enjoyed bytheir pensioners are broadly the same as the benefits of the Pensions(Increase) Acts.    Some schemes give increases that are inferior, afew are better, and the majority have both points where they are better, and points where they are less good.    Some have a bias one way or the other and some about balance.    Of the seventeen schemes:-(i)     two schemes give no pensions increase except that one ofthem has applied changes in the minimum rate to existingpensions;(ii)     foui* schemes increase only the oldest and smallest pensions,and that to an extent less than the Pensions Increase Actsincreases.    Two of these schemes are currently underreview;(iii)     seven schemes more or less balance out.    Of these, two areoverall less generous than the Acts, and two are rather more generous.    This group includes one scheme that is better at first sight, but the pensions are based on salaryaveraged over the whole career which, because of inflationduring the working life, tends to be inferior to normalpension schemes.    Similar pensions to civil sexwantspensioned under the Federated Superannuation System forUniversities also receive increases larger than those givenby the Acts, so that this scheme can also be said to giveapproximately the same level of increases as are given tocomparable public servants;-8-ANNEX A
CONI:3DENT3AL261(iv)     three schemes give benefits that are generally better than thoseof the Acts, hut are inferior at some points.    One is betterthan the Acts because it is rather generous for recentpensioners without obvious justification, but we understandthat there have been large surpluses on the pension fund,disclosed by actuarial review, which have been used toincrease pensions;(v)      one scheme is definitely better than the Acts.    It is the schemeof one of the largest and most prosperous companies in thecountry.    Some pension fund surpluses have been appliedto increases but that is not advanced as a major factor. &apos;Basis of Increases5.      These increases, where paid, have all been determined onempirical grounds.    None derived from any automatic review orlink with cost of living, wages or any other factor.    Cost of livinghas been taken into account in most cases, current wages in many,but no scheme designedly gives either full compensation for rises in the cost of living or parity.      When one of the markedly inferiorpension schemes was improved, existing pensions were revised (ona basis that was still inferior to the public service level of pensions)taking account also of the change in the cost of living between theyear of retirement and 1957.    This adjustment has not, so far, been repeated so that these pensioners are not currently fully compensated for rises in the cost of living (except for old pensions, the benefit is less than that of the Pensions (Increase) Acts).    In some cases,surpluses on the Superannuation Fund have been material to agreater or lesser extent.    Since a large part of the increases havebeen financed by the employers, what could be afforded has enteredinto the calculations and is admitted to have played a large part inone of the inferior schemes in 4(ii) above.     A few schemes  take account of the level of National Insurance retirement pensions in determining increases.-9-
MINISTERIAL, STATEMENTS ON REPERCUSSIONS OF AREASSESSMENT OF THE PENSIONS OF &quot;PRE-GRIGG&quot; WIDOWSLord Carrington;  House of Lords:   23. 11.60 (Col. 1851)&quot;When the family pensions of the Armed Forces were improved in 1959, the Government considered very carefully whether these improvements could be extended to those who were already widows.They concluded, however, that it was quite impossible to distinguish between these widows and any other category of existing pensioners and that to re-assess flieir pensions, except on the basis of hardship,would not be justified unless all other public service pensions were tobe re-assessed as well.    Indeed, the principles which apply to other public service pensioners clearly apply equally to widows. &quot;Sir Edward Boyle:  House of Commons (Deedes Motion); 25.5.62 (Col. 929)&quot;The Government decided that there was no basis on which thesewidows could be distinguished from other categories of existing pensioners and that to re-assess their pensions in the light of the recommendationsof the Grigg Committee could not be justified unless all other publicservice pensions were to be re-assessed at the same time. &quot;Lord Dundee:  House of Lords (P. I. Bill):  27. 11.62 (Cols. 1197-98)&quot;They /the Government/ concluded that it v/as not possible to distinguish between these widows and any other category of existingpensioners, and that if they tried to re-assess their pensions (except,of course, on the discriminatory basis of hardship which was another matter), that would not be justified unless all other public service pensions were to be re-assessed as well.    It was decided that theprinciple which applied to other public service pensioners should apply equally to widows. &quot;-10-
