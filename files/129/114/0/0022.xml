C. (63) 1229th July, 1963COPY NO.CABINETREPLACEMENT OF THE &quot;QUEEN MARY&quot;Memorandum by of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee have considered a new proposal from Cunard for a &quot;Q.4&quot;.2.      Cunard say that the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; can carry on at any ratethrough the summer of 1964, but not, at most, beyond 1966.    The&quot;Queen Elisabeth&quot; has several more years&apos; life, but Cunard think It most unlikely that she can be operated economically without a sistership.3.      It would take four years to produce a new &quot;Queen&quot;, so that ifthe withdrawal of both &quot;Queens&quot; in 1966-67 or earlier is to be avoided,a decision must be taken now about a replacement for the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;.We have to give Cunard our answer to their proposal in good time before their Annual General Meeting on 26th July.4.

The Economic Policy Committee have agreed that the Governmentshould reject the proposal.-1-
6.     The Committee&apos;s reasons are as follows:(a) We had difficulty in persuading Parliament to accept the &quot;Q. 3&quot;proposal.    For the Exchequer the new proposal is much worse;    Wehave been asked under both proposals to contribute  18 million, butwhereas Cunard were to contribute  12 million for the &quot;Q. 3&quot;, they wouldonty contribute  4 million for &quot;Q.4&quot;.    Moreover, whereas they wouldhave paid 4j per cent over 25 years on the Exchequer money for &apos;&quot;Q. 3&quot;,they propose 4 per cent over 25 years for &quot;Q.4&quot;.    The terms of the credit Scheme for shipbuilding are at present 4 &apos;/ q per cent over 10 years.The security offered for the loan for the &quot;Q.4&quot; would also be inferior tothat for &quot;Q.3&quot;.(b) Members of the General Council of Eritish Shipping have made itclear that they are against the proposal, or that, if it is accepted, othershipping companies will seek subsidy.    They will have the stronger case for this because it is intended that &quot;G.4&quot; would be used partly forcruising.(c) If Exchequer money is to be invested in a project there should either be evidence, from the extent of private backing, that it iscommercially sound, or else it should be worth supporting on technologicalgrounds.    In this case there is no technological innovation, and Cunard1 sown financial stake is small.(d) Cunard&apos;s management does not inspire confidence.7.      The Committee were not opposed in principle to Britain remaining in the express luxury Transatlantic service even at some cost to theExchequer, and they recognised that national prestige is involved and that opinion in the country is likely to be divided.    But they felt that theGovernment would not be justified in entertaining a proposal that didnot afford an acceptable basis for Government assistance.8,      The Committee have considered how best to present rejection ofthe proposal.    This must not be left to Cunardj  a carefully timedstatement by the Government will be required.    There would be advantage in announcing at the same time an increase in the amount of Governmentcredit to be made available for shipbuilding under the new Credit Scheme,if this is justified on merits;  and the Committee have invited theMinister of Transport to present to the Treasury specific proposals for extending that scheme.    They have also invited theMinister of Transport, in consultation with the Chief Secretary and theMinister without Portfolio, to consider the presentation of the Governmentsanswer to Cunard.R.M.Treasury Chambers, S. 77.1.8th July, 1963-2-

Hl* REPORT OF THE CENTRAL AFRICA CONFERENCE 1963Chapter 1INTRODUCTIONOn 18th June, 1963, the First Secretary of State, the Rt. Hon. R. A.Butler, C.H., M.P., announced in the House of Commons that the Govern-ment of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and the Governmentsof Southern and Northern Rhodesia had agreed to attend a Conferenceon the orderly dissolution of the Federation and the consequential problems involved. The Nyasaland Government had agreed to send observers.This Conference met at the Victoria Falls Hotel, Southern Rhodesia, on28th June and completed its work on 3rd July, 1963. A list of thosewho attended the Conference is at Annex A.2. There was full agreement among all delegations that arrangements should be made for the orderly and speedy transfer of Federalresponsibilities to the territories. There were many difficult and complexproblems to be solved which could not be dealt with fully at theConference. It would be the task of the Conference to set up the necessary machinery for a detailed study of these problems and to set a time-table for the processes of dissolution.3. The Conference agreed that there was a range of functions whichcould be transferred without great difficulty, provided that satisfactory arrangements were reached regarding the officers manning these servicesand the finances for them. It was also agreed that, where it might be practicable, arrangements should be made for the transfer of such services to territorial responsibility in advance of dissolution. This would includetransfer of those subjects where the Federal Government had a constitu-tional responsibility in respect of one territory only.4. The Conference also agreed that there were certain matters onwhich the post-Conference machinery should be given guidance. First therewere the important problems of the Federal Public Service and the appor-tionment of assets and liabilities including the public debt. There was a range of functions in which the question of inter-territorial collaborationarose. There were the problems connected with the transfer of taxationfunctions to the territories. The question of defence needed specialexamination and there were also problems connected with citizenship andthe question of an appeal court to replace the Federal Supreme Court.5. The Conference first considered these matters and in the light ofits conclusions thereon proceeded to examine the machinery which wouldbe needed to carry forward the detailed implementation of the processes of dissolution.6. The next chapter of this report outlines the machinery which theConference agreed should be established. The succeeding chapters sum-marise the discussions of the Conference on particular issues of importance for the guidance of those who will be responsible for carrying forward the work of the Conference.30792
Chapter IIMACHINERY7. The United Kingdom and Southern Rhodesia Delegations each tabledsets of proposals providing in different ways for a system of committees.The Northern Rhodesia Delegation indicated that their approach to theproblem was different. They considered that the United Kingdom Govern-ment should at an early date appoint a Commissioner to take over allfunctions of the Federal Government, and then to arrange for the progre-sive transfer of those functions to the territorial governments ; they feltthat this arrangement would assist a clear cut change of regime at an earlydate and avoid the embarrassment to the Federal Government of being left at the end with only a handful of minor functions to administer. Thisview was not, however, accepted by any other delegation, on the grounds that the processes of dissolution ought to be worked out between theGovernments in advance of some date at which the dissolution could andshould take place. It was also made clear by the Chairman that the concept of appointing a Commissioner to inherit the functions of theFederal Government formed no part of Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ policy.8. The Conference agreed to remit to a sub-committee further examina-tion of the two sets of proposals made by the United Kingdom and SouthernRhodesia Delegations. The sub-committee reported substantially on thelines set out in the following paragraph, and after discussion which covered the understandings recorded in paragraphs 11 and 12 below, the Conferenceadopted their proposals.9. In consequence, the Conference agreed that, immediately after theConference, two official committees should be established as follows:  Committee &quot; A &quot; (General Committee)(i) Composition. Officials representing the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, the Federation, and Southern and Northern Rhodesia, under a united Kingdom Chairman appointed after consultation with the other three Governments.(ii) Terms of Reference.(a) To work out detailed arrangements for the reversion of federal government functions to territorial responsibility, in such manner and order as may best contribute to their speedy and orderlyreversion.(b) To work out solutions of general problems arising from the dis-solution of the Federation particularly as regards the federal public Service (including in this term Parliamentary officers and members of statutory bodies), the armed forces and the judiciary.(c) To make recommendations as to the means of dealing with Federalassets and liabilities (including the public debt) and, if they con-sidered an Apportionment Commission to be required, to make a reference to the Governments accordingly, including recommendations as to its terms of reference, powers and composition.
v    iii) Directive.id) The Committee would be an inter-governmental negotiating bodythrough which the representatives would seek to reach agreement by reference to their respective Governments as necessary as thework progressed.(6).,The Committee would be empowered to set up separate sub-committees for the examination of particular functions. The Com-mittee should be required to set up special sub-committees for theconsideration of:  (1) Federal Public Service, and(2) Assets and liabilities.(c) The presence of a United Kingdom representative on each of the twosub-committees mentioned above was essential for their speedyand effective operation. The Chairman appointed by the Com-mittee for each sub-committee should be acceptable to all theGovernments concerned.id) Each Government would appoint one principal (co-ordinating)representative to the Committee but would be free to nominate atwill additional or alternate representatives (or advisers) to theCommittee and its sub-committees in accordance with the subjectunder discussion.Committee &quot; B &quot; (Committee on inter-territorial questions)(i) Composition. Officials representing the territorial governmentsassisted by Federal officials, under United Kingdom chairmanship.(ii) Terms of Reference. To work out in respect of those Federal functionsreferred to it by Committee &quot; A &quot; detailed arrangements for the reversionof those functions to territorial responsibility having regard to the pos-sibility of collaboration between the territories in particular fields.(iii) Directive. The Committee&apos;s method of procedure and their powersto set up sub-committees as necessary would generally be the same as forCommittee &quot; A&quot;. In particular each Government, including the UnitedKingdom Government, would be entitled to appoint additional representa-tives, alternates or advisers. This Committee would not submit its con-clusions in all cases to the Federal Government, but when making submission-sions to the constituent governments would keep the Federal government informed whether or not action by the Federal Government was contem-plated ; where action by the Federal Government was required,consultation should take place before any final conclusion was reached.10. The Chairman of Committee &quot; A &quot; would be charged with the general responsibility io his Committee, of co-ordinating the work of the two com-mittees so as to secure an orderly and expeditious process of dissolution andtransition to a new regime in accordance with the broad decisions of theConference.11. The Conference agreed to the arrangements described above on theunderstanding that where a territorial government considered that its arrange-ments, particulary as to staff and finance, were such as to enable it to take
over a Federal function, there should be no delay in that transfer beflweffected. Governments would, however, consult together so that in most cases Federal functions should be taken over simultaneously by the territories.12. It was also agreed that if any territorial government objected, in committee &quot; A &quot;, to the remit of any subject, affecting its own future powers,to Committee &quot; B &quot;, that decision should be final, and the subject so faras it affected the objecting territory, should be considered further only in committee &quot; A &quot;.i3. The Conference considered that the effective operation of themachinery would be hampered unless the Nyasaland Government were fullyassociated with it on the same terms ; lack of Nyasaland&apos;s association would tend to delay the operation, rather than the reverse. The Conference there-fore invited the Chairman to seek the agreement of the Nyasaland Governmentto associate itself with the machinery.Chapter IIIFEDERAL PUBLIC SERVICE14. There was general agreement that on the reversion of Federal functions to territorial governments as many Federal officers as possible, of all races,should be absorbed in the territorial public services.15. The first problem to which the post-Conference machinery shouldturn its attention was comprehensive terminal arrangements for the federal public Service, which would ensure the equitable treatment of Federal officerswhose employment was brought to an end.16. As a part of these comprehensive arrangements the territorial governments would need to state as soon as possible the terms of servicethey would offer and the extent to which, having regard to their own publicservice policies, further employment could be offered to Federal officers.17. The post-Conference machinery would also need to reach agreement on arrangements for securing the discharge of the pension liability for past and present Federal officers and their dependants. Liabilities in respectof pensions (and the precise nature of these liabilities) would be a matter for the post-Conference machinery to consider and would need to be assessedand distributed as part of the general apportionment of assets and liabilities of the Federation. These arrangements would need to cover the presentFederal Pension Fund which covered only a proportion of the Federal officersand was not yet actuarially viable.18. The Northern Rhodesia Delegation drew attention to the fact thatit would take some time to evolve these detailed arrangements and forGovernments to consider and finally approve them. They reminded theConference that on the creation of the Federation officers had been com-pulsorily seconded from the territorial Government to the Federal Governmentfor a period of two years. They considered that a similar procedure wouldbe natural and appropriate on the dissolution of the Federation and proposedthat this period of secondment should be one year. The Southern Rhodesiarepresentatives agreed that an interim period would be needed for theapplication of the full public service arrangements but they expressed the
fv that they could probably maintain their services during this perioda process of voluntary secondment. The Federal representatives pointedout that under regulations made under the Federal Public Service act the consent of an officer was required to his secondment to another govem-ment and that when the secession of Nyasaland was announced the federal government had given an undertaking to the Federal Public ServiceAssociation that these regulations would be observed. Accordingly theFederal representatives said that they could not consider supporting any arrangements to cover this interim period that would involve compulsorysecondment until there had been full consultation and agreement with theFederal Public Service Association.19. The Conference recognised that some standstill arrangement forstaff would be needed, following the transfer of departments to territorialcontrol, although the Federal Government made it plain that this shouldnot involve any compulsion. In the light of the detailed examination ofsuch an arrangement by a sub-committee, consultations with the federal public Service Association were begun during the period of the Conference.20. The Conference agreed that the post-Conference machinery shouldtake full account of the views of delegations including the reservationsentered by the Federal Government in the arrangements to be made tocover this standstill period, and should continue the consultations begunwith the Federal Public Service Association as part of the general discussions that would be necessary with the association about the comprehensive settle-ment of public service issues.Chapter IVFEDERAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDING PUBLIC DEBT21. The Federal Government submitted a paper containing a survey of the Governments financial obligations, including the public debt. Thepaper pointed out that these obligations rested on the resources andreflected the credit-worthiness of the Federal economy. In the opinion ofthe Federal Government, the dissolution of the Federation as an economic unit would involve a loss of economic strength ; and the separate territorialeconomies should not be expected between them to meet the obligations which had been incurred on a scale appropriate to the Federation as awhole. If they attempted to do so, a great part of their product wouldbe absorbed in this task, and their capacity to finance much-neededdevelopment would be unduly restricted. Since the dissolution of theFederation was an exercise of Britahrs sovereign power, Britain should, inthe interests of the territories and of the creditors, assume responsibilityfor the Federal Government^ obligations. It should look to the territoriesfor reimbursement on a scale related to their assets and revenues ; assets which did not become part of the capital equipment of a territorial economyshould be transferred to the United Kingdom.22. The Federal Delegation explained that their concern was to see thattheir financial obligations including guarantees and moral obligations werehonoured. This involved the acceptance of responsibilities not only by theterritorial governments but also by the British Government whose action indissolving the Federation made it impossible for the Federal Government
to honour its obligations. The two principles involved were the safeguardof public credit and the need to avoid calling on the territories to pay morethan their economies could bear.23. Sir George Curtis analysed the obligations of the Federal Govern-ment in the light of the discussions in the Nyasaland Working Party. He classi-fied them into five groups, viz, those relating to the Federal Public Service;Federal Government guarantees of loans; continuing obligations to variousinstitutions; other loans including Federal loans relent to territorial govern-ments; and a group of miscellaneous liabilities mainly related to claims bythe public. He observed that even when the problem of apportioning financialliability for these loans and debts had been solved there would remain theproblem of securing them in the interests of creditors.24. The Southern Rhodesia Delegation said that the three territoriescould not as separate units carry the same burden of debt as the Federation.Assessments of the amount of debt each territory could carry should relateto its revenue earning capacity; only the United Kingdom could bridge the gap between that amount and the money the Federal Government owed. TheSouthern Rhodesia Government was prepared to accept its fair share of liability for public debt arising from the dissolution of the Federation, but many Federal assets were bound to depreciate on reversion to the territories and it would be unfair if they were apportioned on the basis of their formervaluations. Many fixed assets also might not be required by the territories inthe same shape or size.25. The Northern Rhodesia Delegation^ view was that machinery shouldbe set up to examine these problems, including pre-Federal debt, loans to statutory bodies, and the legal liability for the Federal Governmenfs open market borrowing. The machinery would deal with Federal assets as theother side of the problem of public debt. The Northern Rhodesia Governmentwas willing to take over its fair share of Federal liabilities and public debt.26. The territorial governments reserved their position as to how theirshares should be assessed until the post-Conference machinery had reported.The United Kingdom Delegation expressed the view that if the UnitedKingdom Government took over liability for debts, it would also have totake over the corresponding assets and thus introduce a second governmentinto another governmenfs territory.27. The Chairman made it clear that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs actionin dissolving the Federation was based on their assessment of the politicalrealities of the situation. It was true that the acceptance of Federal liabilitieswould impose a burden on the territories but many valuable and indeedessential assets would also pass to the territories and it would surely be wrong to divorce the question of assets from that of liabilities. Broadly speaking,liabilities were the counterpart of benefits which accrued to the territoriesindividually or collectively. Difficulties might well arise in certain cases butthe right approach to the whole question was to start from the connection between assets and liabilities. This approach would not pre-judge considera-tion at a later stage of the capacity of the territories to carry the burden andthe position of the Federation^ creditors in the new circumstances. Thepost-Conference machinery should start their work on the basis of seeingwhere in consequence of the re-allocation of functions the assets werephysically likely to lie, and apportioning the liabilities, including the public
&apos;lbt among the three successor governments in such a way as broadly to correspond with the division of assets and to deal equitably with any anomalieswhich might arise. It was then that there would emerge the question whether any territory would be saddled with too heavy a debt burden, since it wouldbe seen exactly what responsibilities would fall to it. At that stage it wouldbe for consideration between governments what means might be adopted tolighten the burden. The question whether the United Kingdom Governmentcould and should help would have to be considered in the light of their general policies on overseas aid towards countries which showed need for assistancein the development of their economies. It would be in accordance with these policies for the United Kingdom Government to consider the need of a commonwealth territory, within the limits of their resources and the callsupon them in the light of such territory&apos;s economic position as a whole including of course its debt burden.28. The Conference agreed that the whole matter should be referred to acommittee to be set up under post-Conference machinery.Chapter VINTER-TERRITORIAL COLLABORATION29. The Chairman suggested to the Conference that some thought shouldbe given to the range of subjects in which questions of inter-territorialcollaboration arose.30. There were two reasons for this. The first was the practical one that,unless broad conclusions were reached on how inter-territorial issues wereto be tackled, the machinery to dissolve the Federation could not workspeedily and effectively, as these issues were interlocked with the processes of dissolution.31. The second consideration was the interests of the territories and thefuture prosperity of the region and its inhabitants. The Chairman reminded the Conference that it was the United Kingdom Governments declared policy to seek to assist in the evolution of effective new forms of collaboration between the territories when the Federation came to an end, forms whichwould be acceptable to each of them and help to preserve and promote,in particular, the economic prosperity of all. Serious thought should begiven to the ways in which the benefits of association might be preservedthrough new forms of collaboration.32. The essential core of this association lay in the shared economic arrangements, such as the common market in goods and labour, and thejoint banking, credit, exchange and currency facilities. There were hereissues of great complexity and vital importance to each territory, whichcalled for most thorough and searching examination by each government.This was essentially a matter for the territories, and their decisions would havefar reaching effects on their future finances and economy.33. There was also the field of common services, in which Kariba andthe railways were obviously of particular significance to both the Rhodesias :and other fields, such as freedom of movement between the territories, inwhich the governments might wish to consider mutual arrangements for thefuture.
34. Whatever decisions the territorial governments might reach on leapterms arrangements for the future, there would be need before dissolution toreach agreement at least on transitional arrangements if the prosperity ofthe area was not to be jeopardised. The process of transferring functions to separate governments could be difficult and complicated ; and, for example,during any transitional period, local confidence in the currency must be main-tained if serious economic damage were to be avoided, and therefore theCentral Bank must be given adequate authority to continue in the new circumstances, if only as a temporary arrangement. There were similar problems in relation to customs and posts and telecommunications among other subjects: and all this would call for close co-operation between thegovernments.35. The Chairman therefore proposed that provision should be includedin the post-Conference machinery for a body to carry forward further study of questions of inter-territorial collaboration, without commitment at thisstage by any government to any particular form of future collaboration. Itwould be understood that on dissolution constitutional responsibility forthe functions in which such inter-territorial issues arose would revert to theterritorial governments, and any joint arrangements for the future wouldbe based on the territories exercising their separate powers in agreement.36. The Federal Delegation agreed that this was a matter for theterritorial governments. The Northern Rhodesia Delegation indicated thattheir Government accepted in principle that there should be inter-territorialcollaboration in regard to the railways, Kariba and Central African Airways,and recognised the possible need for interim joint arrangements in suchmatters as currency. The Southern Rhodesia Delegation welcomed this statement, but hoped that collaboration with the Northern Rhodesia Govern-ment might go beyond the subjects mentioned.Chapter VITRANSFER OF MONEY AND TAXATION FUNCTIONS37. The Northern Rhodesia Delegation said that satisfactory arrange-ments for the transfer of money and taxation functions were an essentialprerequisite to the transfer of services. The main requirements were thatthe financial arrangements:(a) must be as simple as possible ;(b) must provide a firm basis in advance for the return of services ;(c) must provide a firm basis for the general financial settlement;(d) must be acceptable as fair and reasonable by all governments ;(e) must allow territorial governments to administer a service takenback according to its own requirements.38. The main difficulty was that income tax receipts varied widely overthe year and the position oould be affected substantially as between oneyear and another by the speed with which assessments were issued and dealt
fch. The transfer of effective fiscal powers should therefore coincide either^Tth the beginning of the tax year (1st April) or with the beginning of thefinancial year (1st July); but it was not possible to contemplate waiting until these dates in 1964.39. They suggested two alternative broad approaches:  (i) Scheme &quot; A &quot;The Federal Government would continue to collect tax in terms ofits existing legislation but, by an agreement between all the govem-ments, would distribute that tax in full to the territorial governmentshaving regard to its known source of origin in the case of income tax and sundry revenues, and on an agreed estimated basis in the caseof customs and perhaps one or two other items. This would entailin practice returning to each territorial government its full revenues(though not its own taxing powers) with effect from the 1st July,1963. The Federal Government would then charge each territorialgovernment with the cost of providing services in its area togetherwith an agreed proportion of central and overhead expenditure,including public debt charges.(ii) Scheme &quot; B &quot;The transfer of taxing powers to the territories would take placeon an agreed date which would be as early as possible. As subjectswere taken back by the territories, the Federal Government wouldhand over either in a lump sum or in monthly instalments the money required to carry on the services at the level which had previously been determined by the Federal Government in its estimates. Incometax in respect of earnings of individuals and profits of companies to 31st March, 1963, should be credited to a special account as itaccrued being divided as to 62 per cent, to a Federal Account andthe remainder to the territories in the constitutional proportions. TheFederal account would have to be maintained on a trustee basis afterthe dissolution of Federation and would provide the money needed to continue Federal services up to the end of the tax year. thereafter the account might provide a surplus for distribution between theterritorial governments.40. The Conference appointed a sub-committee consisting of the seniorfinancial advisers of the delegations to consider these proposals.41. The sub-committee considered the two schemes, having regard tothe expressed wish of all delegations for speed and simplicity in the processof dissolution. The sub-committee felt that the division of revenue byterritorial sources and of expenditure by territorial incidence necessary under scheme &quot; A &quot; involved some intractable problems and that the process of reaching agreement and of negotiations would be unlikely to be completedwith maximum speed.42. On the recommendation of the sub-committee, the Conference agreedthat the attention of the post-Conference machinery should be directed toScheme &quot; B &quot;, as representing an outline of the procedures which mightbe appropriate to be followed in this matter.
Chapter VIIDEFENCE43. The Conference agreed that when the Federal Government ceased to exercise responsibility for defence the position in regard to the operational control of the forces should revert to that which obtained before 1953 whenSouthern Rhodesia was responsible for her own forces and the UnitedKingdom Government had operational control of the Forces in the northern territories. Thus, although the Federal forces would have to be partitionedbetween the three territories the actual task of partition would be madeeasier by the fact that it would initially simply be a question of transfer to two commands that of Southern Rhodesia and that of the UnitedKingdom Government in the Northern Territories.44. In most cases, the Conference envisaged units passing under thecontrol of either Southern Rhodesia or the United Kingdom accordingto their present dispositions, though there would be some agreed exceptions to this which would be announced as soon as possible. It was agreed thatarrangements would have to be worked out to permit members of theforces to declare in which territory they wished to serve in future.45. The physical assets of the forces would in general remain with theirpresent units, though the value of these assets would naturally fall to bedealt with in the context of the general arrangements for the apportionmentof Federal assets and liabilities. Obligations to members and formermembers of the forces would be dealt with on broadly similar lines tothose of members of the Federal Public Service.46. It was agreed that future consultation on these matters should be between the Governments concerned.Chapter VIIICITIZENSHIP47. The Conference agreed that when Federation was dissolved, Federalcitizens, being British subjects, ought not to lose that status. A separatecitizenship for each of the three territories would eventually be created bythe law of each territory, and the first necessity was for the governmentsof the territories to agree on a scheme under which a Federal citizenwould by law become a citizen of the territory to which he belonged. Itwould be the task of a committee of experts to draw up a scheme forthis purpose, for recommendation to governments. The committee should provide in suitable cases for giving an option, exercisable within a reasonable time, whereby a Federal citizen might choose the citizenship he would take;and for allowing in appropriate cases for double or even triple citizenship.48. Such a scheme having been drawn up and agreed, Southern rhodesia would pass a citizenship law to come into force on the dissolution of theFederation. In case there were difficulties over the two Northern territoriesdoing the same, the United Kingdom Government would consider makingthose Federal citizens, who would not become Southern Rhodesia citizens
t:ause they belonged to one or other of the Northern territories, citizens of: United Kingdom and Colonies, at least until those territories enactedtheir own citizenship laws. Any of these persons not wishing to becomecitizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies might be given an option todisclaim. The United Kingdom Government would in any case be respon-sible for the diplomatic protection of those persons who could properly be considered to belong to either of the two Northern territories, untilindependence.49. Other matters raised in connection with citizenship were passports,and free movement between the territories. It was agreed that the responsiblesuccessor governments should make arrangements for suitably endorsingpassports already held by Federal citizens, or for their re-issue, as seemedmost convenient. As to free movement, this matter would be of greatimportance to many individuals, and it should be considered by the appro-priate committee with a view to arriving at fair and satisfactory arrangements.50. The Federal delegation said that there might be Federal citizens who at the end of Federation would feel unable to return to their hometerritory, and asked what consideration should be given to their compensa-tion by the United Kingdom Government. In other cases Federal citizensmight be in need of protection in the territory to which they belonged,and this ought to be the duty of the United Kingdom Government. Thefurther point was made that free movement included the right of leaving a territory as well as that of entry.Chapter IX The FEDERAL SUPREME COURT51. The Conference noted that the Federal Supreme Court would cometo an end with the dissolution of the Federation. Accordingly the questioniof the scales of recompense for the judges might arise. It was agreedthat the question of a new Court of Appeal was a matter to be pursuedbetween territorial governments.Chapter XTIMETABLE52. The Conference agreed that in drawing up a timetable for the processes of dissolution it was necessary to strike a proper balance betweenthe need for speed and the orderly transfer of Federal functions to territorialresponsibility. It was obviously not possible for every consequence ofdissolution to be settled and new arrangements implemented within a matterof months, but there was general agreement that given the necessarywillingness and determination it should be possible to reach not later than the end of the year a stage at which the main range of Federalfunctions would have been, or would be in the position to be, transferred
to the territories, including the transfer of fiscal powers.   When that stsflpwas reached would appear to be the appropriate time at which the federal legislature and Executive could be brought to an end.53. The Conference agreed to set a target date of the 31st December,1963, for the dissolution of the Federation. This must be conditional onthe substantial settlement by that time of such important general issues as the apportionment of the public debt and other liabilities and assets andthe future of the Federal Public Service. All delegations agreed on theneed for the greatest degree of collaboration and effort.54. The various committees set up under the arrangements described in Chapter II of this Report would have to complete their work by aboutmid-September. At that time the governments concerned would be calledupon to reach final decisions on all questions arising out of dissolution,including decisions in principle on the areas of future collaboration. this process would have to be completed by about mid-October and would call for consultation between governments though not necessarily by meansof another formal conference. So far as possible all further processes of dissolution should be carried through at the working level.55. By mid-October the post-Conference machinery would need to have worked out for final agreement between governments the principles on whichthe apportionment of assets and liabilities should be carried through. Thisshould leave time for the final stage of the work of division of the assets and liabilities to be carried forward and completed between October and december.56. By about October the governments concerned would need to consult together about any transitional arrangements which might need to beintroduced on 31st December 1963, to deal with matters on which thedecisions reached between governments could not in practice be fullyimplemented by that date. The Conference agreed that until the post-Conference machinery had done its main work it would not be possible tosay exactly what issues might remain to be dealt with nor to suggest what might be the best method of dealing with them.57. Assuming that the decisions mentioned above were taken at the times stated, the United Kingdom Government should be in a position tocomplete and enact before the end of December 1963, the legal instrumentsnecessary to give effect to the decisions agreed upon by the governmentswho would be given an adequate opportunity of commenting on their proposed provisions.J.
