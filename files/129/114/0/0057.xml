Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1963C. (63) 157 Copy No.19th September, 1963CABINETHILL COW SUBSIDYMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodSome 36,000 holdings in the United Kingdom qualified for the hill cowsubsidy in 1962. This is a payment of  12 a year for each cow kept for breedingon land which comes within a definition set out in a statutory order made underthe Hill Farming Act, 1946. In England and Wales it is paid in 27 specifiedcounties on land satisfying the definition in Annex A.2. A number of anomalies have come to light in recent years in Englandand Wales which suggested that in some cases this subsidy was being paid tothose whose land should not be eligible. The Treasury pressed for an enquiry toremove these discrepancies and I agreed that there should be an investigation andreport by my professional advisers.3. I have now had the report, which recommends that the subsidy ought to be withdrawn, in whole or part, from some 1,700 farmers in 25 counties in thenorth and west of England and Wales nearly an eighth of those now getting it.The counties most affected are Devon, Northumberland, Cardigan and Monmouth(Annex B). In recent correspondence the Chief Secretary and I agreed that thereport should be implemented, but that to give the farmers affected some breathing space we would continue to pay them the subsidy in 1963 and 1964.4. The decision will undoubtedly mean a row with the local farmers&apos; unions in the counties affected, particularly the four mentioned above. A local review inCornwall in 1960 which affected only 80 farms was long and vigorously contestedand left a legacy of much bitterness. I shall be accused of withdrawing a worthwhilecontribution (averaging  120 a year) from farmers whose net income seldom,exceeds  1,000; who may have gone into livestock rearing because of the subsidyand may indeed find it exceedingly hard to make good this loss of income.5. The decision hangs on the interpretation of the definition of land eligiblefor the subsidy. The form of words set out in Annex A was undoubtedly intendedto confine the subsidy to the bona fide hill farmer with land that could be used only for breeding and rearing store cattle. Obviously the interpretation of thisdefinition involves an element of subjective judgment and the present proposals,,which will exclude land hitherto judged eligible, will be criticised on the groundthat:(a) the discrepancy with the previous classification is surprisingly large;(b) in particular whole areas are being excluded, notably in Devon andMonmouth, on a judgment that they are not areas of mountain, hillor heath within the intention of the legislation.6.   On the other hand, unpopular as they may be, the recommendations (a) represent the findings of my staff of qualified land surveyors;(b) have been endorsed by the County Agricultural Executive Committees,even in the counties most severely affected (though the DevonCommittee would like to see some compensating benefit substitutedif one could be devised); and3166
(c) are supported by the statutory Hill Farming Advisory Committee andprobably by many farmers in the more rugged hill land who resentsimilar benefits going to those with far easier conditions. Moreover,those in Cornwall and elsewhere, who have been declared ineligible inrecent years, would resent apparently more favourable treatment to\ these larger categories in other parts of the country and we might: even have to reinstate some of them.The recommendations cannot therefore be lightly set aside in view of myresponsibilities to administer the Act as Parliament intended it to be administered.7. In my view we should implement these recommendations. We shall,however, be taking away a worthwhile part of the incomes of these farmers andthere will be, at any rate in the districts mainly affected, resentment. I felt,therefore, that I should warn my colleagues before taking action on my decision.C. S.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S.W. 1,16th September, 1963.
