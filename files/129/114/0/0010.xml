Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1963C. (63) 110 Copy No.    5 92nd July, 1963CABINETCHARGE FOR SCHOOL MEALSMemorandum by the Minister of education on 8th February and again, after further consideration, on 28th June, I put amemorandum before the Home Affairs Committee proposing that the charge forthe school meal, which now stands at one shilling, should be increased to Is. 3d.The Committee were not agreed either on the advisability of making the change oron the date from which it should operate. It was, however, generally agreed that any increase would have to operate simultaneously throughout Great Britain and thatthe choice lay between introducing an increase in October and postponing itindefinitely. It was therefore decided that the matter should be referred to theCabinet.2. The charge for parents for school meals has stood at one shilling sinceApril 1957. I now propose that from 30th September, this being a more convenientdate for the schools than 1st October, the charge should be increased to Is. 3d.3. Since 1957 the gross cost of providing a meal has risen by approximately3d. from Is. lid. to 2s. 2d. During the same period the cost of living has increasedby 12f Per cent, and average earnings by 30 per cent.4. These figures by themselves surely justify the increase which I am proposing.It has always been our policy that we prefer to subsidise people in need rather thanspecific items of expenditure. I cannot see any obvious justification for allowingparents to receive, quite irrespective of their needs, automatic increases in a cashsubsidy at a time when real earnings have risen substantially.5. There is the further point that, since 1957, education expenditure by public authorities has risen by approximately one half, and the upward trend is still very strong. I should resist most strongly any proposals for curtailing expenditure whichI regarded as objectionable on educational grounds. But I believe it has become essential, in the interests of the educational service itself, to consider whether within this very large total of  1,150 million there are not certain items where a reduction could reasonably be made and I am convinced that this is just such an item.6. The net cost of the School Meals Service to the Exchequer is about  56million for 1963-64. It is difficult to estimate the saving involved. Earlier increases have resulted in a drop in the number taking the meal: we must expect the same thing to happen again. I would expect, however, a saving of the order of  6 millionrising to  7 million as the service is adjusted to a reduced level of output.7. There are no Parliamentary difficulties involved in the proposal in respectof the charge for the school dinner. An increase in the charge can be made by administrative action, though I would, of course, report it to the House.E. C. G.
