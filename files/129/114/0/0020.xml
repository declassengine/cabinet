i 4I JLconfidential(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)Sai63ll20 COPY NO.     dti9th. July, 1963CABINETFEILDEN REPORT ON ENGINEERING DESIGNM emj^andum^bjy, tJi^Js^y^^SLJ^i^SHJi-^SS^^iSProblemWe face a difficult situation created by the report of the Committeeon Engineering Design, under the chairmanship of Mr. G.E.R. Feilden.This was commissioned by the Council for Scientific and Industrial research in May, 1962, at the request of the Lord President.2.     The report has been fairly widely circulated in Whitehall.    It hasbeen printed for publication.    Ey an inadvertence it was mistakenlycirculated, for sale to the Stationery Office.    One copy was sold.    Theremainder have been retrieved.    It carries a letter from Sia&quot; Harold RoxbeeCo%, Chairman of the Council, to the Lord President which concludes:-&quot;. . . The Report of the Committee was received and discussed by the Council at their meeting on 13th June, 1963.   The Councilrecommended its publication. &quot;3.     The report offers some valuable findings and recommendations.    it also contains passages which are highly critical of the engineering industry,particularly in Chapters 1-4,    It prefaces its recommendations with anobservation likely to attract attention:&quot;       At the root of this problem lie the social attitudes of the citizens of this country which are in marked contrast to theattitudes of citizens of other industrially advanced countries. &quot;4.     The President of the Board of Trade is concerned by the likely effectof this report on the reputation of British engineering overseas and believes that its adverse comments will be seized upon with advantage by our foreign competitors.    These criticisms are pointed by the action of the Committee inattributing some of their sharper remarks to the witnesses who deliveredthem in evidence.    This raises a question of procedure which should perhaps be considered for the future.5.     The President of the Board of Trade has drawn attention to the passages which he considers will be used adversely.    They are certainlylikely to draw a spirited public retort from those sections of the industry towhom they are addressed.6.      The Lord President considers that publication of this report in fullshould be regarded as a matter of principle.    Apart from the obviousdangers of altering or suppressing passages in a report already widelycirculated, he considers that a duty lies on his office to publish studies ofthis kind sponsored by Research Councils.-1-
JL JL  jH^commendatiojig,7.     I now see no alternative to publishing this report as soon as possible and in full.    To alter or remove any of its passages, even with the agree-ment of the Committee and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,would, if exposed, lead to consequences far more damaging than publicationof the report in full.    Too many would be privy to such action and it wouldcertainly become known.    While not disputing the view of the President oftrie Board of Trade that some passages will be used as evidence against ourengineering industry, I am sure that discovery that the report had beenemasculated would be even more harmful,8,     Moreover, if the report is to have any value all its findings must becommunicated to those sections of the industry which are criticised.     to circulate these privately, while offering a milder version for sale to thepublic, would be an impossible exercise.    To withhold the substance of thereport from everyone in industry would clearly not be acceptable to itsavihors or the Council.9.     We are left, therefore, with the necessity of publishing the report and putting the best construction on our action.    This can be best done,not by an official statement in the House or elsewhere, but by agreeing aline which can be used as guidance by those Departments principally concerned.10.     I suggest this line might be:-(a) The views expressed by committees of this kind are not necessarilythose of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.    There are precedents forcommissioning and publishing repcrrts of this kind v/hich offer a criticaland independent view.    It is in line with the Beeching approach.(b) Those who feel they have been unfairly criticised will be free to answer the charges and v/ill no doubt do so.    Where any GovernmentDepartment such as the Ministry of Aviation considers particular criticismto be unjustified this information should be circulated and made part of theofficial brief for off the record guidance.(c) Reasonable retorts of this kind should not be carried to the length ofmaking it appear that different Departments are contradicting each other.A hint of such dualism v/ill greatly inflame subsequent controversy.(d) The Committee was clearly set up because we had reason to thinkthat design in British engineering had shortcomings.    The overriding need is to put them right as quickly as possible.     To suppress or muffle thereport would not achieve this.    Gn balance we consider that both here and overseas critics will be impressed by a determination to get to the root ofany weakness, even at the immediate cost of embarrassment.(e) Gur willingness to commission and circulate such candid criticismsmay be seen as an earnest of intention quickly to improve not merelytechnical shortcomings but fundamentally faulty social attitudes (seeParagraph 132) and these can only be corrected by public education.    Weconsider the report a basis for it.(f) While criticisms such as the Committee have delivered may wellbe used against us by competitors overseas, our engineering will ultimatelystand or fall by the quality of its products, not by the comments of its rivals.-2-
(g) We might add for good measure that if such reports on certain industries had been published earlier and acted upon such industries would now have a rosier future.(h) We should avoid appearing angry with the Committee or disturbed by the way it has done its work.    Some independent judges consider thereare touches of naivety in the report and a hint on these lines would do no harm.11.     I invite my colleagues to agree with these recommendations.V/, D.Office of the Minister without Portfolio, S. W. 1.9th July, 1963.
