Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1963C. (63) 144 Copy No.   5 930th July, 1963CABINETIMPORT POLICY FOR JUTE GOODSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland the President of the Board of Trade seeks authority, in C. (63) 143, to concludethe present negotiations with the jute industry on the basis set out in column 6 ofthe Annex to that paper. In the light of informal discussion which I have had withleaders of the industry in the last few days, I am bound to report my assessmentthat this course of action will lead to major political and economic difficulties forthe Government in Scotland.2. I do not take the view that the present system of protection for the juteindustry is sacrosanct, and I accept as I believe the industry does too that wemust move towards some concentration of the industry in those lines of production which can best be continued on a viable basis for at least the next 10 or 15 years,without needing measures of protection that conflict with our international obligations. I accept, too, that it is not enough simply to institute some form of inquiry while continuing the existing arrangements for protection for an indefinite period. But I am sure that immediate enforcement of the Presidents proposals would involve too sharp a break with the past to be tolerable at the present time,and might indeed undermine the prospects of achieving a viable, if smaller, juteindustry in and around Dundee.3. The industry is particularly concerned about the effect of introducing a fixed mark-up for &quot; equated &quot; goods, before an inquiry has identified the lines ofproduction on which the industry should concentrate and has examined the kindof continuing protection these would need. While the proposed 50 per centmark-up for the first year is almost exactly right at the moment, it may becometoo low or too high quite quickly; and the course of the present negotiationshas left the industry with a deep-rooted conviction that a uniform 20 per centmark-up over all classes of goods is the Governmenfs objective. Moreover, Iunderstand that the adoption of a 50 per cent mark-up for the excluded range ofgoods would raise prices in this category more than necessary; and, with any fixedmark-up, the problem of devising suitable means to counter identifiable unfair competition would still need to be solved.4. The Presidents proposals to return category 1 goods to private trade, andto reduce the mark-up on category 2 goods from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, will no doubt help with the Indians and will not cause major trouble in Scotland. ButI think that &quot; equated &quot; goods should continue for one year to be marked up onthe present basis, and that we should put in hand at once an inquiry into thefuture shape of a viable jute industry. The inquiry would be directed to reportwithin a year; and this direction would be supported by a statement now that, inthe event of no more satisfactory proposals emerging from the inquiry, a fixedmark-up of 45 per cent would be introduced after the year had run out. For this one year, too, there should be no further admission of excluded goods, althoughagain it would be announced that they would be admitted on a 45 per cent mark-up after the year had elapsed, in the absence of more satisfactory proposals from the inquiry. Also for this one year the quota for the admission of continental goods should be fixed at 1,000 tons without any explicit mention of subsequent increases.2909* fHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
5. It is an essential part of my proposals than an inquiry into the future c^Hthe jute industry should be set on foot immediately. I suggest that this should1,take the form of a Working Party, to be chaired by the Board of Trade, and made up for the most part of representatives of the Board of Trade and of both sides ofthe jute industry. Additional members would certainly include an economist andan -accountant, and there might be some advantage in the inclusion of one or morerepresentatives of some other industry. The Working Party should be given fairlyprecise terms of reference, calling upon it to study the pattern of a jute industry inDundee and district that had best prospects of economic viability for the next10 or 15 years, given measures of protection not incompatible with the country&apos;international obligations.6. I hope my colleagues will agree that these proposals will serve the sameultimate purpose as those put forward by the President; and that, under presentcircumstances, it is essential to avoid the serious political and economic consequencesthat the immediate enforcement of his proposals could involve.M. N.Scottish Office,29th July, 1963.
