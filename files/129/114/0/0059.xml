SECRET ,        24 g(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)-------&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;------gyC. (63) 159 COPY NO.,17th September, 1963CABINETFUTURE RELATIONS WITH SOUTHERN RHODESIAIN THE DEFENCE FIELDMemorandum, by the First Secretary of state the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia has on more than one occasion raised with me the question of our future relations in thedefence field.    More specifically he has asked whether Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment has an interest in Southern Rhodesia maintaining defencefox-ces at a level which would provide a contribution to Commonwealthdefence;  whether Her Majesty&apos;s Government would make a financial contribution for this purpose;  and whether the United Kingdom require a base in Southern Rhodesia.2.      The Annex to this paper contains a memorandum prepared in theCentral African Office in the light of consultations at official levelduring the past months with other departments concerned.    The conclusion reached is that negative replies will have to be returned to Mr. Field&apos;squestions and that this news should be conveyed to him before theforthcoming talks on the partition of the Federal Defence Forces whichare due to open in Salisbury on 23rd September.3.      I accept the validity of the arguments advanced in paragraphs 3and 4 of the Annex.    At the same time paragraph 5 makes it abundantly clear that action on the lines proposed would have a profound emotionaleffect in Southern Rhodesia which could seriously damage our future relations with her.    I would therefore welcome the opportunity of discussing this matter with my colleagues before any final decisions are taken.4.     I would myself like to envisage some contribution to Common-wealth defence from Southern Rhodesia, backed by a modest measureof financial assistance from the United Kingdom.   It would not, I think,be possible in advance of the general apportionment of Federal assets and liabilities to give any firm assurance in regard to financialassistance for this specific purpose.    I could, however, if my colleagues agreed, tell Mr. Field that if after the assets and liabilities of theFederation have been apportioned the question of financial aid to the territories by the United Kingdom were to arise, then we would haveregard to the contribution which the Southern Rhodesia Defence forces might make to Commonwealth defence.   (I would at the same time-1-
make it clear that while we would wish to negotiate over-flying andstaging facilities in Southern Rhodesia, we would have no requirement for a base there to replace our base in Kenya.)    This would admittedly not provide the Southern Rhodesia Government with a firmbasis on which to plan the size of their defence forces, but the doorwould at least remain open and the worst blow to Southern Rhodesiansusceptibilities would be avoided.R.A.B,Office of the First Secretary of State,King Charles Street,Whitehall, S. W. 1.17th September, 1963
? k n&amp; eJ uANNEXHER MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTjS.SVy^TjJR^REJLATIONS TjSf THEDEFENCE FIELD WITH SOUTHERN RHODESIAMr. Field&apos;s QuestionsDuring discussions with the First Secretary on 22nd March inLondon, and subsequently at Victoria Falls, Mr. Field asked thefollowing questions:-(a) Does the United Kingdom have any interest in SouthernRhodesia maintaining her defence forces at a level whichwould provide a contribution to Commonwealth defence ?(b) Would the United Kingdom contribute financially to enableSouthern Rhodesia to do this ?(c) Does the United Kingdom wish any &quot;base&quot; or similar facilities in Southern Rhodesia now that the Kenya basehas to be given up ?2.      These propositions were never put very clearly, and the records of the meetings indicate that Mr. Field is probably muddled in his ownmind as to precisely what he really wants e. g. he talks loosely of a&quot;base&quot; when all he may mean is logistical facilities.    The essence ofhis approach is that he realises Southern Rhodesia cannot afford tokeep forces on the scale he would like without some escternal financialassistance.    He would prefer to get this from the United Kingdom than from South Africa;  he may indeed have already been told by SouthAfrica that they cannot assist him in this way.    He hopes to keep theR. R. A. F. at its present level of 7 squadrons (costing  4 million ayear) and we believe he would like to expand the army from 2jr to3\ battalions.Objections to Complying with Mr. Field&apos;s Requests3.     Military Objections(a) The United Kingdom does not need any &quot;base&quot; in Central orSouthern Africa.    The Middle East Theatre Reserve now in Kenya iseventually to be redeployed afloat and in the Arabian Peninsula.Southern Rhodesia is too far away to be an acceptable location for anypart of this Reserve, and is in any case land-locked so that access alwaysdepends on the goodwill of other powers.(b) The Federation^ contribution to Commonwealth defence comprisedthe operational squadrons of the R. R. A. F. and their Special AirService Squadron.    These have never been an integral part of UnitedKingdom defence planning.    They were regarded as a &quot;bonus&quot; to our plans, i. e. though admittedly a useful addition to forces available inthe Middle East, we could manage without them.
(c) Within a year there will be a Central African Barrier of african states which can at will prevent the northward movement of southern rhodesian aircraft to the Middle East.    Thus the use of southern rhodesian forces for any operation will depend on the approval of theseAfrican states to the purposes of the operation.(d) The Defence Departments are unwilling to agree that theprovision of money for Southern Rhodesia forces should fall on theUnited Kingdom defence budget.    They would not agree to any reduction in United Kingdom forces to provide such money.4.     Political ObjectionsThe views of the Foreign Office and Commonwealth relations office have been taken and they consider that the United Kingdom&apos;interests would not be served by our accepting any close relationship with Southern Rhodesia in the defence field.    They would oppose any financial aid.    They are also strongly opposed to any deployment ofSouthern Rhodesian forces, elsewhere in Africa or in the Middle East.They point to the recent debate in the Security Council as evidence forthe inevitably serious damage that will be done to our relations with the afro-AsianJbloc if we assented to any of Mr. Field&apos;s propositions.    the would also be immediate repercussions for our relations with northern rhodesia and Nyasaland.     We have reason to believe that the attitude of elected Ministers in Northern Rhodesia to the Falls settlement wasinfluenced to some extent by the belief that Southern Rhodesia would notin fact be able to maintain the R. R. A. F. at its present level.The Other Side of the Picture5.      The Effect on Southern Rhodesia of a Negative ReplyThere is reason to believe that the senior officers of the FederalArmy and the R. R. A, F. are realistic about what can be expected fromthe United Kingdom.    Mr. Field and his Cabinet are however apparentlystill living in hopes that the United Kingdom will assist them in themilitary field, and a negative reply to Mr. Field&apos;s questions will be feltvery acutely by Southern Rhodesian ministers.    The emotional shockmight bring the independence issue to a head once more.    ManySouthern Rhodesians will feelthis was the final and conclusive evidencethat Her Majesty&apos;s Government was prepared to wash their hands ofSouthern Rhodesia because &quot;they like their black friends best&quot;.    Thedecisions will be linked with the current Security Council debate onGhana&apos;s resolution deploring Her Majesty&apos;s Government handing over the military forces, and it will be said that this is yet anotherreflection of British pusillanimity in the face of militant Africannationalism.    There will also be accusations that the Federal forces had been bixilt up to their present level with the encouragement of her majesty&apos;s Government, because of their Commonwealth contribution andthat we are therefox*e guilty of bad faithj  (we  are currently researchinginto the history to see how damaging this could be).    There may also bea tendency for Southern Rhodesia to look more to South Africa,particularly in military matters.    There is a remote risk that SouthernRhodesia, if sufficiently angered, might seek to place restrictions on the over-flying and staging facilities we require for the reinforcement of theHigh Commission Territories.-4-
6.      The September Defence MeetingThe defence meeting which opens in Salisbury on 23rd Septemberis to finalise the details of partitioning the Federal forces.    Thereis a real danger that unless Southern PJiodesia knows Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment^ answers to Mr. Field&apos;s questions in advance of thismeeting that her delegation may be unable to bid realistically for units,personnel, equipment etc. and that the meeting may run into theground over this difficulty.    If the Southern Rhodesians proved willingto participate constructively in the work of the meeting, despiteuncertainty about Her Majesty&apos;s Governments ultimate response totheir proposals, it would still be possible for the meeting to do useful work.    But if they came to the meeting on the basis that they did notyet know the size of their future forces, and refused to come to decisions while they remained in this state of uncertainty, the meeting might achieve very little.    The consequences of this would either bedelay in removing defence from the Federal Government, which coulddelay dissolution, or a partition of the forces without adequatepreparation, which would probably result in the units in the northern territories being ineffective for come time to come, thus necessitatingthe stationing of United Kingdom troops in the area, which we wish toavoid.7.      Thus, from the point of view of this meeting, which is anessential link in achieving an orderly partition of the forces before theend of the year, it is very desirable that Southern Rhodesia should begiven at least a very clear indication of the eventual answers, if notthe answers themselves, within the next 7-10 days.Summary8.      There appears to be no alternative but to give Mr. Fieldnegative answers to his questions in as kindly a way as possible sothat the minimum damage is done to our future political relations.The 23rd September meeting will be in some hazard unless this is done before it starts.    Furthermore if we attempt to run this meeting withoutthe reply being sent to Southern Rhodesia, we may very well subsequently be accused of bad faith, particularly if it transpires that SouthernRhodesia has bid for, and been allocated, forces which she cannotunaided possibly support.
