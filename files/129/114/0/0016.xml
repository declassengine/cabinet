confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1963C. (63) 116 Copy No.     6 08th July, 1963CABINETDISPOSAL OF CHALGROVE AIRFIELDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department the Home Affairs Committee have invited me to submit to the Cabinet theproblem, which they found themselves unable to resolve with unanimity, of thedisposal of Chalgrove Airfield. The airfield was built during the war on landrequisitioned from several owners and subsequently purchased. Since 1946, whenit ceased to be required for Service purposes, it has been used by the Martin-BakerAircraft Company Limited for testing aircraft ejector seats, of which they are the sole manufacturers in this country.History2.   The history of the problem of the airfield&apos;s disposal is briefly as follows:(i) In 1959 it was proposed (following the decision, after the Crichel Downcase, to dispose of surplus airfields) to sell Chalgrove to the Martin-Baker Company. Departure from the practice, adopted after crichel down, of offering land to the former owners was justified by referenceto the importance for defence purposes of the Company&apos;s work onejector seats. The former owners were consulted, and it appeared that only two were interested in buying their land back. One of these former owners made it clear, however, that he would be content if the Companyundertook to continue his existing facilities for farming parts of the airfield. It was decided that the sale should be subject to the Companyoffering the land back to previous owners when the Company ceased to use it. The Company&apos;s use was limited by the terms of their planning permission to the testing of ejector equipment.(ii) In a letter of 24th July, 1959, the Air Ministry offered to sell the airfieldto the Martin-Baker Company in return for assurances that(a) the Company had no intention of erecting a factory at Chalgroveand planned to continue to use the airfield for testing purposes;(b) if, when the Company&apos;s use of the airfield ceased, the Companydecided to dispose of the land, the former owners would be giventhe opportunity to buy back the land formerly belonging tothem; and(c) the existing agricultural occupancies would be continued.These assurances were given (in an exchange of letters set out at Annex).(iii) The then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Air saw the former owners and informed them that Mr. Martin, who controls theCompany &quot; had agreed that, in disposing of the airfield when he nolonger needed it for seat testing, he would give former owners the first opportunity to buy back the land formerly owned by them . . .&quot;.(iv) This assurance did not satisfy the local opposition, who pressed strongly that the airfield should either be returned forthwith to previous ownersor, at the most, should only be made available to the Company for acomparatively short period on a Government lease. The Companyhowever had made it clear from the outset of the negotiations that theywould not be content with any form of lease, because they did not wishto spend a substantial amount on improving the airfield without securityof tenure. The matter was therefore referred to the Home AffairsCommittee, who in January 1960 endorsed the decision to sell.2782
(v) In February 1960 the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Airstated in a letter to Mr. John Hay, in whose constituency Chalgrovelies, that &quot; planning permission . . . restricts the use of the airfield tothe flight testing of ejector seats &quot; and that &quot; we have asked Martin-Bakers to agree that if this need of the airfield for work on ejectionseats ceases they will give the former owners the first opportunity torepurchase their land. They have expressed their willingness to do this &quot;.(vi) Terms for the sale were agreed in March 1960, but completion was delayed by the statutory procedures for permanently closing certainold roads across the land and by discussions with the OxfordshireCounty Council about the provision of a substitute road. This issue was not resolved until the spring of 1963.(vii) In February 1963 pressure from local residents elicited from the Company&apos;ssolicitors a letter containing the following passage:&quot;... we have now heard from our clients that they have given noundertaking to the Air Ministry to resell the airfield to the former owners in the event of their ceasing to use it for testing purposes and further our clients have no intention of giving such anundertaking &quot;.(viii) In the face of this the Secretary of State for Air published, in reply to a parliamentary Question, the text of the letters at Annex. The objectorsobserved that the written undertaking given by the Company to offer the land back to the former owners when they &quot; decided to dispose of the land &quot; did not go so far as the Ministerial assurances, and therehas been increased pressure for either a tighter form of undertakingor the abandonment of the sale in favour of a lease. In April theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State informed Mr. John Hall thatthe sale would be deferred pending a review of the position by theMinisters concerned.(ix) The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Air has recently seen mr. Martin and has obtained from him an oral undertaking, which mr. Martin has agreed to confirm in writing, to offer the land back tothe former owners when the Company ceases to need it for testingejector seats.The present issue3. The question now at issue is whether to proceed with the sale to theMartin-Baker Company or to seek instead to negotiate a lease.Arguments in favour of proceeding with the sale4. The Secretary of State for Air, supported by some members of the HomeAffairs Committee, holds strongly that the airfield should now be sold to theCompany, because:(a) the negotiations with the Company extending over four years have committed the Government to a sale; they cannot withdraw withoutbreach of faith, and there is no reason to withdraw since Mr. Martin&apos;s most recent undertaking now fully meets the conditions upon which ministers originally decided in favour of a sale and coincides with theirpublic assurances;(b) the defence importance of not interrupting the Company&apos;s work is as great as ever and will continue well into the 1970s. This work is, for instance,essential to the development of the T.S.R.-2. Mr. Martin emphasisesthat he must have the security of the freehold before spending a furtheramount on improvements, which have already cost the Company 60,000. As recently as last May he has said that he will discontinuework on ejection seats if the offer to sell is withdrawn; and we cannotbe certain that he does not mean what he says.Arguments in favour of a lease5. The majority of the Home Affairs Committee think that a sale must be ruled out, because Mr. Martin&apos;s assurances are unenforceable at law and becauseafter his death (he is seventy-five) the Company might well be taken over by another
Home Office, S.W. 1,5 th July, 1963.ANNEXA.323089/59 24th July, 1959.Dear Mr. Martin,Chalgrove AirfieldI refer to your meeting with Mr. Taylor, Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Supply, and Mr. Airey Neave, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Air, on the 15th instant, and subject to confirmation from you that you are ableto give the various assurances referred to below, to inform you that a decision hasnow been made to place this airfield on offer for sale to your Company. If youaccept this I would suggest meeting you at an early date in order that terms can bediscussed. The sale would, of course, be subject to all existing planning consentsand existing tenancies.2. At the meeting referred to Ministers explained that some local feelinghad been aroused as a result of this proposal, and fears had been expressed thatthe Company might, at some future date, extend the present use of the property.On this you assured the Ministers that you had no intention of erecting a factory at Chalgrove and that your Company planned to continue to use the airfieldfor testing purposes as at present.3. You also stated that in the event of a sale to your Company, you would use your best endeavours to ensure that there was no unauthorised use of the airfield by trespassers another point to which Ministers&apos; attention had been drawn and you readily agreed to see that the main gate was kept locked andto take such other steps as might be necessary in order to achieve this object.4. As to the use of the airfield by Morris Motors Ltd., the sale to you wouldbe subject to this licence and we are getting into touch with this Company tomake it clear that testing should not take place on Saturdays, Sundays or public holidays, and on other days should only take place between the hours of 9 a.m.and 6 p.m. You stated that you would ensure that these conditions were observed.5. It was stated that certain owners had expressed an interest in repurchasingthe land formerly owned by them, and you will appreciate that the decision toplace the land on offer for sale to your Company means that the Air Ministryhas to disappoint those owners who would otherwise have been interested. Youwill also remember that the terms of the planning consent issued by theOxfordshire County Council and dated 24th July, 1958, specified that when theuse of this airfield by your Company or its subsidiaries ceased, buildings shouldbe removed, and the land left in a tidy and orderly state. If, at that date, yourCompany decided to dispose of the land, you assured Ministers that it wouldbe sold for agriculture. Additionally, Ministers would wish to be assured thatin the event of your selling the land for agriculture, the former owners would begiven the first opportunity to reacquire the land formerly owned by them ofcourse, subject to them being prepared to pay the market price at the time.company which would not honour them. It has been established that there is no way of incorporating in the sale enforceable conditions which would bind bothMr. Martin and his successors, and so guarantee that the Governmenfscommitments to the former owners will be honoured. A lease for twenty-one years with suitable breaks should give the Company sufficient security; some form ofcompensation for improvements might be negotiated with Mr. Martin; and onthe termination of the lease (which could be extended if defence needs justifiedit) the land could be offered back to the former owners.conclusion. I invite the Cabinet to decide whether disposal to the Martin-BakerCompany should be by way of sale or lease.H. B.
6. As regards Mr. Fleming, it is known that he would wish to continue inoccupation of the land on the airfield which he farms at present and you toldMinisters that you would want to continue this arrangement and foresaw nodifficulty in this or, indeed, in continuing the remaining agricultural occupancies.7. The decision to offer the property for sale to your Company has not yetbeen made known locally and until it is, I would ask that you should regard itas confidential. In the meantime, however, I should appreciate a letter from youconfirming the assurances which you gave to Ministers at the meeting on the15th instant, as set out in paragraphs 2-6 above, and accepting the additionalpoint contained in paragraph 5. If you can let me have this in the next day or so,I shall be most grateful.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)     C. E. R. HAYWARD,Chief Lands Officer.James Martin, Esq., C.B.E., M.I.Mech.E., F.R.As.S.,Messrs.
