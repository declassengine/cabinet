DRAFT COMMUNIQUEKENYA;  FUTURE CONSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENTMr. T. J. Mboya (Kenya Minister for Justice and ConstitutionalAffairs) has had talks with Mr. Duncan Sandys (the Colonial Secretary)about future constitutional development in Kenya.    Mr. Mboya hasbeen accompanied by Mr. J. Murumbi, Mr. M.P. Koinange andMr, C. Njonjo.2.     In the course of the discussions the Kenya Ministers outlined the progress made in working out the constitution for the proposedEast African Federation, which, would comprise Kenya, Tanganyika and uganda, and possibly also Zanzibar if it so wished.3.     Mr. Sandys once again assured the Kenya Ministers that theBritish Government, which has long believed in the idea of an east african Federation, supports fully the initiative taken by the east african Governments and will do all it can to facilitate the earlyimplementation of this aim.4.     It was agreed that it was desirable that Kenya should become independent shortly before the inauguration of the Federation, which itwas hoped would take place before the end of the year.    In thisconnection, the Kenya Ministers pointed out that, if the federal government wished to apply for membership of the United Nationsduring the next session of the General Assembly, their applicationwould have to be submitted by the third week in December.5.     In the light of these considerations Mr. Sandys agreed to convene a Conference towards the end of September, the purpose of which wouldbe to settle the final form of Kenya&apos;s constitution.    Having regard tothe date envisaged for the inauguration of the Federation, and subject tothe necessary steps being completed in time, Kenya would become independent on 12th December,6.     Representatives of the Government and Opposition parties inthe Legislature and of the European community will be invited to attend the Conference.   In order to facilitate the work of the Conference,preparatory discussions will be held in Nairobi.7.     It was agreed that the retention of a British military base in kenya after independence was not desired by either the British government or the Kenya Government.   It was recognised, however, that the orderly rundown of British forces after independence would inevitablytake time.    It was agreed that the withdrawal of these forces shouldbe effected over a period of up to twelve months from the date ofKenyaTs independence.    The question of the defence facilities which britain and Kenya might be able to offer each other after independence would be a matter for further discussion between the two Governments.Kenya Ministers undertook that, in the event of responsibility for defence matters being transferred to the Federation, such transferwould take place without prejudice to this agreement between theBritish and Kenya Governments,-1-
8.     It was recognised that, before the date of Kenyars independence,there would have to be discussions between the British Government andthe Government of Zanzibar about the future of the Coastal Strip.These discussions will be arranged as soon as practicable and, as previously agreed, the people of this area will be given the opportunityto make such representations as they may think fit through theGovernor of Kenya.9.     Kenya Ministers informed Mr. Sandys of talks which had takenplace in Nairobi with the Foreign Minister of the Somali Republic andof the intention of the Kenya Government to have further discussions.on behalf of the Kenya Governmenton behalf of the British Government-2-
