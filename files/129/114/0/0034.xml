Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1963C. (63) 134 Copy No.     5922nd July, 1963CABINETCENTRAL SCOTLAND AND THE NORTH-EAST OF ENGLANDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer this memorandum reports the progress in the Economic Policy Committeein considering the plans for regional Scotland and the North-East of England.2. We have given preliminary consideration to the plans themselves(E.A. (63) 24th Meeting, Minute 5). We remitted them to the Population andEmployment (Official) Committee to bring out the main issues requiring decisionsfrom Ministers at the first stage.3.   The views of the Official Committee were summed up as follows:(a) It is an important objective in the national economic interest to increaseemployment in the North-East of England and Central Scotland.(b) In order to do this effectively, it is necessary to have a planned development programme for these regions, on the general principles indicated inthe studies, embracing a concept of growth places, and a concentration of inducement to industry and articulated social investment.(c) To make substantial progress in these regions will at best be a formidabletask, sustained over a long period of years; and the Official Committeeadvised us strongly against making quantitative or timed commitmentsabout the growth of employment.(d) Much of the success of the programme will depend upon the extent towhich it is practicable to discriminate in favour of these regions, bothin the inducements to industry and in social investment. A strong casecan be made to justify discrimination, at any rate for an initial period.(e) The concept of &quot; growth places &quot; appears to us to be appropriate for these regions and to be applied cautiously in the proposals, although it may give rise to local controversy and pressures.(/) Further consideration is needed to establish how far the essential requirements of the two development programmes for financialinducements for industry could be met without amendment of the local employment Acts. It would be impracticable to recast the whole structure of those Acts quickly.(g) There should be articulated social investment programmes concentrated onfocal points, and arrangements should be made for Ministers to considerthe scale and timing of these programmes in relation to othergovernmental programmes.(h) There should be a review of the possibilities of expanding the capacity ofthe construction industries in these regions.2855
4. The Economic Policy Committee agreed generally with these recommendations and took the following specific decisions:(i) We should prepare to make announcements on sets of proposals for the planned development of Central Scotland and the North-East ofEngland by the end of October. There would be separate announcementsfor each region. The proposals would not say specifically how many jobsit was intended to create or how many people it was envisaged would leave the regions, or give any precise statement of the time scale for achieving particular objectives.(ii) Priority should be given to the two regions (we shall consider further theextent of this).(iii) The basis of the planned development in the two regions should be the concept of &quot; growth places &quot;.(iv) The Population and Employment (Official) Committee should preparefurther memoranda on(a) the question whether amendment of the Local Employment Acts willbe required in due course;(b) the scale and timing of the public service investment programmes;(c) an outline of White Papers relating to Central Scotland and to theNorth-East of England.5. The Economic Policy Committee envisaged that, if it is so desired, anannouncement could be made before the Recess indicating that the governmenth oped to publish proposals by the end of October. In the meantime, if particularprojects relating to Central Scotland or the North-East of England would otherwise be ready for announcement, they should not be held up until the White Papers are published, and, generally, we should take any suitable opportunity to refer to what has already been done to benefit these regions.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,22nd July, 1963.
