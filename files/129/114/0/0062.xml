C.J^3jj62ra COPY NO.      1.2.0th September, 1963CABINETBUSSS^ J^R^CUBA.memorandum I by the Minister of State, Board of TradeI.,eylands have appalled to the Export Credits guarantee department for cover for the supply of 450 buses worth  3. 2 million to Cuba on 5-year credit terms.2.     In November 1961, it was decided that cover for Cuban businessshould only be given where payment was to be made by shipment.    TheEeylaad application is the first to be received since then for longerterms.    In the light of current information about Cuba&apos;s convertiblecurrency earnings and their experience of Cuban repayments undercontracts already guaranteed before November 1961, the Departmentconsider the risk to be acceptable.    The export arguments in favourof this business are very strong but the Foreign Secretary has asked that it should be considered by the Cabinet before a decision is taken.3.      The President is in favour of allowing the application for thefollowing principal reasons:(a) There is no economic reason why we should treat Cuba lessfavourably in terms of Export Credit Guarantee Department coverthan some other South American countries;  her balance of payments,prospects are no worse than those where we do allow a degree of cover.Her annual earnings of convertible currency are estimated at about 65 million which is large both in relation to the instalments whichwould be due under the Leyland contract and to her trading debts onwhich repayments are being made.(b) If, as has been suggested, we insist on cash terms, we shalllose the business.    Buses are normally exported on 3 to 5-year creditterms - they are agreed within the Berne Union to be suitable generally -and the Cubans can expect to get these terms, which are essential forthem, from Beyland&apos;s competitors in Eastern Europe.    The Hungariansare known to be active.    Beylands have reported German, French,Japanese and Spanish interest also.(c) Our declared policy is to conduct our trade with communist countries, save for strategic considerations, on a commercial basis.We do not discriminate against Communist countries in givingcommercial credit and we provide normal credit cover for business with Russia and most of the Sino-Soviet bloc countries.    The criterionis their creditworthiness.   It would be inconsistent to import adifferent principle in relation to our trade with Cuba.-1-
(d) Ley-lands have an outstanding record and reputation asexporters and they deserve all the support we can give them.    BeforeCastro they were successful in breaking into the Cuban market wherethe United States previously held a monopoly.   Approval of their application would enable them to reap the reward of their pastefforts which otherwise will be denied to them.    They have an excellent opportunity of getting back as the Cubans are reported tobe dissatisfied with their Eastern European suppliers, but if theymiss this opportunity they are unlikely to get a second chance.(e) Not only is this contract valuable in itself;  it carries with it the certain prospect of further orders in spares to a value roughlyequal to the original contract price.(f) The fear that by covering this contract, we shall incurUnited States displeasure cannot be regarded as overriding.    TheUnited States are well aware that it is not Her Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s policy to discriminate against particular Communist countries in normal commercial business.    We should stand firmly on this.4.      There is immediate urgency in taking a decision if the contractis not to be lost.     The Cabinet are invited to agree that theapplication should be approved.A. G.Board of Trade, S. W. 1.20th September, 1963
