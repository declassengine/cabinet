Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1963C. (63) 119 Copy No.9th July, 1963CABINETNUBIAN MONUMENTSMemorandum by the Minister of education in March 1960, in response to pleas by the Governments of the U.A.R. andthe Sudan, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and&quot; Cultural Organisation(UNESCO) launched an international appeal for funds to save the monuments ofNubia which will be submerged by 1964 as a result of the construction of theHigh Dam. The United Kingdom&apos;s contribution to two of the main aims hasconsisted of Treasury grants, up to a maximum of  45,000, to the Egypt ExplorationSociety for British participation in the work of rapidly investigating unexploredarchaeological sites in Nubia and of transferring temples which can be moved tosafe sites.2. A third aim has been to preserve some monuments in situ. The mostfamous are the temples of Abu Simbel, and much publicity has surrounded theefforts to save them. The first proposal adopted was an Italian scheme, estimated to cost $70 million, to raise the temples whole above the eventual level of the Nile.The project was planned in two stages the first being the lifting operation andthe second restoring the landscape. The Cabinet considered at its meeting on 9th November, 1961, (C.C. (61) 61st Conclusions) whether the United kingdom should contribute to the cost of this scheme and came provisionally to theconclusion that a contribution would not then be justified. (At that time there wasno indication that either the USSR or the United States intended to subscribe.)3. The Italian scheme remained the most favoured until the 12th general conference of UNESCO in December of last year. By the autumn of 1962 it had become clear that the money, even for the first stage, would not be found fromvoluntary contributions. The conference therefore had before it a proposal to finance the first stage of the scheme from loan and make the repayments a charge on UNESCO&apos;s general budget over a period of 15 years. The total cost, includinginterest, would have been some $42 million. This compulsory plan was defeatedby a decisive majority of votes.4. The conference agreed, however, that the appeal fund should be continued,and the Executive Committee of the Campaign, together with the Government ofthe U.A.R., have been considering alternative proposals. It has now been formallydecided to adopt a Swedish scheme, estimated to cost up to $36 million ($32 millionplus $4 million for contingencies) to cut the monuments into sections and liftthem piece by piece to be reassembled in a new and higher position. A major factor in the decision was the known willingness of the United States Government,now confirmed, to contribute a third of the cost ($12 million) from blocked funds in Egypt. More than $19 million have already been pledged from other sources,including $11^ million from the U.A.R. Among the other major contributors areGermany, approximately $1,845,000; Italy, $1,800,000; France, $1,000,000;Netherlands, $533,000; Spain, $270,000; Japan, $1,000,000.* The amount remainingto be found towards the basic sum of $32 million (at which point the U.A.R.* Several of these countries in particular the United States, Germany and Italy have alsocontributed substantial sums for other monuments under the campaign. The United Statescontributed $5 million alone for preserving the temples at Philae.2787
Government will be willing to sign contracts) is about $J million. The chief reasonadvanced by my predecessor for not contributing to this part of the campaign atan earlier stage was that if large sums of extra money could be found for UNESCOthey should be devoted to the urgent educational needs of Africa. I fully agreed with this argument and have continued to act upon it. Nevertheless there are new factors in the present situation which make it necessary for us to look afresh at thecase for a United Kingdom contribution.5. It has been represented to me again, by the Director-General of UNESCO,that if we do not contribute to the appeal we shall be the only country with a major interest in archaeology, and particularly an outstanding reputation in thefield of Egyptology, to remain out of the picture. Apart from this argument, whichcounted with some of my colleagues when the matter was last discussed, thesituation is now different from what it was in 1961 in that the sum of money still to be found is now marginal compared with the total cost, so that even acomparatively modest contribution by the United Kingdom would have an appreciable effect in helping to fill the gap. If Her Majesty&apos;s Government stilldecline to contribute we shall be very much isolated, and are likely to arousesuspicions with the United Arab Republic that our attitude is basically one of hostility. Moreover, we shall encounter severe criticism in this country not least in Parliament where members of all parties have been pressing me on this matter.I think these arguments carry weight, and that there is now a strong case for a united Kingdom contribution.6. In 1960 the Foreign Secretary, who favoured a United kingdom contribution for political reasons, recommended a sum of  50,000. If a UnitedKingdom contribution was to be effective as an example to other countries, andearn credit with the member States of UNESCO, I should be inclined to favour a somewhat larger sum (which could be pledged now but need not be paid untilthe next financial year). I recommend that we should subscribe $250,000 (just under  90,000).E. C. G. B.Ministry of Education, W. 1,8th July, 1963.
