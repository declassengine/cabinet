PROFUMCS RESIGNATIONNote by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I circulate the revised draft statement attached for consideration by the cabinet at their meeting tomorrow.(Signed)        EURKE trend cabinet Office, S. W. 1.7,0th June, 1963
DRAFT STATEMENTSince the Debate on Monday, I have considered, as promised by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House, the form of afurther enquiry into the security implications of the events leading to Mr. Frofumo&apos;s resignation.    I think it is generally agreed thatthere should be an investigation in the light of this case into theoperation of the Security Service and their relationship with the police in connection with matters of national security.   The Government intend to establish an enquiry for this purpose.    But before I describe itthere are certain other questions which I must now bring to the attentionof the House.It will be within the knowledge of many hon. Members thatarising largely out of the recent episode, rumours are circulatingwhich affect the honour and integrity of public life in this country and,if they were true, might point to a security risk.    Such a situationcannot be tolerated.    I have therefore decided that the public interestrequires us to establish an enquiry covering the security aspect notonly of the recent case but also of other allegations of the type whichI have mentioned.Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, has agreed to conductthis enquiry and to render his report to me as soon as possible.    Histerms of reference will be as follows to examine, in the light of the circumstances leading tothe resignation of the former Secretary of State for War,Mr. J. D. Profumo, the operation of the Security Serviceand the adequacy of their co-operation with the Police inmatters of security; to investigate any information or material which may come to his attention in this connection and toconsider any evidence there may be for believing that national security has been, or may be, endangered? andto report thereon.In the course of the discussion with the Leader of the OppositionI have explained to him the reasons for which the Government believes that in the circumstances with which we are now confronted this enquiry should be of a judicial character and should cover a wider field.
