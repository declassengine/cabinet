Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1963C. (63) 126 Copy No.16th July, 1963CABINETTHE CHARGE FOR SCHOOL MEALSRemission ArrangementsMemorandum by the Minister of Education and the Secretary of Statefor ScotlandOur colleagues invited us to circulate a note indicating how local authorities at present exercise their discretion to remit the charge for the school dinner and what might be the effect of the introduction of a uniform remission scale(C.C. (63) 44th Conclusions, Minute 7). The position in England and Wales is described first because it is there that it is proposed to introduce the new remissionscale.2. Prior to 1956 local education authorities in England and Wales wereenabled by regulation to meet the dinner charge in whole or in part in respect ofany family for whom the payment of the charge would have been a hardship.But in that year, to iron out the disparities between their remission scales, their arrangements were made subject to the approval of the Minister of Education.In the scales subsequently approved by the Minister 100 authorities included a discretionary clause permitting them to grant free meals, or meals at part costin exceptional cases of hardship not otherwise covered by their schemes (e.g., wherethe standard of living of the family is suddenly and drastically reduced throughloss of income or the imposition of some new burden). Most discretionary cases are subject to the decision of the Local Education Committee and are reviewed at intervals. It is mainly the families struck off the free list at these periodic reviews,e.g., because of an increase in National Assistance, who come to the notice ofMembers of Parliament and the public.3. Over the last six years the number of free meals, including the special casesgranted by authorities, has been as follows:Number of Cost to ExchequerFree Meals (at Is.)Financial Year            (million)   (million)1957-58      .........      42-3 2-11958-59      .........      45-2 2-21959-60      .........      50-2 2-51960-61      .........      47-0 2-31961-62      .........      46-5 2-31962-63      .........      50-3 2-54. There still remain in England and Wales considerable disparities betweenauthorities&apos; scales and the Minister of Education early this year obtained theagreement of the Treasury to introduce a national remission scale based on national assistance rates. The new scale concedes free school dinners automatically to a family in receipt of National Assistance, and it includes a simple provision to shield2822
the low wage earner with the large family whose income after rent has been paid isonly marginally above the National Assistance scale rates by raising the qualifyingincome level proportionately to the number of children.5. The effect of the new scale would be to level up all the approved remissionscales in England and Wales on the basis of the National Assistance scale ratesintroduced in May. A higher national scale will prima facie entitle additional familiesto free dinners in a number of areas where the scales are still low but it is likely that most of these are already in practice catered for through the application of thediscretionary clause.6. The intention of the Minister of Education would be to introduce the new scale administratively in England and Wales with effect from the autumn term,using his powers under the 1959 Milk and Meals Regulations to ensure complianceby all authorities. The timing of the introduction of the new national scale need not depend on any decision taken about the dinner charge either in England and Walesor in Scotland. Even if the question of the increased charge or the date of imposingit is deferred, the autumn term would be a suitable date for the introduction of thenew remission scale in England and Wales.Scotland7. The Meals Service (Scotland) Regulations, 1953, require each educationauthority to have an approved scheme setting out the charges for mid-day meals.The schemes not only have to include power to remit the whole of the charge in casesof financial hardship, but may specify reduced charges for:(a) other than the first pupil in the family;(b) pupils at special and nursery schools; and(c) families with incomes only marginally above the hardship level.8. For the guidance of authorities a model scheme has been in existence,with scales based on the National Assistance (Determination of Need) Regulations.About half the authorities in Scotland use the model scheme; nearly half use ascheme slightly less generous; and four (including Glasgow) use a more generousscheme. Although the basic scales thus differ, the schemes have operatedsatisfactorily and without giving rise to real complaint. On the face of things,there is scope for rationalisation to bring more schemes exactly into line with the model and into automatic relationship, as now proposed for England, with theNational Assistance scales. But any advantage in doing so is likely to beoutweighed by, in particular, Giasgow&apos;s objections to coming into line. The higher proportion of free meals they serve is due mainly to a clause enabling a largeramount of excess income (up to 10s.) to be disregarded in marginal cases.Generally speaking, however, in Scotland as a whole full remission is given to children from families with incomes at about the National Assistance Board&apos;slevel of need; and partial remission for children of large families. Thus the schemesall take account of the needy and the large families and there is no clamant needfor revising them, though there is scope for some tidying up. To interfere withGlasgow&apos;s scheme, approved after discussions by the then Secretary of State forScotland in 1956, would cause resentment.9. There would be no embarrassment in Scotland if a national scale on itsown were to be introduced in England and Wales. However, if the proposal isto be presented in England and Wales as some compensation for the increasedcharge this offsetting factor will not apply in Scotland because, as explained,schemes there are working satisfactorily from the consumers&apos; point of view andwithout complaint. There seems indeed no way of offsetting the impact of anincreased charge in Scotland where the impact will in any case be severe (thetwo previous increases each having resulted in over 40,000 fewer children takingthe meal a 15 per cent drop from which,it took 2-3 years to recover).M.
