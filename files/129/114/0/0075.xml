Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1963C. (63) 175 Copy No.       611st October, 1963CABINETTHE ROBBINS report memorandum by the First Secretary of state at their meeting on 26th September the Education Policy Committee had before them a memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general containing proposals for the contents of a statement of Government policy on the recommendations of the Report, and a memorandum by the Minister ofEducation about the Robbins Committee recommendation on the creation of a council for national academic awards.2. The Committee considered that while many of the recommendations contained in the Report would require further consideration in the light of the opinions expressed by those concerned after the publication of the Report, it was important that a statement of Government policy should be made early in the new session on a number of matters, including in particular those with respect to the government&apos;s intentions on the Committee&apos;s recommendations for the expansionof the Universities in the periods up to 1967-68 and 1973-74.3. The Committee agreed that subject to the approval of the Cabinet such astatement should include decisions on the 16 matters set out in paragraphs 2-17inclusive of the Annex to this paper.R. A. B.Office of the First Secretary of State, S.W. 1,1st October, 1963.AnnexOUTLINE OF GOVERNMENT STATEMENT1. The Government welcome the Robbins Report; commend its academicrecommendations to the educational world; and accept the challenge which it represents.2. Accept the basic assumption of the Report &quot;that courses of higher education should be available for all those who are qualified by ability andattainment to pursue them, and who wish to do so &quot;.Expansion programme. Government accept the Report&apos;s calculations of the requirements of places, both in total higher education and in institutions of university status, andaccept them as objectives for 1967-68 and 1973-74, and will make plans and provide resources accordingly.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT3229
4. In order to meet the rapidly growing number of qualified students as the&quot; bulge &quot; reaches its peak, the Government will seek to accelerate the expansionof the next few years, with the objective of 197,000 places of &quot; university status &quot;by 1967-68: current and capital grants will be adjusted in accordance with this&quot; emergency &quot; objective: University Grants Committee and Education Departments?have been asked to explore the possibilities with the institutions.*J 5. This is the first step in formulating a 10-year programme designed toprovide 390,000 places by 1973-74, of which 217,000 in institutions of &quot; universitystatus &quot;.6. This programme will take account of the need for further considerable expansion after 1973-74, but it would be premature (and recognised to be so inthe Report) to try to decide the scale now.7. Cost of 10-year programme estimated at  3,500 million, involving morethan doubling present annual cost by 1973-74. Very important to get most economical use and value for money on resources devoted to higher education.8. Also very important to keep this programme in proper relationship withthe development of school and technical education. In the immediate period inwhich the &quot; bulge &quot; is reaching university age, the provision of an adequate numberof places is of particular urgency.Development of Institutions9. Accept in principle proposal of &quot; university status &quot; for Colleges of advanced Technology (CATs), and certain Scottish central institutions; and preliminary action will be initiated at once. Promotion of other institutions willbe considered later.10. Accept proposal for Council for National Academic Awards to awarddegrees to students in non-university institutions.11. Government will await public discussion before deciding future of teacher training colleges.12. reports proposals for new institutions will be considered when the10-year programme is being formulated by the University Grants Committee(UGC) and Education Departments. Government have asked UGC for an earlyreport on the recommendation for a new university to be located in Scotland.13. Government welcome emphasis on building up technological universities,and has asked UGC for an early report on the further development of ImperialCollege and the Glasgow and Manchester Colleges of Science and Technology, andon the proposal for a completely new technological university. The Government willgive consideration to the proposal to develop one of the CATs.14.   Government welcome emphasis on management studies.Machinery of Government15. Government agree that the autonomous institutions should draw theGovernment^ financial support from an independent Grants Commission, on similar lines to the UGC.16. Government will make full review of the system of higher education (andstudent) finance in the light of the considerations put forward in the Report.17. Government agree on the need for changes in machinery of government,which will involve legislation, but Government will not decide this in advance ofpublic discussion. This will not delay action on the expansion programme, on whichthe Departments concerned and the UGC are working as one team.
