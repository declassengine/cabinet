Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1963C. (63) 133 Copy No.22nd July, 1963. CABINETTHE AIRCRAFT CARRIER REPLACEMENT programme memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general in C. (63) 132 the Chancellor of the Exchequer puts the carrier problem in the wider context of our mounting Defence expenditure and the overriding need to check the growth of public expenditure generally. In this paper I propose toexamine in more detail the arguments for and against the carrier replacementprogramme itself. Before doing so, I should like to emphasise how crucial thedecision on this problem will be for our Defence expenditure, and therefore forour economy, as a whole. It is clear from the discussions in the Defence Committeethat for the long-term a decision on the carrier programme alone offers thepossibility of a reduction in expenditure sufficiently large to contain the defence budget within something like tolerable bounds. This surely means that before thecase for replacement can possibly be accepted, it is incumbent on those whoadvocate the vast expenditure involved to demonstrate beyond all doubt that afleet of four vulnerable carriers will, in the situation which we shall face in thelate 1970s and in the light of the probable development of weapons, be vital andnot simply desirable to the defence interests of this country assessed, as theymust be, with the greatest possible realism. Arguments which, however persuasive,do not in themselves demonstrate this must not, in my view, be accepted. Andalthough the Minister of Defence says that the case for and against carriershas been exhaustively argued over the years, it has not been discussedinterdepartmentally nor presented in any detail to the Defence Committee, have not myself seen any full analysis. It is against this background that I would ask my colleagues to consider the arguments in this paper and the Minister ofDefence&apos;s paper C. (63) 128.2. The Cabinet must not be in any doubt about the probable cost of carrierreplacement. The full four ship programme is likely to involve capital expenditureof the order of  700 million over the next 14 years and recurrent expenditurebuilding up to some  85- 90 million a year towards the end of that period. Detailsof this estimated expenditure are set out in the Annex to this Memorandum.And estimates of this kind are invariably too low.3. I recognise that the Minister of Defence asks only for a formal decisionto replace one carrier. He has also offered to postpone the replacement of thethird and fourth carriers. But I think my colleagues will appreciate that, once wehave decided to replace the first ship, in practice we shall be under great pressure to replace all four. The fact that the R.A.F. had had to forgo the new tacticalaircraft they would have chosen for their own purposes (for the sake of havingone which would meet naval needs as well) would in itself be a powerful argument for not stopping the carrier replacement programme half way. In any case, the savings offered from deferring the second pair of replacements would, even ifrealised, give no appreciable financial relief until the next decade.4. The Minister of Defence also offers savings put at some  150 million onthe basis of a fleet of four carriers through developing one common aircraft to succeed the Royal Navy&apos;s Sea Vixen and the R.A.F.&apos;s Hunter. Any estimate ofsuch savings must be highly speculative since it rests not only on some fairlyTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT2865
arbitrary assumptions about costs, but also on the untested hypothesis that it would turn out to be practicable to develop a common version of the P. 1154 withoutunacceptable degradation of performance and undue retardation of delivery. Theresults of the aircraft feasibility study-the initial paper analysis will not beavailable before the end of August.5. Even if the feasibility study were to produce apparently acceptable results(and it would not surprise me if it did) on the performance of the aircraft, however,the case for new carriers would be far from being established. The present carrierswill go on into the 1970s, and some of them could indeed be stretched until 1980.The earliest of the new ships would not enter service until the latter part of 1971.Are we sufficiently sure that in the 1970s strategic thinking will regard carriers asso important as to justify us now in committing so large a part of our potentialdefence effort to this weapon?6. It appears to be generally accepted that the prospective role of the carrierwould be restricted to limited war only, and the question therefore arises of whetherso expensive a weapons system is required for a limited war role, on top of our other war potentialities. Here it is relevant to point out that it has been accepted that by 1970 we should not undertake by ourselves to mount assault operations against entrenched opposition and that any operation of this kind would beundertaken, if at all, as part of allied campaigns. I should also like to make thefollowing comments on certain aspects of the Ministers paper:(a) MobilityThe Minister argues that the mobility of carriers would enable us to deploy tactical airpower wherever we wish. As, however, he envisages that only two, or at least three, carriers would be operational at any one time, i venture to doubt whether in practice we should find that we had a carrier inthe right place at the right time.(b) VulnerabilityI have seen no analysis of this problem and the annex to the Ministerspaper is silent about it. But I have grave doubts as to whether it will, giventhe probable development of other weapon systems by the middle 1970s,be sensible to pack so much costly striking power with so much vulnerableaviation fuel and explosives into a single ship.(c) MissilesParagraph 2 of the annex to C. (63) 128 suggests that, if the Navy wereto have no fixed-wing aircraft, an &quot; all-missile Navy &quot; would be necessary. ButI am doubtful whether, even on the Minister of Defence&apos;s assumptions, weshall escape a demand for new and highly sophisticated weapon systems not now in the programme, since I cannot see how a carrier fleet equipped only with the P-1154 basically an interceptor aircraft could fulfil all thefunctions which have been enumerated. It would seem that the P-1154 wouldhave to be an entirely different aircraft from that now envisaged, or thatcarriers would have to embark additional aircraft of a different type, or thatsome surface-to-surface missiles would be required.7. It has been stated e.g., in paragraph 5 of the Minister of Defence&apos;s paper of 2nd July to Defence Committee on future defence policy (D. (63) 23)-that if we abandoned the carriers the Navy would be virtually dissolved unless weincurred very heavy alternative expenditure on reprovisioning. This is plainnonsense. A fleet without carriers was one of the alternative possibilities envisaged in studies made two years ago. It was still very substantial and this was, of course,before Polaris submarines had been added at a cost of some  500 million overthe next 10 years. In the past two years the Navy&apos;s demand for manpower has risen from this and other causes by 8,000 to 96,000. Even without the carriers, orany new weapons thought up to be a substitute for them, the construction programme for warships in the 1970s would run at about  90 million a year (atpresent prices). The fleet would have a manpower of some 80,000 and wouldhave some 130 ships in the operational fleet. It would, of course, include fourPolaris submarines, the most powerful weapon of all. The Navy estimates, atpresent prices and on the basis of present forecasts (which all experience shows
are likely to be too low), would be about  450 million. I suggest that we shall inany case have a powerful non-carrier naval capability which together with a long-range land-based air reconnaissance and strike at both high and low level wouldgive us a formidable armoury.conclusion. Quite apart from the general considerations developed by the chancellor in his paper, I do not consider that on its own merits a case has yet beenestablished for deciding to embark on the construction of new aircraft carriers,and I suggest that the sensible decision is to abandon the idea of replacing ourpresent carriers when they or existing types of carrier aircraft cease to be thought of value.J.

The above estimates of capital and recurrent expenditure were based on the assumptionthat a special naval version of the P-1154 would be developed, but did not include any allowance for Ministry of Aviation research and development on the naval version (some  90 million). On theother hand they take no account of the possible  150 million savings arising out of the commonaircraft envisaged in the Minister of Defence&apos;s paper (C. (63) 128). In D. (63) 23, the phasing of suchsavings over the next 10 years was quoted as:1965- 1966- 1967-   1968- 1969-    1970-    1971-    1972-   1973-66 6 7      68        69 70 71         72        73       74        total production forRoyal navy and   R.A.F.   +0-5 +0-5    -     -4-5 -18-5   -38-3   -43-9   -24-1   -0-2   -128-5Ministry ofAviationresearch anddevelopment   -2-0   -4 0   -4-0   -8-0   - 7 0   - 4-0   + 1-0   + 2-0   +1-0   - 25 0Whether it would be practicable to achieve savings of this order depends on the outcome of the feasibility study.
