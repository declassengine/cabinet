Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1963C. (63) 167 Copy No.      6 430th September, 1963CABINETRATESMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh AffairsWe need to decide urgently what line we are going to take on rates. The reportof the Committee under Professor Allen cannot be expected until early next summer. But if any legislation is to affect the rate bills which householders will receive next April, it must be introduced before Christmas in order that localauthorities may take account of the changes when framing their budgets during january and February of next year. I have had discussions with the Chief secretary and this paper is the outcome of our talk.2. Until we have the results of the Committee&apos;s researches into the impact ofrates we shall not have the information necessary for a proper appreciation of whatneeds to be done. Besides, the fact that we have appointed a committee to study the impact of rates on householders means that we could not introduce anythoroughgoing changes before receiving the report without exposing ourselves tothe charge that it was a waste of time.3. There are, therefore, as I see things, only two courses open to us. The first is to stand firm and to say that we will do nothing in advance of the report of theCommittee, which would mean no legislation during the lifetime of the present parliament. The second is to bring forward interim proposals designed to hold the fort until the report is ready and there has been time to digest it.4. There has undoubtedly been a drop in the temperature this last month ortwo so far as rates are concerned; the revenue is coming in as well as usual, andappeals against the new assessments are fewer than had been expected. No doubtmany of the complainants have become reconciled to their new assessments. but when next year&apos;s bills come out, showing the inevitable increase of something like5-7 per cent in what the average householder has to pay, this is bound to reopenold wounds. I have therefore been considering what might be done to take someof the sting out of next year&apos;s rate increases.5. To attempt to pin next year&apos;s rates generally at their present level wouldbe prohibitively expensive it might cost as much as  100 million as well assetting a disastrous precedent. It would also mean giving additional Exchequerassistance indiscriminately to lightly rated areas as well as to those where theburden is heavy. Despite the steady growth of local expenditure it is probablystill true to say that it is the distribution of the rate burden among householdersrather than the size of their total contribution which is the main cause of complaint.(In over half of the country the average householder still pays less than 10s. a week in rates.) A large proportion of the complaints reaching me come from a relatively small group of areas, in particular coastal resorts and other districts favoured byretired people where property values (and consequently rateable values) are high,there is little or no industry to carry part of the burden, and the assistance receivedfrom Exchequer grants is below average.6. If anything is to be done at this stage it must therefore be on a selectivebasis. Something could be done to help some of the hardest hit areas by modifying the present general grant formula to provide that no local authority&apos;s share of the this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT3216
grant, when expressed in terms of so much per head of population, should fall below a stated proportion of the national average. If the minimum was fixed at85 per cent, this would give substantial help to Bournemouth, Eastbourne,Blackpool and a- few other authorities at a cost to the Exchequer of about 3-3r million.i\ 7. We might also put more money into the grant for distribution to those areas where the proportion of old people is high; at a cost of about  5% million,for example, we could pay an additional  5 for every old person in excess of aratio of 100 per thousand. This would help most of the areas which are hard hit,though it would help others as well; and the benefit would, of course, be spreadover all ratepayers in the areas concerned and not confined to the elderly.8. But general grant goes only to counties and county boroughs. We cannot therefore by this means do anything for the hard-hit county district in a countywhich by and large is not badly affected (e.g., Lytham St. Annes in Lancashire);and we cannot do anything for the individual cases of hardship which may ariseanywhere. The best way of dealing with these would, I think, be to give localauthorities power to reduce the rates of domestic ratepayers on grounds of hardship.9. What I have in mind is not a general power that would be to anticipate the report of the Allen Committee but a power confined to cases whererevaluation had resulted in an exceptionally steep increase. Even if there had been no revaluation, rate-bills in 1964-65 might be expected to be on average 10 to15 per cent higher than those in 1962-63 (the last pre-revaluation year) becauseof the normal growth of expenditure, and in some cases might easily be 20 per centup. The power might therefore be limited to cases where next year&apos;s rate bill was at least 25 per cent and  5 higher than that for 1962-63; any excess over thisqualifying increase would be open to remission.10. In most areas the cost of any relief given on hardship grounds could becarried without difficulty by the other ratepayers. But where householders generally are already labouring under a heavy increase, and cases of hardship are likely tobe correspondingly frequent, substantial Exchequer assistance would seemessential. In any case the Government must be seen to encourage local authoritiesto use the discretionary power, if the proposal is to be at all acceptable. A possiblescheme would be to leave the local authority to carry the cost up to the yield of a penny rate, to pay grant thereafter at 50 per cent until the remissions equalled the equivalent of a threepenny rate, and to pay grant at 66-f per cent on expenditureabove this level. This might cost something like  4 million, though a close estimate is impossible.11. Proposals on these lines would enable local authorities to mitigategenuine hardship resulting from the revaluation, and provided that they were acceptable to authorities generally they should hold the fort. But that is not to saythat they would be assured of a favourable reception. Relief on hardship groundsmust involve inquiry into means, which will be unpopular; and local authorities for their part would be faced with an invidious task in administering any such scheme.12. There is also a real risk that if we introduce modest measures on theselines we may be accused of trifling with the problem. An Exchequer contribution of about  13 million looks small beer in comparison with the  500 million or sowhich householders will have to find in rates next year, or the likely increase ofabout  100 million in the total rate levy, about half of which has to be found byhouseholders. We shall be told by some of our own supporters that our proposals are quite inadequate and getting them through Parliament will not be easy. few of the constituency resolutions to the Conservative Party Conference call for interim action, the main emphasis being on the need for a remodelling of the localgovernment financial structure to make the rate burden more equitable.13. This brings me back to the question whether we would be better advised to stand firm and on this I seek the views of my colleagues. My personal view isthat it would be worthwhile introducing the interim measures I have outlined.I am sure that, once the Allen Committee has provided the necessary statisticalbasis, we are going to have to put in hand a comprehensive review of the wholefinancial relationship between central and local government and I would suggestthat the Chief Secretary might say as much in replying to the debate. This would.
think, do a lot to reassure the Government^ supporters and would provide a background against which the interim proposals could be outlined. I should add that I do not envisage a review by an independent committee, which I would thinkquite unsuitable; but an examination carried out by central Government in collaboration, as necessary, with the local authorities.14. If my colleagues agree that we should take the interim steps I have described, I will work out detailed proposals with a view to introducing a Billearly in December. I shall need to discuss the proposals with the local authority associations before they can be finalised and that ought to be put in hand at once.15. I have not been able to discuss these proposals with the Secretary of Statefor Scotland; but if the Cabinet agree that something has to be done in Englandand Wales I will do so at once in order to see how far anything similar needs to bedone in Scotland, where there has been no revaluation since 1961.16.   To sum up:(i) do my colleagues agree that we should take some interim action now,rather than await the report of the Allen Committee?(ii) if the answer to (i) is yes, do the proposals outlined in paragraphs 6 to 10seem to be on the right lines?K.
