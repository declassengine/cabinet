Confidential)        Cape Town,My Lord, May 14, 1963.On leaving this post after four and a half years as High Commissioner, for nearly twoyears of which I have been Ambassador, Ihave the honour to submit some reflectionson South African affairs relating par-ticularly but not exclusively to the period ofmy stewardship.The World of Dr. Verwoerd2. &quot; In South Africa we are being carried forward as never before by an overwhelm-ing current of inspired nationalism.&quot; ThusDr. Verwoerd, on his assumption of office as Prime Minister in September 1958 somefour months before I took up my appoint-ment here. Nationalism, in his terminology,means the domination of the NationalParty, and in 1958 it was already wellentrenched thanks to 10 years of massivelegislation by previous Nationalist Govern-ments, their manipulation of the Constitu-tion, the bias of the South African electoralsystem and the large-scale infiltration of nationalist supporters into the police,defence forces, civil service and judiciary.So Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s mission was first andforemost to supply the Messianic inspirationfor further advance.3. That he is naturally qualified and evendivinely appointed to do this is for himbeyond question. Any doubts on thesubject must have been dispelled when lessthan two years later he miraculouslysurvived the shots which a mentallyderanged assassin fired into his face. Thisconviction of absolute right, the totalexclusion of any possibility of error, lies atthe root of all Nationalist and moreespecially of all Verwoerdian behaviour.To a Western European it seems to owemore to the 17th than to the 20th century though there is an ominous Hitlerian smellabout it. When I suggested to Dr.Verwoerd, before the present parliamentary session, that he must be much preoccupied with  the  difficult  problems  ahead,  hisobviously sincere answer was that this wasnot so. He said in effect that once the majorpremise had been clearly established (as ofcourse it had) it was only necessary to applyit to problems and situations as they aroseand the conclusions were inescapable. Day-to-day problems therefore presented no serious difficulty. The fact that he wasevidently not speaking for effect but expres-sing his real conviction made his words allthe more frightening. Again, his anger a tour celebrating The Queen&apos;s Birthday thisyear with an afternoon party at which a fewnon-Europeans were among the guests (aswell as with a conventional morning one for members of the Government), and hisbehaviour while lengthily castigating me onthis count during my last interview, revealedan intransigence genuinely incapable of seeing that there was any problem at all onsuch an occasion for a British Ambas-ambassador and a bully&apos;s mind which assumed that I dared to oppose him only becauseSouth Africa was a small country whomBritain thought that she could bully.4. It is only when one takes account ofthese mental processes that one can under -stand such remarks as those which Dr.Verwoerd made after Sharpeville, when hesaid that the recent disturbances could inno way be described as a reaction to theGovernments apartheid policy and had nothing to do with poverty, low wages orthe pass laws. They were a &quot; periodicphenomenon &quot;, by which he seemed to mean a manifestation of original sin. facts which, when the major premise is applied,cannot be fitted into his syllogism, areunfacts. Other men, members of his ownparty, even Cabinet colleagues, mayoccasionally deviate, as when Mr. PaulSauer (Minister of Lands and a CapeNationalist who has for long been uneasyat the more extreme policies of his Trans-vaal colleagues) in his speech at Humans-dorp described Sharpeville as the &quot; turningpoint &quot; at which the &quot; old book &quot; of SouthAfrican history was closed and called for anew approach to the native question.  But
such a hint of heresy was not allowed topass, and other Cabinet colleagues werequick to assure the faithful that the earthwas still flat. &quot; If any statement is to bemade in regard to basic policy that state-ment will be made by the Prime Minister &quot;said Mr. Eric Louw the day after Mr.Sauer&apos;s speech and was loudly applaudedfrom the Nationalist benches.5. Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s towering dominancewithin his party is to-day the one reality inthe otherwise unreal world of South Africanparliamentary politics. Being a Dutchmanby birth and a one time professor ofapplied psychology he perhaps knows hisAfrikaners better than they know them-selves. He understands their deeply splitmind the determination of a communitylong cut off from the outside world to main-tain white supremacy come what may, andat the same time the need, at least of themore responsible Afrikaners, for a policy towards the non-white which can be madeto appear intellectually and, according totheir lights, morally respectable. Theformula of apartheid or &quot; separate develop-ment &quot; can be represented as offering thenecessary combination of reassurance to thewhites (Dr. Verwoerd has stated explicitlythat its essential purpose is to safeguardwhite rule) and acknowledgment of theright of non-whites to &quot; self-development &quot;in &apos;; their own areas &quot;. To his followers thequestion whether the policy is practicableis wholly academic, so unthinkable for them is any alternative.Sharpeville and after. I have written first about Dr. Verwoerdand his party because they must be expectedto dominate the South African scene for atleast some years to come. Even if somemiracle removed Dr. Verwoerd from the scene tomorrow, someone from the Trans-vaal would step into his shoes probablyMr. Vorster, the Minister of Justice, or ifhe were thought too young at present,Senator de Klerk, the Minister of theInterior and the Verwoerdian soul would go marching on. Nor need we consider, for present purposes, the remote possibility (onwhich some members of the official Opposi-tion place their hopes) that splits inNationalism might appear, Dr. Verwoerdlose his position and Sir de Villiers Graaff,the United Party leader, join a coalition government under some &quot; moderate&quot;Nationalist Prime Minister. All guesses, Ibelieve, about the future course of events inthis country and all proposals for our own policy towards it must at present be basedon the assumption that the existingNationalist regime continues. If eventsprove otherwise as of course they may it is likely to be as a result of violentupheaval rather than of any peaceful evolu-tion; for Verwoerdism has deliberatelyrejected as impracticable the search for a middle way. But the outcome of any majorconvulsion in Southern Africa is souncertain that it is not yet possible to makespecific provision for the contingencieswhich might then face us.7. Thus when we try to assess the pros-pects it is worth considering first of all thosefactors which are most likely to affect the calculations of South Africa&apos;s present rulers.And here one must mention one thing whichconditions, even to-day, so much of the out-look of white South Africans: namely luck.First, of course, there is the material wealthunparalleled in the world outside north america and quite fabulous by Africanstandards which has made many south africans regard riches as a natural birth-right. There is also the geographicalremoteness which has saved South Africafrom the more damaging effects of twoworld wars the second of which especiallyhastened her industrialisation and has sofar left her still largely insulated fromindependent Africa. How different wouldbe the scene in Southern Africa to-day if, forinstance, Mozambique and Angola had beenFrench or Belgian instead of Portugueseterritories and had already been given inde-pendence? South Africa has been fortun-ate too in being able to count on thesupport of the leading Western States at theUnited Nations in resisting sanctions eventhough the same States have repeatedlycondemned her policies.8. At least until recently most whiteSouth Africans had come to take this luckfor granted; and even to-day it stronglycolours their view of the world. It showsno more than a proper sense of fitness onthe Almighty&apos;s part (thus many here believe)that the universe should be so ordered thatall exceptions to the general rule should bein favour of South Africa. True, in thepanic after Sharpeville it seemed that thebubble might have been pricked. even to-day business confidence has not fullyrevived and seems unlikely to do so. Butfor most of the white electorate there wasonly relief when things simmered downagain after the scare; it was not so bad294-56
Any government, however well entrenchedapparently, would face ruin if it failed inthis. While confidence has not been fatallyundermined as yet, the danger that it mightbe has clearly become more real; and theGovernment has not disguised its fear that,in future outbreaks of violence, local groups of whites might seek to take the law into their own hands. Should this occur, situa-tions could quickly develop which it wouldbe difficult or impossible to bring under control without drastic action against whitesas well as non-whites. Hence the recentefforts to bring potential vigilantes and KuKlux Klan under some sort of discipline in home Guard units.11. More generally, the post-Sharpevilieatmosphere half relief that things were notworse, half fear that they might yet becomeworse-is not conducive either to vigorouseconomic expansion for which most of theother preconditions now exist, or to the sort of political confidence at home which theGovernment would wish to see when they come to confront external hazards, some ofwhich cannot be very far away. MoreoverSouth Africa&apos;s withdrawal from the Com-commonwealth, though it had no dramaticeffects, has served to underline theRepublics isolation in a dangerous world and to inhibit a revival of long-term con-fidence. Many English-speaking south africans, though their early dismay hasworn off, feel continuing distrust andresentment at the manner in which the nationalists got their way. There is now a real chance that the Governments racialpolicy may become a serious matter of con-tention between the white groups: not because of any basic disagreement aboutaims but because territorial apartheid, if it comes about, will be mainly at the expenseof areas of English settlement in the EasternCape and in Natal. Thus white SouthAfrica remains uneasily united, and inindifferent shape to face a crisis.The Outlook for South Africa12. The crisis may be precipitated from outside or from within; eventually a com-bination of external and internal pressuresis likely to come about, since the strugglefor power in Southern Africa will not be contained within frontiers, least of all thepatchwork boundaries inherited from thelast century. This is well realised here; and recent developments in Central Africa andthe progress of the High Commission Terri-tories    towards    self-government    haveafter all, and the Government would nodoubt be as good as its word and keepthe blacks in their place. Clearly it wouldbe folly to take chances, as the British were doing in Central Africa, with multi-racialexperiments. Verwoerd might not have thecomplete answer, but his ideas were probably better than anyone else&apos;s. Backhim and South Africa&apos;s luck might after allyet hold. Anyway, what was the alterna-tive?9. Such attitudes, in the short term, have worked to the Governments advantage.They explain why there has been so littleserious opposition to draconian legislation.After Sharpeville Sir de Villiers Graaff, itis true, stated cogently the case against theGovernment^ policy: that its effect was to&quot; break all bridges of consultation&quot; withthe non-whites; that &quot; you cannot go onhaving a large section of the population with whom you have no contact, whom you donot allow to have any say at all in respectof the government which governs them&quot;;that &quot; our aim among these people shouldbe the establishment of ... a middle classentitled to own property, who have a stake in maintaining law and order &quot;; that thesystem of racial classification should bedone away with and the pass laws drasti-cally amended.  But he and his party voted for the Unlawful Organisations Act (whichdrove  the  two   main  African  politicalorganisations underground) without receiv-ing any assurance that any of these wrongswould be put right.   More recently theyhave voted for Mr. Vorster&apos;s &quot; Sabotage &quot;Bills without insisting on any substantialamendment of the clauses instituting housearrest,   abolishing   habeas   corpus   andempowering the police to &quot; detain &quot; suspectsfor 90-day periods indefinitely prolonged.Dr. Verwoerd can hardly be blamed forconcluding that he is in no danger of losingthe initiative.10. Nevertheless, in the longer term, Mr.Sauer may prove to have been at least partlyright. There is little doubt that Sharpevilleand its reactions were a turning point andthat things will never be quite the sameagain. Most white South Africans are nowaware that the crust of normality on which their lives are built is precariously thin; andthis in turn has caused reactions which givethe Government reason for concern. Itmust always be a central preoccupation ofany white government in South Africa tomaintain confidence in its ability to protect the lives and property of the white electors.
increased South African awareness ofactual and potential danger.13. Unfortunately the Government,instead of turning its attention to rootcauses, still thinks of the danger primarily in military and police terms. Expenditureon the armed forces has almost doubled inthe last two years; and reliance is placedmainly on superior armament and techniqueto safeguard South African security againstrelatively unsophisticated opponents. Inter -vention in a neighbouring territory toprevent its becoming a base of operations against the Republic is not entirely to be excluded, though this would be hazardousenterprise given white South Africa&apos;sslender manpower resources and the simul-taneous demands of internal security.Meanwhile Angola, Southern Rhodesia andMozambique remain as an outer rampartof uncertain reliability and duration.14. One effect of this situation is to enhance the importance for South Africa ofthe High Commission Territories. In the short term they occupy an importantstrategic position, being outside theRepublic^ political and police control, but within the area of Greater South africa and with frontiers which could not all be effectively patrolled, still less be closed. Solong as Britain administers them, the territories are likely to remain open torefugees, though some co-operation can beexpected in controlling violent subversion.In the longer term, as the Territories reachindependence (and especially if the outerrampart is breached) conflict will be difficultto avoid.15. Yet South Africa&apos;s interest lies over-overwhelmingly in avoiding such conflict if at allpossible. Whether she can do so dependspartly on how an African revolutionary movement develops, partly on whether, aswith South Africa&apos;s foreign relationsgenerally, the Nationalists&apos; rigid doctrinewill prevent them acting in accordance v/with the real interests of the country. Dr.Verwoerd&apos;s hope appears to be that in thepresent transitional period he can keep the big stick of economic pressure behind hisback while reminding the Territories (and ourselves) of the facts of life, for instance bytightening control over the movement of&quot; work seekers &quot; from the Territories intothe Republic.16. But it is highly doubtful whether, forall the strength of South Africa&apos;s bargaining position, and for all the obvious need of avoiding simultaneous conflict on severalfronts, Dr. Verwoerd can ever make the con-cessions necessary to afford a chance of accommodating the Territories within aconfederation or &quot; Commonwealth&quot; ofSouthern Africa. Essentially he conceivesof them as potential Bantustans a concept-tion hardly to be reconciled either with thepolitical development of the territories under British tutelage or with the demandsof African nationalism.17. For the pattern of Bantustans-theterritorial expression of apartheid is essen-tially a design for the perpetuation of a con-quest. For any sort of parallel one has togo to CromwelFs Ireland and the reserva-tion, west of the Shannon, of a &quot; homeland &quot;for an otherwise helot population; or per-haps to Soviet Turkmenia or Tajikistan,where a relatively backward population is held, I understand, firmly in thrall behind ascreen of political quasi-autonomy and cultural and linguistic &quot; self-development &quot;.Neither the Basuto, Swazi or Tswana canbe expected willingly to accept such adesign for their own future: indeed it is stillfar from certain whether it will be acceptedby the Africans of the Republic. (TheZulus in particular are at present showingmarked lack of enthusiasm.) Much will certainly depend on how the Transkei ven-ture goes; and about this Dr. Verwoerd andhis Government probably know almost as little as anyone else.18. The intention, as Dr. Verwoerd hasclearly stated, is to perpetuate whitesupremacy, absolutely in the white area(87 per cent of the whole land surface) and indirectly in the Bantustans. The policythus has a natural appeal to the whites ofthe Republic, though the Nationalist Rightwing as well as the United Party boggles atthe &quot; sacrifices&quot; involved. The real difficulty lies in the fact that Dr. Verwoerdand his party have committed themselves tothis design, not as a possible solution but asthe solution which all clear-sighted patriotsshould acclaim, before it is at all certainthat the fundamental contradiction in theplan the need to keep effective controlover a &quot; self-governing&quot; authority canever be resolved in the circumstances of present-day South Africa. The plan is thusfortune&apos;s hostage and its ransom may be expensive. Kaiser Matanzima and theother tribal chiefs who are expected to actas the Governments commissaries can hardly fail, if they are to retain any authority with their own people, to push
\JDr. Verwoerd farther than he would like togo and face him with the alternatives ofgiving a degree of independence to theTranskei that would be difficult for goodNationalists to tolerate, or alternatively ofdisappointing public promises and admit-ting failure in the enterprise. Such an admission of failure, however elaboratelycovered up, would be a powerful blow to dr. Verwoerd&apos;s prestige.19. If in due course the rulers of theTranskei and other Bantustans can force theSouth  African   Government  into  some limited negotiations and concessions, theexperience may indeed have educationalvalue.  But it will still not touch the main problem, which arises from the total lack of contact between the Government and theleaders of those urbanised Africans whorepresent the main alternative centre ofpolitical  power  in  South Africa.    Fordespite the disabilities under which theylabour,   including   imprisonment,   housearrest, &quot; banning &quot; and the need to operateunderground, these men command a largeif mainly unorganised political following.They also have the prestige a gift from the nationalists who constantly assert that theonly alternative to white rule is black rule of being the nucleus of a potential successorgovernment.   As such they are inevitablyof interest to all, within and outside SouthAfrica, who accept the certainty of eventualchange.   But for the present they arebeyond the pale of politics as politics arepractised here.   Is it possible to conceivecircumstances in which any white govern-ment would admit them to a share ofpolitical power?   Or failing that, at least be prepared to treat with them as inter -locutors entitled to represent the views of animportant part of the population?20. So long as the great majority of SouthAfrica&apos;s white electorate continue to believethat white supremacy can be prolonged, even for a doubtful while, there is little chance ofan affirmative answer to either question.This melancholy judgment leads on to theconclusion that no important change can beexpected until the white population believethemselves to be faced with an extremehazard, and their confidence in the ability of the regime to protect their lives, property and privileges is sapped decisively. Thedanger is that when this time arrives it willbe too late. Many of the white population are so committed to present attitudes thatwhen scared they will instinctively reach fortheir guns.  The non-whites too may well prove to be beyond the power of their ownleaders to control. Their patience and discipline in the past have been remarkable;but there are signs that the cumulative effectof years of frustration and of the achieve-ments of black nationalism abroad isaltering their temper. Although the bannedAfrican National Congress (A.N.C.) itselfremains a well-disciplined body, it is themore primitive and violent Pan-AfricanistCongress (also banned) which has attractedsupport recently; and this is something ofwhich the A.N.C. in its turn must take account.21. One is often asked at what point inthe future one foresees the arrival of thisclimax: for most people assume in a vagueway that it will come some day. My own view, as I have suggested above, is that it willrequire simultaneous pressures from out-side and within to bring South Africa to thepoint of crisis. Internal pressures exist andare visibly increasing. The external pres-sures are less immediate though they too arebuilding up. Events in Central Africa have caused a renewed nervousness, and Mr.Field&apos;s prospects in Southern Rhodesia arenot viewed here with optimism. South-West Africa is a large question mark; andwith its future is tied up that of the alreadydiminishing support South Africa com-mands at the United Nations. The portuguese-guese territories seem reasonably secure atpresent, but the Republic has no power to influence developments there. Hope thatthe tide of Africanism would spend itselfbefore reaching South Africa&apos;s frontiers is unlikely to be realised. In any case theHigh Commission Territories are likely soon to be under African administrationswhich whatever the degree, of continuingBritish involvement and responsibility can be at best precariously neutral.22. Though all in varying degrees un-favourable to South Africa, these factorsare not subject to any predictable time scale.All that can be said with reasonable cer-tainty is that the establishment of inde-pendent African States neighbouring on south Africa cannot be very long delayedand that thereafter the internal Africanresistance movement, having easier access tooutside aid and advice, will probablydevelop beyond its present rudimentarystage into an organised guerilla movementbacked by the majority of world opinion.23. Although this prognosis seems toleave little room for optimism I am notmyself entirely pessimistic. Verwoerdism inCONr mraiH i
its present form must collapse eventually forthe simple reason that it is not only evil but cannot be made to fit the facts: it is a policy for putting back into their shells eggswhich were broken long ago (when SouthAfrica first began to become industrialised).Its irrelevance to the modern Republic mustbecome increasingly apparent; and thosewho disagree with it particularly withinthe Nationalist Party and the DutchReformed Church but who at present hidetheir heads may grow more willing to come out into the open. As in Victorian England,the great majority of white South Africanscall themselves Christians and still flock tochurch. Christianity, as an intelligentNationalist said privately to me the otherday. is a much more serious long-termthreat than Communism to whitesupremacy. A powerful shock is neededbefore there can be any new alignment ofpolitical forces; but it is not a foregone con-clusion that such a shock would have toproduce chaos before any new dealemerged. The essential thing is that politicsshould be given the chance they have neverhad in South Africa for 50 years.24. For although in a superficial senseSouth Africa is a highly political country,with ;&apos; politics&quot; entering into everythingfrom golf to garden parties, there is an almost complete vacuum of politics in thereal sense real, that is, if a primaryfunction of politics is the adjustment ofconflicting interests within a society. Dr.Verwoerd, with his nostrum of &quot; separatedevelopment&quot;, has sought as it were toconjure politics away by claiming that inSouth Africa there can be no single society and there need therefore be no adjustment.In so doing, he has forced on south africans, in the words of Dr. Jan Steytler(leader of the Progressive Party), &quot; a choice between a European or a non-Europeannationalism&quot;. The outcome of such a choice is for the vast majority only too pre-dictable. But there are many besidesMr. Oppenheimer who understand that south Africa is, whether she wishes it ornot, a multi-racial society; and that eventsmust sooner or later compel a dialoguebetween the groups. The uncertainquestion is how long the whites can hope tokeep the initiative and whether they will begalvanised into using it before it disappears.The Options for Britain25. Whatever the outcome of apartheidpolicies, South Africa must expect to meet7/African and possibly other pressures from outside, while inside its own camp Africansheavily outnumber its white population. Insuch circumstances white South Africa isunder an overpowering necessity to come to terms with its own Africans while timeremains. Its dilemma is that it stands no reasonable chance of doing this under aregime of the present type. The most likelyprospect is therefore that of a prolongedrearguard action in defence of power andprivilege and later perhaps of power alone,for once the struggle ceases to be one-sidedthe white population can scarcely hope toretain its present living standards orprosperity.26. As this struggle for power develops,Britain in her turn will be faced withsharpening dilemmas:(a) It will become increasingly difficult tocontinue treating South Africa ashalf-ally and half-untouchable at thesame time; we shall have moredifficult choices to make between ourconflicting interests in keeping on terms with the regime on the onehand and avoiding outrage to blackAfrican opinion on the other.(b) Pressures at the United Nations like-wise seem certain to become moreuncomfortable. The choice whichmay soon face us may no longer b&amp;whether or not to agree to participate in sanctions but whether or not wecan and should actively resist their application. An international crisisover South Africa, such as could result from an attempt to enforce a judgment of the International Courtagainst the country, would offertempting opportunities to the Com-munist Powers to pose and performas active champions of free Africaagainst the last stronghold of whitedomination and would place theWest, and ourselves especially, in a severe predicament.(c) In determining the future of the high commission Territories we find our-selves placed between our duty to theinhabitants whom we cannot, so longas we hold responsibility, subject tothe Verwoerdian pattern which theyrightly reject, and our knowledge that their future is neverthelessinextricably bound up with that ofthe Republic.27. In considering the choices before uswe must, as I have said above, assume thatCONFIDENTIAL
regime, they may well seek from us some form of continuing political protection too.It is hard to see how this could be given ina way which did not place us in a positionof responsibility without power; and toaccept such a position would get us the worst of several worlds.30. By the standards of even 10 years agonone of the Territories is yet ready for self-government, let alone for independence.But such standards have changed abruptly,and Swaziland or Bechuanaland is entitled,if it likes, to claim to be as qualified for independence as Ruanda or as Chad. If,as at present seems more likely, the Terri-tories seek the advantages of both inde-pendence and protection, we shall have toshow ourselves both critical and reluctant.Meanwhile, our own interest dictates thatfor the next few years while we are stillresponsible for their government we should seek, through increased financial aid, toprepare them so far as is humanly possibleto stand on their own feet when the time comes. Only if they are as confident and self-reliant as we can make them will theyhave a chance of holding their own whenthey are exposed to the more exacting trialswhich will face them as they becomeself-governing.31. Thus as the situation in southern africa develops our own dilemma can hardly fail to become more acute. Ourgreat commercial and financial stake in theRepublic, our position in the territories and our defence requirements alike give usa strong interest in South African stability.But stability without political change cannotprove lasting; and the chances of changewithout convulsion, though I believe theyhave not finally disappeared, must become increasingly remote. In these conditions weshall need frequently and critically to reconsider where the balance of our interestlies and how much support of any kind weshould continue to give the Government ofSouth Africa.32. I am copying this despatch to her majesty&apos;s Representatives in washington and New York, to the British High Com-missioner in Salisbury and to the ColonialOffice.I have, &amp;c.JOHN MAUD.Dr. Verwoerd is to be with us for a con-siderabie time. He, for his part, badlyneeds such support as he can get from usinternationally, and especially he needs tomaintain good working relations with usover matters affecting the High commission territories. We on our side have no interest in promoting or condoningviolence; and I have already told the SouthAfrican Government that it is our policy to do what we can to prevent action in anyof the Territories which is designed tofoment violence in the Republic. There isno doubt that this policy is in our own interest and that of the Territories. But in giving effect to it we shall expose ourselves to criticism and risk giving colour to the belief that we are in league with Dr.&quot;Verwoerd. Against this we shall have toshow, first, that our policy towardsdeserving political refugees remains un-changed and, secondly, that any action we take is firmly based on the Territories&apos; own interests, and, if possible, that it has thesupport of their chosen representatives.28. Developments at the United nations are harder to foresee.
