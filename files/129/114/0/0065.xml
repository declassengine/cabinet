COHEITTEEROLLS ROYCE FACTORY AT BAST KILBRIDEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland o      During- recent months there has been a decline in total employmentin the Rolls Royce factories both in England and in Scotland.    Even so,Rolls Royce consider that they have more production capacity than theirpresent and prospective orders will support, and that they must therefore reduce unproductive overheads by cutting down the factoryspace they occupy.2.      The solution they most favour is to vacate their factory in east Kilbride which the Ministry of Aviation specially built for themin 1956 at a cost of  2.5 m. and now leased to them.    Of the 2,800jobs at present there, 1P00 would be transferred to Derby and theremainder to another- Scottish factory at Hillington, nearer Glasgow.By this reorganisation Rolls Royce estimate that they will saveaiCi 5,000 per year.    Alternativo^y, while the company are not preparedto transfer work iVum England to Scotland,  they are willing to con-sider a reorganisation confined to Scotland wbijo ma int. airing presentemployment there,  if the Government will compensate them - to thesum of  250,000 - for the reduced savings which they would then make.3-      Rolls Royce occupy a very special place in Scotland, not only because of their prestige, but also because of the very highly skilled,employment which they provide  (they still employ over 10,000 people in Scotland), and because they have built up a quite considerabledesign unit in Scotland.    The redundancies which they have already made in Scotland have caused considerable anxiety, which the ScottishTrades Union Congress took the opportunity of stressing to the PrimeMinister earlier this year.    My enquiries at that time, elicited an assurance that the company did not expect any further run-down inScotland beyond what they had already announced;  indeed they said they hope to take on more labour later in the year. Any further run-down of the company&apos;s employment in Scotland will therefore cause a disproportionate shock.ho     Moreover,  the transfer of 1 ,000 highly skilled jobs from scotland to England, and in particular from an area of high unemployment(nearly 7 per cent) to an area of virtually full employment (theunemployment rate at Derby is about 2 per cent), would be seriouslydamaging to our political credit.    Especially since the Budget, theGovernment have been publicly and forcefully committed to arrestingthe drift to the more industrially congested areas:,,  and to stimulatingdevelopment elsewhere,    A failure to prevent a major firm closing animportant factory in a development district,  and. moving a thousandjobs to the industrially congested Midlands, would be severely criticised as a failure of policy and a demonstration of the Government&apos;inability to put its preaching into practice.5.      Finally,  the repercussions of this closure upon the programme ofaided growth and development which we are about to launch in Central1 .COPY NO.  //^^
Scotland would be particularly serious at this time.    The White paper on the economic development of Central Scotland is scheduled for publication at the end of next month, and deserves to be regardedas the most significant and important policy statement in the economicfield in Scotland which has appeared for a long time.    It is vital toobtain the best possible reception for the White Paper&apos;s proposals.The closure of Rolls Soyce&apos;s factory at East Kilbride would not only have a bad affect on morale and confidence, but would also tend tocast serious doubt on the whole policy of growth.    East Kilbride isthe oldest Fcottish New Town and has indeed been the fastest growtharea in Scotland: I would be quite unable to play down its importancein this context.6.      In these circumstances it seems to me essential to avoid the closure of the East Kilbride factory and the transfer of 1 yi000 jobsto Derby, even though this involves some extra Exchequer expenditure.I fully appreciate the awkwardness of offering a subsidy to rolls royce, however it may be concealed, more particularly against the back-ground of the pressure which the Minister of Aviation has been generally applying to the aircraft industry to make themselves asefficient as possible.    But I think the following considerationsdeserve to be borne in mind:(i)    Without casting any doubt on the rightness of Rolls Royce&apos;commercial judgement,  it is I understand fair to say that theprospects of the aircraft industry over the next year or two are somewhat obscure.    It would not therefore be unreasonable toassist a firm to maintain a little surplus capacity until thesituation became clearer.(ii)    To pay a subsidy for a limited period to maintain employmentin a development district would not be an innovation in theaircraft industry.    The Government have gone out of their way togive special help to Shorts of Belfast whose production costs aresignificantly above those of their Great Britain competitors.Not only have the Government accepted an increase in the cost ofthe v.c.10 contract in order to enable Shorts to obtain sub-contract work, but they have also agreed to provide the firm with very considerable funds to enable them to complete work on the belfast freighter and the Seacat missile,  and have guaranteedtheir sub-contract work on the O.R.351   even though it involvedH.M.G.  in extra expenditure.(iii)    The very special relationship that has long existed betweenthe Government and firms in the aircraft industry should not makeit difficult to resist suggestions from other industries thatthey should receive comparable treatment.(iv)    If Rolls Royce were embarking on capital expenditure tomaintain employment tat East Kilbride, they would qualify for grant and loan-under the&apos;local Employment Act and&apos; would&apos; -qualify for free depreciation under the Finance Act for any plant they wished to instal.    The public will find it hard to understand why the Government should be perfectly willing to give grantaid of at least  1  m. under the Local Employment Act to avoid the loss of 1,000 jobs in a development district, but is notprepared to spend a quarter of that amount annually for alimited period to enable Rolls Royce to keep a thousand jobs ina Scottish area of heavy unemployment rather than transfer themto a low unemployment area in the Midlands.
AIN.Mfj 6 a7.      I am not myself in a position to suggest how best the necessaryaid can be channelled to Rolls Royce;    this is something that willhave to be worked out between the Treasury and the Ministry of aviation.     But I ask my colleagues to decide that some m^a^s of doing so must be found.M.A.C.N,Scottish OfficesWhitehall,S.W.1 .12th September, 196^.
