Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1963C. (63) 156 Copy No.   BE17th September, 1963CABINETNYASALAND AND NORTHERN RHODESIA CONSTITUTIONALQUESTIONSMemorandum by the First Secretary of StateNyasalandOn 23rd and 24th September I shall be engaged in talks with Dr. H. K. Banda,the Prime Minister of Nyasaland. There are two issues on which I should welcomemy colleagues&apos; concurrence.The Date of Independence2. Dr. Banda wants a date for independence. He proposes either 3rd Marchor 6th July, 1964, and is believed to favour the latter date. I am sure the right course is to grant independence at the earliest possible date compatible with an orderly transfer of authority and a settlement of Nyasaland&apos;s difficult financial problems. On that criterion, and having regard to the complications arising fromthe dissolution of the Federation, the July date is to be preferred. I do not thinka later date would be negotiable and from our point of view there would, in mysubmission, be no advantage in further delay. I therefore seek agreement to acceptthe July date and announce the decision at the conclusion of my talks withdraw. Banda. I would, of course, impress on him the necessity for a settlement ofthe territory&apos;s financial problems before that date.The Form of Independence3. Dr. Banda, who is supported in this by the Governor of Nyasaland, has intimated that he would prefer Nyasaland to have a period of 6-12 months of independence whilst still acknowledging Her Majesty as Head of State beforemoving to republican status. Whatever the form of government, he wishes theterritory to remain within the Commonwealth.4. Among his reasons for this he no doubt has in mind the inevitable financialrelationship which will continue to exist between Nyasaland and the UnitedKingdom, as well as his personal need for the advice of a British Governor-General(presumably the present Governor) for a period. He also believes that this coursewould be preferable to Her Majesty&apos;s Government and to that extent his suggestionis meant to be helpful.5. I recognise that there are arguments in favour of encouraging an immediatemove to republican status. A short and purely &quot; token &quot; period of monarchicalrule is undesirable in relation to the personal position to the Sovereign. It alsogives rise to Parliamentary problems as regards consequential legislation after independence and possible difficulties over appeals to the Judicial Committee ofthe Privy Council.6. On the other hand a transitional period of Monarchy, even thoughrecognised as transient, is calculated to assist the territory in its movement intoindependence, and may be expected to have a considerable bearing on credit-worthiness and on the morale of expatriate civil servants, business men andinvestors.3165
. . 7. Moreover, it could well be politically embarrassing for Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and Parliament to be associated, and indeed responsible in law, forthe introduction of a republican Constitution on the lines that Dr. Banda mightdesire. This, to my mind, outweighs the opportunity we should have of influencing the republican Constitution and the risk that, if the latter is left to a completelyindependent Government, they may at that stage sweep away safeguards andmslJitutions which we shall have put into the independence Constitution.8. My view therefore is that there should be a period of monarchical status,and subject to the views of my colleagues I would propose to settle the matter withdraw. Banda on that basis.The Constitution9. The form and content of the Constitution will depend to a considerable extent on the decision taken on the question of republican status, but broadly speaking what I have in mind (subject to detailed negotiation later) is a Constitutionon the following lines. There would be a Legislature of some 50 or 55 seats. All ofthese seats would be filled by elections on the basis of universal adult suffrageapart from four or five specially included to cater for minority representation.I understand that this arrangement would be satisfactory both to Dr. Banda andthe Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Blackwood) in Nyasaland. The franchise forthe minority seats would be designed, probably on the basis of citizenship, toextend only to the permanently settled European population.10. The independence Constitution would also embrace the Bill of rights which exists in the present Constitution. I would also hope to negotiate the retentionof the Right of Appeal to the Privy Council in fundamental rights cases and tointroduce reasonable safeguards in regard to the competence of the NyasalandGovernment and Legislature to promote constitutional changes.Northern Rhodesia Constitution11. Following recent discussions between the Governor and the leadersof the political parties which I hope will have removed the need for a fullConstitutional Conference, I have agreed in principle that Northern Rhodesiashall move to internal self-government. There have also been successful talks between the Northern Rhodesia Government and Barotseland. The aim is to holda general election under a new Constitution in January 1964 with full adult suffrage.The legislature will comprise 75 seats, 10 of which will be European Reserved Seats.There will be a Bill of Rights, and a Constitutional Council with executive powers which will be able to refer to the High Court any Bill which it considers infringesthe Bill of Rights. No date for independence has yet been discussed.Summary of Proposals12. I seek the agreement of my colleagues to the proposals in paragraphs and 8 above.R. A. B.Office of the First Secretary of State,King Charles St., Whitehall, S.W. 1,16th September, 1963.
