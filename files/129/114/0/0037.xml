(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)IMPROVEMENTS IN SERVICE pensions memorandum by the Minister of defence i have studied the memorandum by the Chief Secretary tothe Treasury (C. (63) 136).2.     I am under continuing pressure to improve the pensions of retired Servicemen and their widows,    I am by no means satisfied with the present system and I am not prepared to accept the chief secretary&apos;s conclusion that we should leave things as they are.3.     A year ago we were under the strongest pressure to do something for Service pensioners and the Debate on the Deedes motion of 25th May, 1962, was highly critical of our policy.4.     Since that Debate the 1962 Pensions Increase Measure has been passed and, following precedent, corresponding increases have beengiven to the pensions of the Armed Forces by Prerogative Instrument.During the course of the discussions on the Pensions Increase measure the developments that had taken place in the Governments thinkingtowards occupational pensions generally were explained in some detail.It was emphasised, for instance, that the idea of a Pensions IncreaseMeasure as a means of relieving real hardship had been abandonedsince 1956 and that current thinking now recognised the need for such measures to take account not only of real hardship but also of relativehardship, resulting from a reduction in the standards that the pensionersused to enjoy.    It was also claimed that the measure was more generousthan any previously introduced, not only because of the cost involved(over  22 million) but because of the special provision that was beingmade for those aged 70 and over.5,     My colleagues will recall that throughout the discussions onthe measure itself, and also during the subsequent Adjournment debate on Service Pensions, the view was very clearly and forcibly expressed that the current method of dealing with the problem of the rise in thecost of living and its impact on occupational pensions - both civil and service - no longer measured up to the needs of the times.    It waspointed out, for instance, that the present system, depending as it didfor its success (so it was alleged) on the perpetual lobbying andcanvassing of Ministers and Members of Parliament, was highlyunsatisfactory in itself and also failed to pi*provide the pensioner withany certainty that his interests would be adequately safeguarded in time.C,(63)137COPY NO.23rd July, 1963CABINET-1-
The difficulty of adequately protecting the interests of the Servicepensioner by the automatic adoption of the provisions of a measureprimarily designed for the civil pensioner was also emphasised.6.      The need for something more s^rstematic and definite than theexisting procedure was discussed at length during the Committee stage of the Bill.    The Chief Secretary himself did not claim that thepresent system was necessarily right and agreed to look at the whole matter afresh to see if some procedure could be evolved which wouldbe smoother and more effective than the present system.   In my judgment, and against the background of the general dissatisfaction with the results of the current procedure and our declared intentionto ensure that pensioners will continue to share in the good things which a strong and expanding economy will bring, Parliament and thepublic will expect some results from this study.Present Leyel^of^Pejisip^s^7.      Whatever may be said about current rates for those retiringnow, I am unhappy about Service pensioners who retired on the earliercodes.    There are, for example, some 18,000 retired officers, aged60 and over, drawing pensions under codes dated 1945 or earlier (i. e.they retired before 1950) the value of whose pensions has been erodedby between 7 and 26 per cent if they retired in the early 1920&apos;s or inthe 1940&apos;s and between 20 and 40 per cent if they retired in the mid-1930&apos;s.I doubt whether such a situation bears out our claim that our currentpensions policy has taken relative hardship into account.    Furthermore,some 30, 000 of the 53, 000 officers now retired and drawing pensions are aged under 60 and do not at present benefit from Pensions IncreaseMeasures at all, despite the fact that the value of their pensions has declined to a greater or lesser degree.    For example the pensions ofthe 7, 500 officers under 60 on the 1945 Code have already been erodedto the extent of between 28 per cent and 45 per cent.    Whether the basic system of adjustment is changed or not, there would seem to beno logical reason for confining improvements to those aged 60 or over.It might, perhaps, be possible to attempt to restrict any improvements to those who had received pensions after a full career, e. g. after theage of 55, but the case for such a restrictive policy would not seem tobe very strong.8.     I am also concerned about those widows who were bereaved before4th November 1958.    My colleagues will be aware of the intensedissatisfaction expressed about the Governments policy towards thesewidows.    The measure of the difference in treatment can be judged from the following examples.    The widow of a Bieutenant-Colonel orMajor bereaved on 4th November 1958 can receive a pension which is between 23 per cent and 33 per cent (dependent upon the husband5s retired pay code) greater than that of the widow bereaved before that date.    If,for example, each widow had two dependent children the disparity seven more striking.    In such a case, the widow of a Lieutenant-Colonelbereaved on 4th November 1958 can receive a pension which is between51 per cent and 64 per cent greater than that of the widow bereavedbefore that date- and for a Major&apos;s widow the difference could be between 41 and 52 per cent.    I consider that as an absolute minimum-2-
we must remedy the position o  those bereaved before 4th November,1958.    The cost of bringing them on fco  he same basip aa those bereavedafter that date would only be about  200, 000;  and in my judgment itwould be possible to take this step in isolation without the repercussionsthe Chief Secretary fears.Review of Pensions in Future9.     I can see the disadvantages of handing over to an independent body the task of reviewing the position of pensioners and of making representations to the Government.    I agree with the Chief secretary that this is a matter of important policy which, I am sure, we shallbe right to keep firmly in our own hands without losing the initiative.10.    I am very mindful of the arguments enumerated by the chief secretary against the various methods of improving our presentprocedures.    I do not, however, believe that it is sufficient eitherto undertake to hold regular reviews or to look at special problems.Conclusion11.     To sum up, I feel that the time has come for a radical reviewof the principles on which pensions are adjusted.    This, I recognise,will raise difficult and complex issues.    The broad alternatives seemto me to be (a) parity and (b) automatic periodic adjustments on thebasis of movements in the cost of living with, as a third choice, thepossibility of a blend of the two.    Y/whatever else we do, I feelwe should abandon the restriction of pensions improvements to those over 60 years of age, and as an immediate step, we should bringall Service widows on to the same footing.12.    I propose -(a) that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury should be invitedto institute an inquiry into these issues in consultationwith other Ministers concerned and to report back tothe Cabinet;(b) that in the meantime we should announce an immediate decision to bring the widows bereaved before 4thNovember 1958 on to the same basis as those bereavedthereafter.Ministry of Defence, S. v7.1.23rd July, 1963-3-
