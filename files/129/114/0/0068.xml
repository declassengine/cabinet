Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1963C. (63) 168 Copy No.     6 430th September, 1963CABINETNEW TRIALS IN CRIMINAL CASESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentMy colleagues will have well in mind the recent Press publicity which followed the quashing by the Court of Criminal Appeal of the conviction of &quot; Lucky &quot;Gordon for assaulting Christine Keeler. The court quashed the conviction becauseof the existence of new evidence which, as was agreed by the prosecution, mighthave caused the jury to feel reasonable doubt of Gordon&apos;s guilt. The Lord chief justice in giving judgment said that it had to be fully understood that it was no part of the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal to re-try a case upon freshevidence: there was no power to do so and, in many ways unfortunately, therewas no provision for a new trial in such a case. This point has been taken up in themore informed public comment on the case for example in a Times leader of15th August and by Professor Goodhart in an article in the Daily Telegraph of21st August. When the House resumes the Government is likely to be under strong pressure to legislate to provide for a new trial in such a case.2. The relevant existing powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal are containedin section 4 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1907, which requires the Court to allow an appeal if they think that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on theground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to theevidence: or that the judgment of the court before whom the appellant wasconvicted should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on any questionof law: or that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice. A proviso to thesection enables the Court to dismiss the appeal, notwithstanding some irregularity,&quot; if they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred &quot;.The Court will apply the proviso and dismiss the appeal only if they are satisfiedthat, on the whole of the facts and with the correct direction, the only properverdict would have been one of guilty. Otherwise they will allow the appeal andquash the conviction even though the appellants guilt is hardly in doubt. TheCourt has frequently expressed regret that it had no power to order a new trial insuch cases.3. In 1948 the present Lord President moved an amendment to the criminla justice Bill in the House of Commons to give the Court of Criminal Appeal sucha power. The amendment was withdrawn on the Government accepting theprinciple; and in the House of Lords the Government introduced an amendmentempowering the Court &quot; to direct the appellant to be retried upon the whole or anypart of the indictment&quot;. The amendment was moved by the then Lord Chancellor,and supported by the then Lord Chief Justice, on the ground that it would enablethe Court to avoid the acquittal of an appellant who was probably guilty andpossibly dangerous, but whose conviction could not be upheld either because therewas technical irregularity or minor misdirection or because the jury had returnedverdicts on two or more counts of an indictment which were inconsistent with one another. The amendment was accepted in the Lords, but subsequently disagreedwith by the Commons, where legal opinion was deeply divided. In 1952 the thenLord Chief Justice raised the matter again in the House of Lords and urged, inthe light of the case of Devlin and Burns (in which the then Home Secretary hadIHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT3219
2 CONFIDENTIAL ,iordered an inquiry into an alleged confession) that the power to order new trialswas necessary to obviate extra-judicial inquiries where fresh evidence was adduced.A Departmental Committee on New Trials in Criminal Cases, under thechairmanship of Lord Tucker, was appointed some months later.4.   The Committee&apos;s unanimous recommendations were:, (a) that the Court of Criminal Appeal should be empowered to order a new: ]%]-. trial of a convicted person where the appeal is based on fresh evidence which under the existing law and practice would be admissible on appeal;(b) that this power should be available in cases referred to the Court by theSecretary of State under section 19 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1907;(c) that a corresponding power should be given to the House of Lords.5. The Committee were agreed that in no circumstances should the Courtof Criminal Appeal have power to order a new trial on a count on which theappellant had been acquitted. Subject to this, a minority thought that there shouldbe unrestricted power to order new trials, whether or not there was fresh evidence.The majority disagreed with this, on the grounds:(a) that cases in which a guilty man had to be allowed to go free were rare,and there was no evidence that public opinion was disturbed about them;(b) that there was objection in principle to putting a man in peril twice forthe same offence, and to prolonging judicial proceedings, which shouldbe swift and final;(c) that it would be hardship to the appellant to have to undergo a secondtrial because of an irregularity for which he was not responsible;(d) that the second trial would not be, or at any rate would not appear to be,fair; and(e) that there was a substantial danger that new trials would be ordered toofrequently.The Committee&apos;s disagreement on this particular point reflected a disagreementamong their witnesses. A small majority of The Queen&apos;s Bench Judges were infavour of the Court of Criminal Appeal having power to order a new trial: theLaw Society were opposed to it as a violation of the principle that there shouldbe no second trial for the same offence: the Bar Council favoured a power to order a new trial in cases where there was fresh evidence.6. Partly because of the controversy thought likely to be caused by legislation and partly because of difficulty in finding time for it, no action has hitherto beentaken on the Committee&apos;s report. It was last considered by Parliament in the debates on the Homicide Bill (now the Homicide Act 1957), when amendments were putdown in both Houses designed to give effect to the recommendations on which theTucker Committee were unanimous, and Government speakers promisedconsideration of the Report in the light of the debates.7. I invite my colleagues to agree that we should now empower the Court of criminal Appeal to order a new trial where there is new evidence. The Home AffairsCommittee (H.A. (63) 19th Meeting, Item 3) has approved in principle thepreparation of such legislation, but was not unanimous on the desirability of introducing it next session. The arguments for immediate legislation are that byfilling an acknowledged gap in the law we should be meeting a widely expresseddemand of informed opinion, and that if we delay we shall lose an opportunity tosecure a reform which, on past experience, might otherwise be difficult to carry through Parliament. The contrary argument is that this is a subject which recent events apart is liable to be controversial: that we might be accused of being rushedinto hasty action as a result of the Gordon case: and that debates on the Bill wouldprovide opportunities for discussion of that case, and possibly of wider aspects ofthe Keeler affair.8. My own view is that we have most to gain by introducing legislation. Wecan meet any suggestion of precipitate action by pointing out that the Billimplements recommendations of a Departmental Committee which are already nine years old. A Bill confined to this point should not provide great scope for
wide-ranging debate; and in any event the Bill is unlikely to come up for secondreading until well into the session, after the debate on the Denning report willhave taken place.9. If we are to introduce legislation this session we should aim at as simplea Bill as possible. For this reason, and because of the objections of principle and practice noted in paragraph 5 above, I think it should authorise a retrial only wherethere is new evidence. I understand that the Lord Chief Justice, although he agreesin principle with the Tucker Committee minority, would be content on grounds of expediency with this limited power. The Home Affairs Committee agreed with my view while recognising that discussion in Parliament might show cause to reconsider the scope of the Bill (H.A. (63) 19th Meeting, Item 3).10. The power to order a new trial where fresh evidence was communicatedto the Court by the Home Secretary under section 19 of the Criminal AppealAct 1907 would be necessary because there might be cases in which new evidencecame to light after the convicted man had exhausted his own rights of appeal. Itwould, however, be unnecessary to provide expressly in any Bill for the House ofLords to have power to order a new trial on fresh evidence, as recommended by theTucker Committee. If the Court of Criminal Appeal has such a power it will automatically vest in the House of Lords by virtue of section 1 (4) of theAdministration of Justice Act 1960.11. If we decide to legislate, various details will require further consideration;for example, whether a new trial should be precluded after a long lapse of timewhen the main prosecution witnesses might have disappeared. I would pursuethese with the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General urgently.Summary12.   I ask the Cabinet to agree that:(a) the Court of Criminal Appeal should be empowered to order a newtrial of a convicted person where the appeal is based on fresh evidence which under the existing law and practice would be admissible on appeal;(b) this power should also be available in cases referred to the Court by theHome Secretary under section 19 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1907;(c) the necessary legislation should be introduced in the coming Session.H.
