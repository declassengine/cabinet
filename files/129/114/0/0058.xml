(THlg^OCUMENT IS TKS PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C. (63) 150COPY NO.61l?th September, 1963CABINETARMS FOR SOUTH africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department the Committee on the Export of Arms to South Africa, under my chairmanship, discussed on 13th September our future policy forthe export of arms to South Africa, talcing into account the resolution adopted by the Security Council on 7th August, 1963.Z.      It was generally agreed that, because of the assurance we gavein the Security Council that it was our policy to export no armswhich would enable the policy of apartheid to be enforced, some further restriction in the kind of weapons which we are prepared atpresent to supply to South Africa is unavoidable.    However, becauseof our strategic, financial and commercial interests in South Africa,and the likelihood that African opinion will not be satisfied by anythingshort of a complete arms embargo, it seems desirable that at thisstage any additional restrictions should be as few as possible.3.     So far as general categories of arms supply are concerned, theCommittee considered that there should be little difficulty aboutdefending the supply of ships, naval aircraft, naval ammunition andother equipment, including coastal and anti-aircraft artillery, whichare required for use in the protection of the Cape sea routes, and whose supply is consistent with the spirit of the Simonstown Agreement.On the other hand, whilst we must continue to fulfil contracts which wehave already entered into for the supply of weapons and for theirmanufacture under licence in South Africa, including certain items of equipment which might conceivably be used for enforcing apartheid,if we are to avoid charges of inconsistency we must not accept orders in future for such items as small arms, small arms ammunition, anti-personnel mines, smoke bombs, hand grenades and riot controlweapons such as tear gas, etc. .4.      Between these two extremes there is a broad area coveringsuch items as tanks, aircraft and artillery where, if any new orders areforthcoming, it seemed to the Committee that it would clearly benecessary for a decision to be taken by Ministers on each individualitem in the light of prevailing circumstances.    Meanwhile, however,some general guidance will be necessary for officials and those concerned with the day to day business.    For this purpose theCommittee reached the following broad conclusions.     While it is unlikely at the present time that we shall be asked to supply them, there seems strong objection to the supply of armoured fighting vehicles,including tanks and armoured cars.    Spares and ammunition for-1-
hi &quot;ivehicles previously purchased in this country are another matter, andif we are to avoid charges of bad faith we can hardly refuse to supplyreasonable quantities of both, although each request would have, to beconsidered on its merits, and we might wish to refuse majorreplacements such as new guns or gun turrets.5.      There are no current orders for the supply of either fightersor transport aircraft to South Africa..    However, the majority of theCommittee, with the exception of the Minister of State for Commonweal^.Relations who reserved his position, were generally in favour of meeting any reasonable further requests, although fighter aircraft might be used (as they were at Sharpeville) for the purpose ofintimidating African crowds, and although transport aircraft are undoubtedly essential for carrying troops and police reserves in theevent of trouble.    There seems even less objection to the supply of reasonable quantities of trainer aircraft.    However, the committee felt that before any decision was taken to export military aircraft to south Africa, the matter would need to be re-examined by ministers in the light of the then prevailing circumstances.6.      The public presentation of any change in our policy towardsthe supply of arms to South Africa is of such particular delicacythat in the view of the Committee there is much to be said foradhering in any public statements to the language used by the UnitedKingdom Delegate in his explanation of vote in the Security Council.It will however be necessary to provide a fuller confidentialexplanation of our position to the Secretary General of the united nations and, if necessary, to the Governments of the United Statesand perhaps certain other friendly nations with interests in arms supplies.7.     Finally, if we are to apply a more restrictive policy, we mustbe able to prevent transshipment in British ports of arms andmilitary equipment of categories which British suppliers would be prohibited from exporting to South Africa.    Under the present arrangements, which are designed to prevent embargoed goods goingto the Sino/Soviet bloc , a Transshipment Open General Licencepermits the unrestricted transshipment in British ports of any goodsdestined for the Commonwealth, the United States or the Irish Republic,and this freedom has been continued in respect of South Africa afterher withdrawal from the Commonwealth.    In order to close this gapit will be necessary to amend the Transshipment Open GeneralLicence so as to make it obligatory for all consignments of goodslisted in Group 1 of the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1963, which includes aircraft, arms and military equipment, to be covered by an individual licence when destined for South Africa.    Such an amendmentdoes not require Parliamentary approval, but any changes in the licensing regulations will have to be published.     The timing of such astep will therefore need to be carefully considered in relation to our general policy towards South Africa.    For the meantime it would-2-
seem sufficient if the necessary amendment were to be drafted and held in readiness for use if it came to knowledge that a significantamount of prohibited military equipment destined for South Africawas being transshipped in British ports,8.     On behalf of the Committee I invite the Cabinet to endorse the policy outlined above.LB.Home Office, S. V/.. 1.16th September, 1963-3-CONFSDENTIAL
