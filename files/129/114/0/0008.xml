Printed for the Cabinet. June 1963C. (63) 108 Copy No/ 5727th June, 1963CABINETSTAGGERED HOLIDAYSMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the problem of holiday congestionThe Government has been under pressure for some time to do somethingtowards spreading the holiday load. The extreme concentration of holidays in july and August is unwelcome to the holiday trades and to many holiday-makers, andmust involve an uneconomic use of our investment in holiday facilities. a widespread feeling that steps should be taken to produce a more rational holidaypattern emerged from House of Commons debate on the holiday season on12th February, 1960. Following a commitment which the Government thenundertook, Departments have been studying the causes of the present concentration of holidays, and the changes which would be necessary to enable those many people who are compelled against their preference to take their holidays at the peak by factors such as the timing of school and factory holidays, to take theminstead at less crowded times of the year. Confidential discussions have takenplace with a number of organisations that would have an interest in these changes.There is a list of these organisations at the end of the annexed draft White Paper.2. It is clear that the situation will not right itself in the passage of time,and that with the growing number of holidays it is indeed likely to grow worse.It is also clear that the changes that would be necessary to produce a more rationalholiday pattern would be fairly radical for examining boards, factories and other bodies which themselves have no direct concern with holidays as such.The case for a White papers. I believe that any inconvenience involved in these changes would be faroutweighed by the general benefits that would flow from a more even spread of holidays. The consultations with interested organisations showed that there is now a reasonable chance of getting these changes carried through, provided theGovernment is prepared to take the initiative for a general attack on the holidayproblem. Since this is a subject on which the public reaction is all-important, Ihave put before the Home Affairs Committee the draft of a White Paper designedto focus public attention on the issues involved. This factual statement of the size and nature of the problem of holiday congestion and of the measures that mightrelieve it is designed to sound out public opinion. Its publication would not initself commit the Government to taking particular remedial action. But publication would naturally carry with it the implication that if the public reaction justified itthe Government would take the initiative in tackling the problem.4. The majority of the members of the Home Affairs Committee are in favourof the publication of a White Paper on these lines. Some, however, have expressed doubts about the wisdom of ventilating the problem in this way at the present2713THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
time, on the grounds that there could be disadvantage in drawing attention to a problem which has been the subject of complaint for a number of years unless theGovernment could be seen to be doing something effective to provide remedies.5. Pressure for action to spread the holiday season already exists, and willbecome increasingly difficult to answer if we give no indication at the least of ourrecognition of the problem, and of the existence of possible remedial measures.Bank Holidays6. Doubts have also been expressed on various occasions about the advisability of referring in any Government statement to the subject of bank holiday dates, and I should therefore like to draw particular attention to the references in paragraphs 23 and 27 of the annexed draft White Paper. Strongopinions on Bank Holidays were spontaneously volunteered by many of the organisations which Departments have consulted about staggering holidays. these organisations have, indeed, made it clear that, in their view, this is the basic issue.The present date of August Bank Holiday contributes to congestion just at the peak holiday period, and while the association of a Bank Holiday with the movablefeast of Whitsun does not at present produce more than inconvenience, it wouldbe a serious obstacle to a long-term general effort to spread holidays more evenly.This is because the Whitsun Bank Holiday is commonly used by schools as the foundation for a short mid-term holiday. The key to the spreading of the holidayseason lies in an extension of the period within which schools can take their mainsummer holiday, and this could only be achieved if steps are taken to ensure thatthe G.C.E. examination is over significantly earlier than is at present the case. an interruption to the period within which the examination is taken by a long Whitsunbreak would make it difficult or impossible to get through in time,7. It seems to me to be necessary that a factual White Paper which attempts to set out in a comprehensive way the causes and possible cures of holidaycongestion should present these considerations. There is of course the implication that, if necessary, part of the Governmenfs contribution to an all-round effort to extend the holiday season would be to effect alterations in the dates of theseBank Holidays. A Government statement which made no mention of bank holiday dates would be criticised as incomplete, and as weakening the lead thatthe Government would need to give to the independent organisations which wouldbe responsible for the other changes. By and large, the remedial measures outlined in the draft White Paper are for non-governmental organisations to take, and apart from Bank Holidays, the Governmenfs role would be one of co-ordination and encouragement.8. The reference to the Whitsun Bank Holiday may be felt to raise special problems. There is of course no suggestion that the date of Whitsunday should be altered, but some of my colleagues have foreseen difficulty in dissociating theBank Holiday from the religious festival. When representatives of the variouschurches were sounded out by the Home Office about a similar proposal in 1948,none of those consulted in the established church, the Church of Wales, or thelree churches had any objection to such a dissociation, provided that the newBank Holiday did not carry the name of Whit Monday. Only the spokesman forthe Roman Catholic Church expressed regret at any proposal to transfer the presentholiday away from Whit Monday. Similar objections were expressed in 1960 byCardinal Godfrey&apos;s Private Secretary on the grounds that &quot; at a time when the religious significance of great festivals is passing from the minds of many of ourcountrymen we should regret any step which might reduce the religious significance of Pentecost, and alas there can be no doubt that if the Whit Monday holiday wereto be transferred to another week-end the religious significance of Whitsun would for many people tend to disappear &quot;. With all respect to these views, I am not convinced that they would justify us in omitting from any statement any mention of the problems posed by the fluctuation in the date of the present Bank Holiday.The opinion that a Bank Holiday on the following day should assist in preserving the religious significance of this great festival was not expressed by those consultedfrom the Church of England, and there are of course many cases where importantoccasions in the Church&apos;s year are not associated with a Bank Holiday AscensionDay is the obvious example.
DRAFT WHITE PAPERSTAGGERED HOLIDAYS
CONFmFJJstfAL0 3ANNEXSTAGGERED HOLIDAYSIntroductionBoth holiday-makers themselves and the trades that cater for themsuffer from the present concentration of holiday-taking. GovernmentDepartments have therefore carried out a survey of the whole problem,including an enquiry by the Social Survey Division of the Central Officeof Information, into the tastes and motives of holiday-makers, and theresults have been discussed with interested organisations in England andWales. Since the problem in Scotland seems less acute and the holidaypattern is different, similar discussions have not been held with Scottishorganisations although there were informal consultations with educationalinterests at the time of the Government Survey.2. It is clear that any cure for the situation revealed by the Surveydepends mainly on action that only private individuals and bodies can take,and that the spreading of the holiday load must involve changes in manysectors of the nation&apos;s life. Most of these changes are not themselves matters for direct Government action, but it does not seem likely that they wouldbe made or would be effective in extending the season except in the context of a concerted national effort by all concerned.3. The Government is therefore publishing the results of the central office of Information Social Survey enquiry at the same time as this white paper as a basis for informed comment and debate.The pattern of British holiday habits4. Since the war, holiday-taking has become the norm rather than theexception. In 1937 only about 15 million people left home for a holiday ofa week or more. The annual sample surveys conducted by the BritishTravel and Holidays Association show that by 1949-56 about half thepopulation about 23 million were taking a main holiday (i.e., one ofnot less than four nights away from home). By 1962 the number was over30 million or 60 per cent of the population, within which total about26  million people spent their holidays in Britain. But this is not the wholepicture. In 1962 about 4  million people took two or more holidays eachof four nights or more, so that including holidays taken abroad there were inall about 36 million holiday trips. The Social Survey enquiry shows that in1960 there were at least 1\ million day-trips. Secondary holidays and day-trips now contribute substantially to the total volume of holiday movement,particularly at week-ends and at Bank Holidays.5. The pattern of holiday accommodation and travel has changedconsiderably in the past decade. Relatively fewer people stay with friends,or at unlicensed hotels or boarding houses. More people go camping,hostelling or caravanning. Fewer people travel by train. The British travel and Holidays Association Annual Survey showed that in 1962 for the first2
time more than half the people taking holidays in Britain went by car,and the percentage travelling by rail had fallen to 26 per cent. But althoughthe type of holiday may be changing, the time at which it is taken is not.6. The British Travel and Holidays Association found that, in 1962,63 per cent of all main holidays were taken in July or August. The social survey reveals a very similar pattern in the year with which it is concerned,showiig that just about two-thirds of main holidays started in those twomonths. This is a pattern that has changed little since 1949. Within the peak months, there are further peaks. The British Travel and HolidayAssociation^ 1959 figures (which were the most detailed and up to dateavailable at the time of the Survey) showed that nearly a quarter of allmain holidays began in the single fortnight at the end of July and start ofAugust in which the Bank Holiday fell, and another sixth in the previoustwo weeks. The Social Survey further shows that nearly three-quarters ofall holidays started at the week-end mostly on Saturday and that duringthe peak the proportion was even higher. This means that nearly 7 million people left home for their summer holiday in one fortnight, and over  million in the previous fortnight, probably between 2 and 3 million leaving for their holiday at each week-end. In contrast to this concentration in july and August, the other summer months are relatively empty, except for the whitsun period a very popular time for supplementary holidays andday-trips. , \.7. The number of holidays taken in Britain will certainly increase. Asfar as main holidays are concerned, there must eventually be a ceiling,&apos; but since there are still at least 20 million people who do not take holidays away from home the ceiling has by no means already been reached. There is no obvious limit to the increase in the number of extra holidays. If nothing is done, mounting numbers of holidays of all kinds will make the problem ofa short concentrated season even more serious than it is now.The disadvantages of this pattern8. Since holidays vary in length, the facts elicited by the Social Surveycannot show exactly what is the maximum strain placed by this holidaypattern on accommodation. But at the beginning of August probably nearly6 million people will be taking their main holidays at the same time, inaddition to those who are away from home on secondary holidays or week-endtrips. In the period around the August Bank Holiday a large number of daytrippers about a further 3 million are also using road, rail, catering andentertainment facilities.9. The results are painfully obvious to those concerned crowds, packedtrains, traffic jams, poor service and high prices. If services are to be provided on a scale sufficient to meet the peak demand,: they are inevitably under-used at other times, and this means higher average charges all the year round.And since they are usually only: barely sufficient to cope with the peakdemand, overcrowding and discomfort at times is inevitable. This is a major piece of social inefficiency. ;;.../10. The present holiday pattern is as exhausting and inefficient for thosewho serve,the holiday-maker.as It is for, those, on holiday. 4n resorts, hotel sand restaurants, shops,, car-parks, amusements, and so, on... have . to,.recruit3 QfpIDIf^financial
extra staff. This is expensive, and temporary staff cannot always provide goodservice. The expenditure on road, rail and air transport to meet the demand at peak periods represents a most inefficient use of resources. The enquiry by government Departments learned that in 1959 the index of passengers carriedon United Kingdom domestic airlines reached 192 in July and 210 in Augustas against only 140 in June, 152 in September and 76 in April. On therailways it is estimated that nearly a quarter of the total passengers carriedtravel in July and August, and to cope with this demand it has been necessaryto keep up a level of stock and staff which is required on only a few occasionsin the year. Hotels suffer similarly. In the resort areas some better-knownhotels may have more than 90 per cent of their beds occupied at all timesfrom mid-June until well into September, and at the extreme peak manyof them are over-full, in the sense that if they are not to refuse requestsaltogether they have to meet demand by booking additional rooms outsidethe hotel and by overcrowding their restaurant facilities. On the other hand,many, if not most, of the resort hotels are closed in winter. Since, when theyare open, their overhead costs are largely fixed, their profitability dependsto a very high degree on the occupancy they can secure early and late inthe season. Hotels in the less popular resorts, less well-known hotels generally,and most boarding houses have a shorter &quot; fully booked &quot; period, often nolextending outside the last three weeks of July and the first three weeks ofAugust. Holiday peaks also put a strain on other local services. The DevonCounty Council has emphasised the financial burden which is involved for local authorities and their rate-payers in providing water, roads, and other services to meet extreme fluctuations in the population. In the case of SouthDevon, it is said that the normal population of 236,000 is annually raisedby about 60,000 by mid-July, and by over 100,000 in Bank Holiday weeks.11. Two groups of proposals in the recent Report on the Reshaping ofBritish Railways would affect holiday travel the reduction in the fleet of passenger coaches by the elimination of those kept for use only at a few peaksummer week-ends and the withdrawal of passenger rail services to a numberof holiday resorts and areas. The limitation of accommodation on peak periodtrains (the extent of which will be determined after a further survey of the usemade of stock this summer) would provide a spur to holiday-makers to spreadtheir holidays, but if other pressures prevented this, train travel might become more uncomfortable and the roads more congested. The withdrawal of passenger services to resorts would involve the substitution, often on aconsiderable scale, of alternative services by bus or coach as well as by privatecar. This might in some cases present a challenging task to road transportoperators and some spreading of the holiday period would materially improve the ease with which they could cope and the standard of service they could give, as well as easing the congestion which already exists on certain summerweek-ends on many roads which are more than adequate at other times. the changes proposed could certainly be much more easily handled to the benefit oftransport operators, of holiday-makers and of those catering for them ifholidays were evenly spread.Causes of concentration12. Few people go on holiday alone, and many different factors can affectthe holiday plans of a party all the members of which have to be free to take4
their holiday together. The Social Survey shows that in 1960 only 38 per cent of holiday parties were theoretically free to go away at any time in the summer. Other parties were, as might be expected, free-est in July and August only 26 per cent and 21 per cent of all parties would have been unable to getaway in those months, whereas in other summer months the proportions werebetween 40 per cent and 50 per cent. Far the commonest cause was the inability of a member of the party to get away from work, but unwillingness to takechildren from school or interfere with their examinations was also important.But in addition to difficulties arising from arrangements at work, school terms and examination dates, the dates on which holidays (main or subsidiary) maybe taken are influenced by other factors including the dates of town and public holidays.Employment13. Nearly one-third of those interviewed by the Social Survey put the closure of their place of business or the allocation of their holiday on a rota asthe main reason for the holiday date they chose, and a further 12 per cent ofthose who were technically free to choose gave convenience for work as themain reason for their choice.14. A sample enquiry by the Ministry of Labour on firms in manufacturing industry showed that in 1960 nearly three-quarters closed down entirely for works employees&apos; holidays (about a third operated this system for office staff)and that more often than not one or both weeks of the closure coincided withthe general holiday peak. Firms rarely closed in June or September except inthe North-West where there were many closures in June possibly because ofthe traditional staggering of Wakes Weeks there. The closure system is also inforce in the coal mining industry, where holidays are arranged locally betweenthe National Coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkers. Takingmanufacturing industry and mining together, probably about 6 millionemployees have their holiday dates determined by closures. Not all of them would necessarily take a holiday away from home, but on the national averageit would be reasonable to assume that three-fifths of them would do so.Through these people and their families, industry&apos;s closure arrangements mustcontribute substantially to the present holiday peak.15. In other sectors of the economy., general closures are not socommon. In commercial, professional and distributive business, and in thenational and local government service, it is usual to arrange for staff to takeholidays more or less on a rota. From their nature, rota systems should contribute towards the staggering of holidays. However, as the Ministry ofLabour survey showed, many employees choose to be away in July and august to fit in with other members of their family. Experience in the nationalised industries bears this out. Some firms probably encourage a largeproportion of their staff to be away at the same time at the peak of the holiday season because business is then slack. Rotas are clearly not soeffective in staggering holidays as might be hoped.Education16. School terms and examinations determine the dates on whichmillions of people can take their holidays, including many people whothemselves have no children at school. This is because when holiday dates5
for a number of persons are determined collectively, they are necessarilyfixed within the local school holiday period, so that workers with children are free at the same time as their families.17. Most maintained day schools in England and Wales have five to seven - weeks&apos; holiday in the summer beginning between about 20th july and 1st August. Except for a break at Whitsun, which is commonly as longas a week, schools rarely have holidays in May, June or early July. (Thereare some exceptions. For example, in Swindon school holidays have alwaysbeen related to the railway workshop holidays; and therefore begin on thefirst Saturday in July. In the Lancashire &quot; Wakes Week&quot; towns, schoolholidays have also been largely adapted to, fit in with the &quot; staggering &quot; ofthe town holidays over the period from mid-June to the end of August,and to local arrangements for &quot; Little Wakes &quot; in September and October.)The Minister of Education does not control the dates on which schools takeholidays and provided certain conditions are met (e.g., that schools should meet for at least 400 half days in the year) Local Education Authorities orschool governors may fix the holidays when they like. The reason whyin practice there is so little variety is the need to include in the schoolterm the period of the school-leaving examinations. Many schools, includingof course all primary schools, do not enter candidates for these examinations,but it is convenient for Local Education Authorities and the public if allthe schools in one area have their holidays in roughly the same period.Since the summer examinations normally fall between the end of May and thethird week of July, most schools do not break up until this latter date, andmost families with school children, together with the many others whoseholidays are determined by collective arrangements, find it difficult to take an earlier holiday. Theoretically children may be withdrawn from schoolfor up to a fortnight for an annual holiday, but many parents do not know of this provision or do not like to make their children miss school.18. The dates of the G.C.E. examinations thus probably do as much as any other single factor to set the present holiday pattern. What determinesthe timing of the examinations? There are sound educational reasons for having the main G.C.E. examinations in the summer, and towards the endof term, and the precise dates fixed by the Examining Boards are affected bythe need to choose times when examiners are readily available. many members of University staffs, who are needed for the marking of scholarshipand &quot;A&quot; level papers, are not readily available much before the end ofthe University terms, and school teachers, who form the bulk of theexaminers for the &quot; O &quot; level papers, cannot act in this capacity until themain activities of the school terms are over. Administratively, it would notbe easy for the Examining Bodies to complete the examinations very much earlier, particularly if the examination period were interrupted by a Whitsunholiday.19. In Scotland, the pattern is rather different. The Christmas and Easterholidays are shorter, not exceeding 10 days to a fortnight, and with few exceptions the summer holidays begin in the last days of June or the first days in July. For some schools they end about 15th August, but for the greatmajority they continue into the third and even the fourth weeks of that month.In Scotland, the examination for the Scottish Certificate of Education, the
equivalent of the General Certificate of Education, was until 1961 held inMarch or early April, but since 1962, when the Ordinary grade of the ScottishCertificate of Education was introduced, has been held in May.Town holidays. 20. In many of the towns of Lancashire, Cheshire and the West Ridingof Yorkshire local customary &quot; Wakes Weeks&quot; have been developed intoregular &quot; town holidays &quot;, which now usually last a fortnight in the summer and are supplemented by &quot; Little Wakes&quot;&apos;. lasting from one to three days, inSeptember and early October. In many of these places, most businesses areclosed, and even normal services are very limited. These &quot;town holidays&quot;secure that most people in any one of these towns are free to take holidays atthe same time. But, besides providing for their local convenience in this way,these towns have also over the years evolved fairly complete arrangementsfor the &quot; staggering&quot; of the local holiday dates of the towns which are members of the scheme. The broad principles of the arrangement are that not more than one or, at the most, two of the large centres should choose thesame dates, and that the smaller towns should also spread their dates, with provision that as far as possible these should be the same for those which areadjacent to each other. The scheme has been developed gradually, and the dates for each town are now fairly constant from year to year, though it isunderstood that the Local Authorities concerned still meet annually to fix the dates and agree upon necessary adjustments. The result is that for over100 towns, with a total population of about 2-8 million, there is almost an even spread of holiday dates over the whole period from the last week of june to nearly the end of August.21. The practice of having a more or less officially recognised &quot;townholiday &quot; has spread, mainly in recent years, to other parts of England andWales, though it is practically non-existent in and around London and isstill rare in the South generally. Some 275 towns in England and Wales,besides the &quot; Wakes Week&quot; towns, which have some sort of recognisedholiday period, mostly of two weeks, are known to the British Travel andHolidays Association. The total population of these towns is over 11 million,and over 40 of them each have a population of more than 100,000. In thecase of these newer &quot; town holidays &quot; the degree of observance in each townprobably varies widely, and in some cases may be small. The choice of datesfor them seems often to have been simply a reflection of what happened to bethe practice of important local firms, though, as pressure for their gmeralobservance increases, other firms in the area are constrained to conform tothem. But, in contrast to the cotton towns, there has been little or no attempt at co-ordination between different towns. The result is an extreme degree of concentration at the end of July and the beginning of August.22. The system of &quot; town holidays &quot; is widely adopted in Scotland. Allthe larger burghs with &quot; town holidays &quot; have their holidays in the six weeksbetween the beginning of July and the middle of August. But because of the weight of population in the cities and the industrial west, the spread of &quot;townholidays &quot; -is not even and there is heavy concentration in the second halfof July. Indeed, the towns with holidays at the end of July, and theirsurrounding areas, probably include over a third of the total population of 
Scotland and although many of the inhabitants of these towns do not in facttake their holidays during the official &quot; town holiday &quot; period, it is the practiceof most industrial firms to close at that time.Bank holidays23. Another factor commonly suspected of influencing holiday dates isthe timing of the two summer Bank Holidays. The Social Survey confirmsthat the contribution Bank Holidays make to the holiday peaks is principallyin the day trips, weekend and extra holidays that they generate. Few people whose main holiday covered August Bank Holiday deliberately chose it forthis reason, and of the whole sample interviewed, only 6 per cent thought thata change of dates for the Bank Holiday would affect their main holiday plans.But more than a fifth of those who took no holidays, except day trips, went outon August Bank Holiday, and with those taking short holidays this representedan extra 3 million people superimposed on the even greater number already taking or travelling to their main holiday. Whitsun is an even more populartime for day trips and short holidays the Social Survey suggests that in 1960these totalled at least 5  million but these are superimposed on a much smaller volume of main holiday business.24. In Scotland, although the first Monday in August is a Bank holidayas in England, very few towns observe it as a public holiday. There is noWhitsun Bank Holiday, the banks being closed on the first Monday in Mayinstead, and the only Bank Holiday, which is also a public holiday throughoutScotland, is New Year&apos;s Day. Each Scottish burgh normally fixes the dates of its own public holidays and these vary from town to town and do notnecessarily coincide with the statutory Bank Holidays. There, is therefore no single national public holiday occurring at the peak of the holiday season.Does this pattern meet holiday-makers&apos; wishes?25. When the people interviewed by the Social Survey were asked whatperiod they would prefer for a holiday if completely free to choose, June was by a long way the most popular month. 37 per cent gave it a clear preference(43 per cent of those who actually went on holiday) as against 22 per cent for August, 20 per cent July, and 16 per cent September. Contrast this with what actually happened only 16 per cent of holiday-makers actually wenton holiday in June, and about 8 per cent in September as against over 60 percent in July and August. More than a third of those who went in July orAugust would have preferred a different date, as compared with only a small proportion of those who went in June or September.Preferred month for holiday Actual month for holiday50%40%30%20%10%June   July  Aug.

26. Too much weight must not be attached to answers to a hypotheticalquestion, but it certainly looks as if the institutional pressures which produce the present concentration in July and August do so contrary to the real wishes of many holiday-makers. With greater freedom, it would be reasonable to expect a considerable shift in holiday dates, mostly towards June, sometowards September, and probably also out of the main peak period into earlierJuly or later August, although this was not directly covered by the social survey enquiry. Theoretically, the answers suggest that complete freedomof choice would give an even greater peak in June than the existing peakin July and August, but this does not seem to be a practical danger in the foreseeable future.Measures which might ease the problems27. The foregoing analysis suggests a number of steps that could betaken in different spheres to encourage people to stagger their holidays:(i) In the educational field a most important contribution to easing theproblem could be made by bringing forward the dates for the GeneralCertificate of Education examination to ensure that the examinationwas over, at the latest, by the end of June. There would beadministrative difficulties about this which might be insuperable if aWhitsun break fell in the middle of the examination period. But ifthese could be overcome, the change would allow individual schoolsor areas to stagger their breaking-up if they wished at any time fromthe beginning of July. It is the general view of those concerned witheducation that a more radical change in the school year, such as theintroduction of a four-term year, would not be generally practicable.It might perhaps be possible in some areas for primary schools tointroduce a modified form of four-term year so that families withprimary school children would be free to go on holiday in early Juneas well as in the later summer; this would however create difficulties for families with children at both primary and secondary schoolsunless there was a period of overlap;(ii) In the industrial sector it would help considerably if more firms useda rota system for holidays, and there was a greater effort than atpresent to avoid bunching holidays at the peak. In those cases wherethe nature of a business makes a closure system essential, firms might consider moving their closure dates away from the present peak, or working out staggering arrangements with other firms. Employerscould also help by enabling their staff to start and finish holidays inthe middle of the week. It will be seen that these measures would onlybe effective if combined with changes in the school holiday pattern,an extension in the resort-season, and a greater willingness on thepart of hotels and boarding houses to accept mid-week bookings.(iii) On town holidays there seems to be room for more co-co-ordination between some of the Local Authorities concerned, aim:d at producing a more even spread from June to September. The system followed inthe North might provide a pattern. But some quarters believe thatthe importance of town holidays is diminishing, and it is possible that action in this sector might have only a limited effect.9
(iv)\ Greater financial inducements might persuade more people to avoidpeak periods. The scope for this is probably fairly limited, since thereare already differential fares in many cases for off-peak travel, andgraduated out-of-season charges at hotels. The resorts would also have to be prepared to provide an extended full-scale programmeof entertainment throughout a longer season.(v) Where transport is concerned, the present concentration of holidaytravel at the week-ends is at least as objectionable as the seasonalpeak. Obviously nothing can be done to reduce the day-trip andweek-end travel that takes place on Saturdays and Sundays, but where main holidays are concerned hotels and boarding housescould make a vital contribution to reducing week-end peaks by agreater willingness to take mid-week bookings.(vi) A forceful publicity campaign by the holiday trades might persuademore people to avoid the peak holiday period.(vii) Bank holidays contribute to the difficulties of the present peaksmainly because of the extra day and short trips that they generateand nothing can be done to reduce the volume of this type of traffic.A later date for the August Bank Holiday would, however, removesome of this pressure from the main peak holiday period. Thereis no intrinsic reason why a Bank Holiday should be attached tothe moveable religious Feast of Whitsun. A fixed Bank Holidayfalling outside the examination period would have many advantages,and would indeed probably be a prerequisite of achieving anyearlier conclusion of the General Certificate of Education examination.This would not of course affect the date of the religious festivalfrom the name of which the new Bank Holiday would have to bedissociated.28. The initial survey by Government Departments was followed byconfidential discussions of ideas on these lines between GovernmentDepartments and a number of organisations in the holiday trades, in industry and commerce, in education and in other fields (listed in theAppendix). It was made clear by those discussions that there might be difficulties about some of these ideas, particularly in the case of the radical changes necessary in examination dates and school terms. But it was also made clear that the problem could not be tackled piecemeal. Industry&apos;sclosure dates could not be staggered, for example, if at the same time theexisting school holiday pattern remained unaltered. Resort areas could not provide facilities outside the main season until there was a greater demandfor them, while at the same time people wouid be unwilling to take off-peakholidays unless they knew they would find a full programme of entertainment.The holiday trades could not subscribe heavily to a publicity campaign for spreading holidays while so many people were tied by school and business arrangements to the traditional period. There is thus no reasonto suppose that unilateral action by the holiday trades themselves couldever break down the existing holiday pattern.29. An improvement could only be effected by tackling the problem from every angle reducing the rigid compulsions of school and employmentarrangements which now force so many people to take holidays in July and10
August, publicising the advantages of earlier and later holidays, making it easier to take mid-week holidays, and shifting as many day-trips and extraholidays as possible from the peak of the main holiday season.Conclusion  &quot; &apos; &apos; - :i.:,^;.:v , ,30. A reasonable initial goal for such a campaign to aim at would beto enable perhaps 20 per cent of those who now take holidays in the lastweek of July and the first week of August, and some of those who now goin early July, to choose some other time if between 1 and If million people would change their holiday habits in this way there would be&apos;a substantialrelief to the present strain oh accommodation and -transport!&apos;&apos; :&apos;!31. The !scope for increasing the number of main holidays, taken inApril, May or October is probably slight, though if the present numberwere, by suitable inducements and publicity, to be doubled, perhaps 500,000people would be involved. There is probably greater scope for inducingthe growing number of people taking secondary holidays to take them inthe spring or autumn and avoid the congestion of the summer months.32. Reductions in the present excessive load of travel at the week-endduring the season can only be looked for in two directions shifting thestarts of &quot; main &quot; and longer &quot; secondary &quot; holidays away from the week-endsand, since this certainly cannot be fully achieved, trying to break down thecoincidence of the peaks of day-trips and week-end travel, on the one side,and of main holidays on the other. These are at present both concentratedaround the August Bank Holiday.33. These limited goals ought to be attainable, but at some cost. Theywill not be attained without considerable disruption of established procedures,not only by the holiday trades but by organisations which are not directly concerned with holiday-taking educational bodies, examining boards,employers and so on. Their achievement will demand a concerted effort byall concerned, involving a genuine national desire to reduce the existingpressures which so severely limit our freedom of cho!ce as to when we takea holiday, which produce exhausting and inefficient conditions of travel,which strain accommodation and recreational facilities to the limit or beyond,and which in some cases go a long way to nullify the benefits a holiday oughtto bring. Clearly, very careful thought would have to be given to the implementation of the kind of proposals set out in this paper, and their inter-action. Before any decision is taken, the public should have an opportunityof weighing the objectionable features of the present holiday pattern againstthe jolt to settled procedures that would be necessary to secure animprovement, and their willingness to change their existing habits if theywere free to do so.11

recommendations. I therefore seek my colleagues&apos; approval for the publication of a white paper on the lines of the annexed draft.10. If my colleagues agree to this, I would propose to publish the white paper about a week before the House rises, when the holiday rush is approachingits peak, and to make a short oral statement in the House of Commons at the sametime. If a White Paper is to be published at all, it is important that this should bedone before the statistical and other information on which it is based has lost allrelevance to present conditions.F.
