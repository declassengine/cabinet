Printed for the Cabinet. September 1963C. (63) 166 Copy No.      gr/30th September, 1963CABINETANGLO-FRENCH REPORT ON THE CHANNEL CROSSINGNote by the Minister of transport in his Savingram No. 238 from Paris our Ambassador states:&quot; Now that the General, for his own reasons, has chosen the Tunnel, andthat this fact is becoming known, we must expect the French propagandamachine to blame us for any delay in following suit and to represent this aslack of vision, decision and a European vocation on our part.&quot;2. My colleagues may be interested to know that this view is borne out tosome extent by a conversation which two of my officials had with a senior memberof the French Embassy in London on 24th September. He, while emphasingstrongly that his views were personal and in no sense carried any officialendorsement, said that in his view:(a) The French Government would not take any particular action at thepresent time, either in following up the Report by further work on its recommendations and conclusions, or in approaching the UnitedKingdom Government.(b) On the other hand, it might become apparent that General de Gaulleregarded the United Kingdom Governments decision, and the speedwith which they reached it, as a test of their attitude towards &quot; enteringEurope &quot;.(c) While  it  was   entirely   understandable  that   the  United   KingdomGovernment should wish to learn the reactions of those interested, the longer their consultations went on, the greater the risk that they wouldgive the impression of using technical and economic grounds for postponing a political decision.The French representative thought that something on these lines might be saidduring the October meeting of the Anglo-French Economic Committee.3. I attach at Annex a report by the Chairman of the Economic Steering(General) Committee indicating what is being done to put us in a position to take decisions as early as possible.E.

ANNEXFIXED CHANNEL LINK ,Report by the Chairman of the Economic Steering (General) CommitteeThe Economic Steering (General) Committee have had a preliminary discussion about the proposal for a fixed Channel link in the light of the jointreport by British and French officials published on 19th September (Cmnd. 2137)and have decided on arrangements to enable Ministers to reach a decision on it.The joint report points to a railway tunnel or tube rather than other forms offixed link. It goes no further. There are big implications for this country which thereport does not attempt to assess, but which must be examined before a view canbe taken of the balance of advantage to this country. We must consider, forinstance, the economic return compared with other forms of investment, theamount of benefit to British trade, the effect on railways, roads and the airlines, theeffect on the Governments policy of stimulating development in the North and seeking to restrain the drift to the South-East, and the implications for our political relations with Europe. Account will have to be taken of the public expressions ofview which the Minister of Transport has invited, and Parliament will no doubtexpect an opportunity for debate.Nevertheless, the Government will be under pressure to announce their decision quickly, and there may well be allegations from across the Channel thatwe are dragging our feet. In these circumstances we considered it best to establish a Sub-Committee of officials from the Departments primarily concerned (Ministryof Transport in the chair, Treasury, Foreign Office, Board of Trade, Ministry of housing and Local Government, Department of Scientific and Industrial research and the Office of the First Secretary of State) with instructions to prepare a reportfor consideration in the Economic Steering Committee in the last week in October.This will then be submitted to the Economic Policy Committee.W. ARMSTRONGCabinet Office, S.W. 1,23rd September, 1963.
