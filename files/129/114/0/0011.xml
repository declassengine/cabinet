Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1963C. (63) 111 Copy No.    712nd July, 1963CABINETDISPERSAL OF GOVERNMENT WORK FROM london memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general a copy of Sir Gilbert Flemming&apos;s report on the dispersal of Government work from London is attached. For civil Departments he recommends that:(a) work for about 14,000 staff should be moved out of the London area; and(b) work for over 5,400 other staff should be moved from Central London tothe outskirts.Further studies are recommended, or are already in progress, and these may resultin additional moves. Flemming did not feel that in present circumstances it wassensible for him to make major recommendations about the Defence Departments.2. Flemming recognises that many of the moves recommended would entailmarginal loss of efficiency and in the speed of handling business, but did notconsider that they would involve unacceptable consequences of this kind. Wemust clearly avoid any seriously adverse effect on the service given to ministers and the public, but I think that we must accept the risk of some marginal loss of efficiency.3. I believe that we should endorse in principle the recommendations in theFlemming report. With the Prime Ministers authority, I have written to theMinisters concerned and on the whole they are content so far as a large proportionof the staffs concerned are involved. I propose to discuss the few remaining pointswith Ministers who still have some doubts about individual proposals. I havemyself authorised the Paymaster GeneraFs Office to move out of London.4. There are good reasons for moving staff out of central London and makingour contribution to the relief of pressure there. We cannot very well hope forsuccess in our general aim of reducing pressure on space in central London unless we can set a good example ourselves. We achieve considerable economies, and wemay ease some of our recruitment problems.5. Most of Fleming&apos;s proposals involve moves which would take the workeither to the London periphery or to places within one or two hours&apos; distance from London. The reasons for these limitations are compelling ones; but they donot apply to one major project the move of the Post Office Savings Bank, whichat present employs 7,500 people. The Postmaster-General will not be able todecide for some months where this large block of office work should be located,but the proposal that it should be moved well away from London can be announcednow. Some other much smaller moves, affecting perhaps 800-1,000 staff in all,can be directed towards the development areas.6. I have kept the Minister of Public Building and Works informed at all stages. The speed with which the moves can take place is in part governed by the speed with which we can make the necessary office accommodation and ancillary services available.2745THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
7. We can expect some resistance from the staff, and we must consult themfully about the manner in which the moves are carried out, under an agreement made with the National Staff Side in 1948; and these discussions must includetiming and location, and also questions about housing, transport and schools where necessary. I propose to see the National Staff Side myself. The Post Office will wish to speak to their Departmental Staff Side about the move of the savings bank; and other Departments will wish to discuss the individual proposals withtheir Departmental Staff Sides. I would however ask them to hold their handuntil I have seen the National Staff Side. I will let my colleagues know when I havedone so. When Departmental Staff Sides are seen, they should not be shown thereport, but they could be given the broad outlines if this was necessary to convince them that all Departments had been looked at fairly. I hope that each department will put all the Flemming proposals which affect that Department to their staff side, even though the Department itself may have reservations about some of theseproposals. The usual Estacode provisions about allowances for transfer grants andremoval expenses will of course be applied.8. We are here dealing with Government offices. In parallel the Location of offices Bureau aims to persuade private commerce and industry to take their operations outside London. I suggest that the nationalised industries likewiseshould be invited to consider moving some of their work out of London: I think we owe it to the Civil Service and to private commerce and industry to bringsome pressure on them.9. I ought to make a statement in the House of Commons about theFlemming report before the summer recess, but after the first round of consultationsreferred to in paragraph 7. I should like authority to make a statement on thelines of the draft at Annex, after the consultations referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8above have taken place.Conclusion10.   I ask my colleagues:(a) to give approval in principle to the Flemming report;(b) to approve the draft statement in the Annex to this paper;(c) to invite the Ministers concerned with the nationalised industries to approach them on the lines indicated in paragraph 8;(d) to agree that I should discuss with the Ministers concerned the pointsoutstanding on the Flemming report.J. A. B.-C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,1st July, 1963.
annex draft statement in answer to a Question by my hon. and gallant friend, the Member forCarshalton on 25th February, I explained that Sir Gilbert Flemming had beenasked to undertake a comprehensive review of the work Of GovernmentDepartments located in London and to make recommendations as to which ofthem might be moved from London, in whole or in part. Sir Gilbert Flemminghas now completed his review. The working out of the detailed programme will depend on further discussions on timing and location; but the House will wishto know the broad outlines of how we propose to carry this forward.First, agreement has been reached in principle to move out of London thePost Office Savings Bank, which employs 7,500 people. Secondly, we envisage anumber of smaller moves affecting various Departments under which, in total,some [6,000] staff would be moved out of London; included here are moves whichwould group together staff doing similar work, for example accounts or statistics,where the units would be too small to function on their own. Thirdly, we contemplate moving some [5,000] staff from the centre of London to the periphery.These measures will be in addition to the settled plans which already existed for moving some 7,000 staff out of London. Of a total of some 133,000 staff inthe headquarters of Government Departments, about 31,000 are already out ofLondon. The plans already agreed, and those which I have announced to-day,will bring this total up to about [56,500].A number of other possible moves have been suggested, but these require futher study.Sir Gilbert Flemming felt himself precluded from making any majorrecommendations affecting the Defence Departments in view of the forthcomingdefence reorganisation; but the possibility of dispersing some of the staffs away from central London will not be lost sight of in the course of that reorganisation.Most of the moves, for reasons of efficiency, will be either to the Londonperiphery or to places within reasonable access from London. But there is noreason why the Post Office Savings Bank should be kept close to London; and on present plans it should be possible to move 800-1,000 staff from other Departmentswell away from London.For a number of reasons the programme of dispersal will necessarily bespaced out over a number of years. There will be need to consult staff associations and local authorities about the destinations to be chosen and other detailedmatters; and time will be needed to acquire sites and build the necessaryaccommodation. We shall hope to find volunteers for the moves from London;and, as far as possible, we shall recruit staff in the new areas. We regard it as essential to do everything possible to avoid, or reduce, individual hardship, andthe operation is bound to take time.Concurrently, my right hon. friends who are responsible for relations withthe nationalised industries will be inviting them to consider moving some of their work out of London.The Government are grateful to Sir Gilbert Flemming; his advice, which in broad outline we accept, will enable us to make a vigorous and sensible move forward in locating such work out of London as we can, with full regard to theneeds to maintain the service given to Parliament and to the public and to avoidhardship to individuals.
dispersal of Government WorkReport bySir Gilbert Flemming, K.C.B.
Dispersal of Government WorkReport by Sir Gilbert Flemming, K.C.B.introduction. Paragraph 23 of the White Paper on London (Cmnd. 1952) put the staff employed on headquarters work of the Civil Service at about 125,000. Alreadysome 25,000 of these were working outside London and plans were in hand to movea further 7,000, leaving about 93,000 for me to review. The actual figures broughtto my notice have been slightly different: total about 133,000; already outside london some 31,000;* plans for moving 7,000* in hand, leaving about 95,000 forme to review, as follows:I.   Post Office   ..................      14,000II. Ministry of Public Building and Works (excludingLondon local work), Stationery Office, central office of Information    ............       9,000III. Other Departments with staffs of 700 or more onheadquarters work (except the Defence group and Ordnance Survey)    ............     40,000IV. Ministry of Defence, Admiralty, Air Ministry,War Office, Ministry of Aviation       ......     26;000V.   Smaller   Departments   and   Offices   (includingOrdnance Survey) ...      ...      ...      ...       600095,000I have shown the number of staff for each Department included in this total atthe head of the paragraphs dealing with individual Departments.2. I have in addition considered the staffs of a few London regional offices(see Appendix B), but apart from this I have concerned myself only with the dispersal of work that would remain headquarters&apos; work, even if it were carriedon at some distance from the present headquarters. Devolution of work from aheadquarters organisation to regional offices or the like is important in its own right, and when it is practicable has the incidental effect of reducing staff requiredin London. I have mentioned several possibilities that have come to my notice, butI have not normally regarded it as part of my job to make specific recommendationsof this kind, as dispersal would not be the prime consideration affecting any decisionon them.3. For calculating the numbers quoted in paragraph 1 &quot; London &quot; means the London Civil Service pay area within a radius of 16 miles from Charing Cross,including Watford and Mottingham, for example. I have been concerned to suggestwork to be moved right away from &quot; London &quot; in this sense, and also, in some cases,from central London to the outskirts. Except for reconciling figures I have nottreated the 16 miles circle as having any special significance, i.e., I have not suggestedmoves from just inside it to a small distance outside it merely to increase my scoreof moves &quot; away from London &quot;. Where a Department already has dispersedheadquarters work I generally recommend sending further work to the samelocation. Otherwise, I have not suggested precise destinations for work to be moved, but general possibilities, e.g., &quot; periphery of London &quot;, &quot; a centre within two hours&apos; travelling time of London &quot; or &quot; anywhere having good communications with London &quot;. The sort of factors I have regarded in determining the range ofdispersal in each case are the extent to which responsible officers would need to travel between central London and the dispersed unit; the extent to which suchunits recommended for dispersal could be treated as independent units for staffingpurposes; the volume of files and other papers which would have to pass betweenthe central headquarters and the dispersed unit, and the amount of time that couldbe allowed for such movement.* Appendix A gives details.CONFIDENTIAL2537 p*
4. My search for units for dispersal sometimes leads me to suggest movinga piece of work, e.g., routine accounting, employing too small a staff to form a workable detached unit. I have therefore recommended that several offices shouldbe established on the London periphery, and in different directions from the centre,in which such small detached units could be accommodated together. where appropriate, these groups might be managed as single units.5. I describe work to be moved in terms of the number of staff employed,but this does not show how far staff would be required to move with it. Theextent to which it will be necessary to rely on such movement as distinct from local recruitment will vary from case to case.6. I have not tried to estimate the cost of my separate recommendations, butexperience suggests that they need not lead to any appreciable increase in recurrent expenditure, while in many cases there should be considerable eventual savings.To set off against increased expenditure on telecommunications or staff travel oron small increases of staff there should normally be savings on office rents and,for moves out of the London pay area, in staff salaries. I have not normallysuggested moves which would require unusually heavy capital expenditure; but apart from such special cases I have assumed that, if dispersal is considered desirable and important, it will be thought worthwhile to meet any initialexpenditure needed for the movement of staffs, housing and the erection of offices.7. I have also assumed that it will be thought right to tolerate some loss in efficiency or in the speed of handling business. I do not think that my recommendations need have any serious effects, but most of them would be likelyto cause some marginal loss of this kind; dispersals which would not have this effect have mostly been carried out already. Certainly some of my recommendationsmight well lead to slight delays in obtaining information for answering parliamentary questions, or in the speed of some service given to the public. Good communicationscan never entirely take the place of personal contacts or the availability at the centre of all written records. There may also be some difficulties in securing goodmanagement control of dispersed offices, especially where the number of staff is small.8. I have tried to apply the same standards throughout and can not therefore recommend any of my proposed moves as in themselves more urgently desirablethan others. I have in some cases noted particular dates as appropriate, but evenif all my proposals were accepted in principle at once many factors would tend tospace out their execution over a number of years. In many cases time will be needed to acquire sites and build the necessary office accommodation; in some, specialphasing will be needed to keep the work going; in all cases there will need to betime for consultation with the staff about the planning of moves and, so far as is reasonably possible, about the destinations to be chosen. But co-ordination will be needed in planning a comprehensive programme of moves and this will necessarilylimit the freedom of choice in particular cases.9. A statistical summary of the recommendations I have made in the following sections of the report is given in Appendix C.I.   The Post Office10. Over and above the devolution of responsibility to regions much hasbeen done since the war to move substantial blocks of headquarters work away from London, as the following figures show:Post Office staff on headquarters workAlready out of London (see Appendix A)       ...... 6,200Moves planned (see Appendix A)        ......... 5,300Due to remain in London after these moves:Savings Department    ...... 7,500Other staffs      ......... 6,80014,30025,800
Of the 6,800 &quot; other staffs &quot; the Post Office plan to house about 3,500 in a new building at St. Martkfs le Grand by about 1970, and are considering the possibilityof housing the remainder, about 3,300, some 5 to 10 miles away from the City. i recommend that this short-range dispersal should be carried out as soon as possible.Apart from other advantages, if suitable buildings could be found at two or threesites in the suburbs, this would make it possible to give up expensive leasedbuildings in the City before 1970. The staffs to be dispersed under this headwould form part of the staffs concerned with the operation of the main Post office services, or with related technical activities. Their dispersal would raise rather different problems from those raised by the dispersals already carried out, andwould undoubtedly throw some new burdens on the individuals mainly responsiblefor maintaining liaison with headquarters, and on those who, though dispersed,would continue to have other frequent contacts with central London. But such difficulties in some degree are inseparable from any dispersal of this kind.11. The work of the Savings Bank Division of the Savings Department doesnot need to be done in or near London. The introduction of computers mayreduce the staff by some 2,000, but this would still leave about 5,500 and it wouldbe a major operation to move a unit of this size, especially if this were to be doneover a period while computers were being introduced. Without a statement of intention to move the Savings Bank Division on a timetable that can be publiclyjustified, I do not think that anyone will take the Governments dispersal policyseriously, but there are too many technical factors involved for me to make a usefulrecommendation as to place and timing. I have therefore suggested that the PostOffice and the Departments concerned should consult together at once to considerpossible destinations for the Savings Bank Division and to study the question of timing, especially as affected by the introduction of computers. These studies arein progress.II.   Common Service Departments12. I treat these as a group because most of their staffs are engaged on workancillary to that of other Departments. In this section, and in Sections III and Vof the report, I have dealt with Departments in order of size, i.e., according to thenumber of headquarter staff in London coming within my review (see paragraph 1).Ministry of Public Building and Works (5,900 staff)*13. Apart from the devolution of responsibility to local or regional staffsvirtually all the strictly headquarters work of this Ministry has hitherto beencarried out in London. The Ministry has recently had its general policyresponsibilities considerably increased and has also taken over the worksorganisation of the three Services. It is now engaged on the task of internalreorganisation and as a result I have not found it possible to make my recommendations as precise as I should have wished. I can, however, make two(inn recommendations, (a) that the work of the Accounts Division (500 staff) shouldbe moved to a town within a travelling time of an hour or so from London, and(b) that a substantial part of the work of the Supplies Division, which has a totalstaff of 845, should be moved to a location in the Home Counties with good access to central London.14. I cannot be so precise in my consideration of the staff of some 3,000now engaged in the design and control of new works services costing over  10,000.The Department is now considering not only how to make a reality of the transferof responsibility from the Service Departments, but to what extent work in thissphere can be decentralised to regions. This is clearly the right approach and shouldby itself lead to some reduction in the staff employed in London. But when this hasbeen settled, there will still be the question how far all the work that is to remainheadquarters as distinct from regional work needs to be carried out in London andI suggest that this should be further examined as soon as possible.* I have omitted from my review some 2,000 staff directly engaged on local London work andscattered throughout London as their work requires.2537b* 2
H.M. Stationery Office (1,700 staff)15. Under existing approved plans the Stationery Office is moving over 500staff of its Duplicating Division to Basildon. When this move has been completed,probably in 1964,1 recommend that a substantial part of the work of the Accounts,Contracts, Establishments and Organisation, Supplies and Printing and BindingDivisions, together with part of the Inspection, Transport and Warehouse Division,should be moved to a location beyond the north-west periphery of London but within easy access of central London. I estimate that work involving over 850 staffcould be dispersed from the London area in this way. I recommend further thatthe Office&apos;s works at Edinburgh and Manchester should be developed in order toreduce as far as possible the amount of printing work requiring to be done on thePresses in London.Central Office of Information (1,200 staff)16. I do not recommend dispersing any of the main body of the work of thisDepartment since it needs close links on the one hand with the client departments and on the other with newspapers, radio and television and other informationoutlets, which tend to be concentrated in London. I recommend that the AccountsBranch, which has a staff of 30, should be moved to the periphery.III.   Other Departments employing headquarters staffs of 700 or more17. The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance has headquarters staffs of over 10,000 working in Newcastle and Blackpool and only 1,350 in London.Can any other Department in this group adopt a similar pattern?18. I have not excluded this possibility from my mind, but I have not foundany and this is, I think, because none of them is mainly concerned with the directexercise of detailed functions at all comparable with those of the Ministry of Pensionsand National Insurance. In these Departments, therefore, I have had to look inthe main for relatively small units, either staffs engaged on straightforward work with accounts, records, or the like, or self-contained administrative &quot; units of all ranks&quot;. There are already many successful examples of dispersals of the formertype and it is mainly for further dispersals of this kind that I have been able tomake definite recommendations. They would nearly all involve some loss of efficiency or marginal increase of staff, but not in my view more serious than hasto be accepted if there is to be a general dispersal policy. As such units of workusually need to be in close and continuing contact with their parent department and are mostly too small for organisation as separate establishments, I have found it necessary in most cases to recommend that they should move either to theperiphery or to places within, at most, 100 miles of London, or to join existingdispersed units.19. Units of the other type, administrative &quot; units of all ranks &quot;, nearly alwaysrequire for efficient working close contact with the responsible Minister or withother parts of their Department, or with other Government Departments, or with national bodies that operate in London, or with several of these. Without suchcontacts a major branch of any one of these Departments would nearly alwayslose the whole basis of its existence. I have naturally considered how far moderncommunications can replace personal contacts, but have been able to find very fewinstances in which this would apply to a major administrative branch as distinct from a block of straightforward work on accounts, records, or the like.- 20. I have not reviewed the work of the Foreign Office proper but I deal withthe Passport Office in paragraph 68.Board of Trade (5,100 staff, excluding the Patent Office, for which see paragraph 41)21. I recommend that the Census Office at Eastcote, which employs over 500staff, should be moved to a centre within two hours&apos; travelling time of central london. This move would almost certainly interrupt the work of the Office fora period of months and need very careful planning if a sufficient cadre ofprogrammers and other executive staff is to be maintained. It would also involvemoving the Computer, but the resulting capital expenditure would not, in my view.
be significant in relation to the advantages. I am satisfied that a move is feasibleif the right year and time in the census cycle is chosen for it and that the office could operate efficiently at a significantly greater distance from central Londonthan Eastcote. I also recommend that the following work should be dispersed tothe same destination as the Census Office: from Finance Division, payroll work andthe Branch concerned with the administration of enemy property; from industries and Manufactures Department, work concerned with the management of strategicstocks, technical advice about engineering, standard weights and measures and the enforcement of control of hire purchase. This would represent about 140 staff.I would add from the Insurance and Companies Department, the CompaniesInspection Branch (120 staff) and from Statistics Division the work concerned withthe collection of wholesale prices data, the collection of industrial production dataand the collecting and processing of data on retail trade, employing together about100 staff. This would amount to about 360 staff in all in addition to the staffalready at Eastcote.Inland Revenue (4,450 staff)22. Well over 2,000 staff of this Department employed on headquarters work are already outside London, mainly at Worthing.  I recommend that in addition:(a) the Superannuation Section and the Travelling and Removal Section,employing together about 50 staff, should be moved from the establishments Division of the Secretaries&apos; Office to Worthing;(b) the Machine Centre of the Statistics and Intelligence Division (65 staff)should move to Worthing;(c) the work of the Profits Tax Collection Section (45 staff) should be devolvedto Provincial Offices;(d) in the Controller of Stamps&apos; Division the Adjudication Section and the direct Post Section (100 staff) should be moved to Worthing and the30 staff dealing with documents submitted by the public through PostOffices should be put out to Provincial Stamp Offices; and(e) the Tithe Redemption Office (230 staff) should either be moved to theLondon periphery; or, if an economic way can be found for reproducingthe maps which are used in the Office but also have to be made availablefor public search, then the Office should be moved to a suitable centreoutside the London area.23. I have given particular consideration to the possibility of moving the estate Duty Office from London. This Office employs over 800 staff in levyingestate duty throughout England and Wales. Such work does not need to be closeat hand to&apos; Ministers. But I am satisfied that, owing to the legal complexity of someof the cases, the need for their speedy settlement and the special problems oftraining staff in the examining grades and maintaining this cadre of specialists, tomove the Office from London would involve greater difficulties and more inefficiencythan any of the moves that I am recommending. I do not therefore recommendthat the Office should be dispersed.Ministry oi Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (2,800 staff)24. This Ministry already has well over 1,000 headquarters staff at Guildfordor on the periphery. I recommend that in addition 100 or more staff should be moved to Pinner or to another peripheral location already occupied by the Ministry.This should include about 20 staff concerned with statistics in the AgriculturalEconomics Division, about 20 staff in Division Fisheries II, 25 to 30 EnforcementOfficers and staff concerned with advisory aids in the Information and InvestigationDivision and staff from Establishments Division. The possibility should also be examined of moving staff out of the Divisions dealing with Land Improvement,Land Use, Agricultural Land Service and Land Drainage. I endorse theDepartment^ plans for moving work involving about 40 staff in the Food ScienceDivision to regional centres.Home Office (2,700 staff)25.  I recommend:(a) that the Supplies and Transport Division (122 staff) should be moved tothe north of England and be located with one of the regional offices of the Civil Defence Organisation;2537
(b) that 80 to 100 staff from the Finance Division and the EstablishmentsDepartment should be moved to the periphery to join staff already at Hinchley Wood; and(c) that the possibility of decentralising a substantial part of the headquarterswork of the Prison Department should be examined. If this shouldnot prove feasible then the possibility of dispersing part of this work should be further considered.26. I have considered carefully the need for the Immigration and NationalityDepartment to remain in central London. While a small proportion of the caseswith which it deals are urgent and politically sensitive, the great majority are relatively straightforward, but all require access to the same records. As things are, therefore, I cannot recommend that the 300 staff of Divisions Bl, B2 and B3should be moved, but I find it difficult to accept this as the last word. I accordingly recommend that a study should be made to* establish whether, by using modernmeans of communication, the Department could be organised to operate efficientlyfrom the periphery. Whatever the outcome of this study, I recommend thatDivision B4, in which the work is rarely so urgent, should be moved to the periphery(about 70 staff).D.S.I.R. (2,600 staff)27. I recommend (a) that some of the simpler work in Finance Division andPostgraduate Training Awards work, involving together about 50 staff, should be moved from the Departments headquarters to one of the existing D.S.I.R.establishments within easy reach of London, and (/;) that the 70 staff of the headquarters of the Geological Survey field staff for the south of England shouldbe moved to a convenient regional centre outside London.28. A majority of the Departments research establishments are alreadyoutside the London area, but certain of those which are still there could also be moved away without serious loss to the work. As any such moves would involveheavy capital expenditure, however, dispersal must wait until it is decided on meritsthat new facilities are required. A new Road Research Laboratory is already being built at Crowthorne, Berkshire, and some 460 staff will move there fromHarmondsworth, which is in the London area, in 1966. I also recommend thatsites outside London should be found for the National Chemical Laboratory andthe Tropical Products Institute, whenever it may be decided that new laboratoriesare needed.Customs and Excise Department (2,500 staff)29. This Department is in course of moving from London to Southend thework of over 800 staff in the Statistical Office and Divisions A, B and C of theAccountant-GeneraFs Department. It is planned to complete this move by aboutthe end of 1965. I recommend (a) that thereafter most, if not all, of Division Dof the Accountant-GeneraFs Department (involving up to 150 staff), the Surveyor^Branch, the Outdoor Service Training Centre and the Waterguard Training Centre(employing together about 30 staff) should also be moved to Southend, and (b)that the possibility of moving from central London, also after 1965, part of thework of the Board and Secretaries&apos; Office (800 staff), and part, if not&apos; all, of the valuation Branch (348 staff) should be examined at once. I understand that alarge part of the staff of the Board and Secretaries&apos; Office is concerned with casework, and I am not convinced that they need to be side by side with staff dealingwith policy. Equally the work of Valuation Branch, though highly specialised, is mainly executive, and does not, in my view, need to be adjacent to the Departmentscentral staff.Ministry of Housing and Local Government (2.350 staff)30. I recommend that most of the three A.G.D. Branches, involving in allabout 130 staff, should be moved to the periphery and be located with similar work from other Departments. The possibility should also be considered of movingout the work of grant calculation from Finance Branch, and statistics work, whencurrent reorganisation of the Statistical Section is complete. Further dispersalmay come from the consideration the Department is giving to decentralisingresponsibility for many planning appeal decisions. If it is decided to go ahead with this the staff based in London could be reduced by about 80.
Ministry of Transport (2,250 staff)31.   I recommend:(a) that about 90 staff from Statistics Division and up to 20 staff fromEstablishments Division should be moved to Hemel Hempstead, wherethe Ministry already has most of its accounts work;(b) that the Marine Divisions, employing about 170 staff, should be moved toa site in the suburbs having easy access to the City and the docks; and(c) that the Mechanical Engineering Depot at Hendon should be split and asecond depot opened in the north of England, thus reducing the staff employed in London.32. I understand that a Departmental Committee which has been studying the present organisation of work on the Highways side is to report shortly and willbe recommending greater delegation of civil engineering work to Divisional RoadEngineers and also, possibly, of work connected with contracts and the acquisitionof land. This will contribute to dispersal, but it is too early to estimate in termsof staff just how much work will as a result be moved from London.Ministry of Labour (1,850 staff)33. I recommend that when the time comes for replacing the Departmentscomputer at Watford, where about 600 staff are employed on statistics, finance and establishments work, consideration should then be given to moving all thework now located there further out of London. Meanwhile the staff maintaining the register of employers in Wages Councils Branch and the staff in EstablishmentsDepartment concerned with regional premises (some 30 staff in all) should be moved to Watford. I also recommend that the Foreign Labour Division shouldbe moved to the periphery, if it is decided that the Immigration and NationalityDepartment of the Home Office, with which it has close day to day links, can be moved that far.Lord Chancellor^ Departments (1,760 staff excluding Land Registry and public trustee Office, for which see paragraphs 57/9 and 62/3)34. Most of the work of these Departments is inseparably linked with the workof the Supreme Court of Judicature and cannot well be moved from London.Ministry of Education (1,750 staff)35.   I recommend:(a) that the Divisions dealing with Teachers&apos; Salaries and Pensions (240 staffafter mechanisation) and with Teachers&apos; Qualifications (35 staff) should,be moved to a location in the north of England having goodcommunications with London, and reasonably close to other similar work, e.g., the Health Services&apos; Pensions Division of the Ministry ofHealth;(b) that  about  60 staff from  Divisions  A.G.D. I  and A.G.D. II  and establishment Branch should be moved to the periphery and be locatedwith similar work from other Departments; and(c) that when the time comes to replace the computer which will soon beinstalled at Romney House, the possibility of siting it away from central london should be considered.Ministry of Health (1,720 staff)36. I recommend firstly that the Health Services&apos; Superannuation Division,which has nearly 300 staff and is likely to grow further, should be moved to alocation in the north of England having good communications with London and within daily travelling distance of the Ministry&apos;s work at Blackpool. Secondly,.i recommend that the machine section of Statistics Branch (35 staff) and work for about 50 staff from A.G.D. and Establishment and Organisation Divisions shouldbe moved to the periphery and be located with similar work from other Departmentr.2537c* ?
H.M. Treasury and sub-Departments (1,650 staff excluding the Paymaster GeneraPsOffice, for which see paragraphs 60 and 61)37. From the Treasury itself I recommend that upwards of half the staffin the Accounts Division and the awarding work of the Pensions Division, involvingabout 30 staff in all, should be moved to the periphery and be located with similarlysmall chippings of work from other Departments.38. The only part of the work of the Cabinet Office which does not clearly have to remain in central London is the Historical Section. I do not recommenddispersing this work as I understand the Section is likely to be disbanded beforevery many years, once the War Histories have been completed. Should it bedecided to keep the Section in being thereafter, its location should be re-examined.39. I recommend that the Rating of Government Property Department,which has a staff of 50. should be moved to the suburbs when in the near futureit has to leave its present premises.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance (1,350 staff)40. I recommend that some of the simpler establishments work, employingabout 35 staff, should be moved to the periphery.Patent Office (1,200 staff)41. I have given special consideration to the need for the Patent Office toremain in central London. The work only rarely involves Ministers. The office has essential close links with Patent Agents and with the Patent Bar, but in my view workable arrangements could be made to maintain these links if the mainpart of the Office were moved to the periphery. I am equally sure that any suggestion for such a move would meet with immense resistance from these andother supporting interests. There might also be difficulty in recruiting sufficientstaff in the examining grades, if the Office were moved from central London. Inany case plans for housing this office on the South Bank are far advanced and Ido not recommend that they should be changed. But I consider that the printing and Sale Branches, employing together over 200 staff, could be moved to theperiphery without serious consequences for the efficiency of the Office, and i recommend that this should be done.Commonwealth Relations Office (960 staff)42. I recommend that the work in the Accountant-GeneraPs department concerned with the awarding and issue of ex-India Office pensions, which involvessome 50 staff, should be moved to the periphery and be located with similarlysmall units of work from other Departments.Department of Technical Co-operation (820 staff)43. The number of staff who might be moved from this Department accordingto the general standards I am applying would be very small. I do not therefore recommend any dispersal but suggest that if, at any time, there is a significant increase in the number of staff in the Accounts Branch the question should be reviewed.Ministry of Power (800 staff)44. I recommend (a) that the Gas Standards Branch, having about 30 staff,should be moved to the north of England, if possible to a location with an existing Ministry of Power establishment where it can have access to a teleprinter,and (b) that work involving about 60/80 staff in Statistics Branch and A.G.D. and establishment Divisions should be moved to the periphery and be located with similar work from other Departments.Export Credits Guarantee Department (790 staff)45. Close links with commercial interests in the City are so essential to theoperations of this Department and the various parts of the work are so closelyinterlocked that I do not recommend any dispersal.
IV.   The Defence Group47. I do not recommend the dispersal of any part of the Ministry of Defenceitself (staff 1,000). In what follows I deal with the Admiralty, the War Office, theAir Ministry and the Ministry of Aviation. I deal with Aviation along with theDefence group, because I do not know what will happen to this Ministry, and inparticular to its Civil Aviation responsibilities, as a result of the general Defencereorganisation that is now in progress. The changes that are being consideredmake it very difficult for me to make firm recommendations for these fourDepartments, but I was asked to include them in my review as this would give anopportunity of considering them, from the point of view of dispersal, alongside theother Departments and by the same standards. This I have tried to do, and this approach has led me to recommend the dispersal of certain blocks of work which,however the Departments may be organised, do not in my view need to be carriedon at the centre. I have also found it reasonably straightforward to consider theCivil Aviation side of the Ministry of Aviation as comparable with the main bodyof civil Departments.48. But I cannot conclude that this is the proper approach to the main problem of dispersing parts of these four Departments. Their sheer size sets themapart. Allowing for the dispersals already carried out (including the Admiralty&apos;s4,580 at Bath) and for the recent transfer of certain works responsibilties to theMinistry of Public Building and Works, and deducting the staff on the Civil Aviationside of the Ministry of Aviation, these four Departments still have larger staffs inLondon than any civil Departments except the Post Office, the Ministry of public building and Works and the Board of Trade.* Of these the Post Office and Ministryof Public Building and Works have indeed much in common with the departments in the Defence group. Besides their size they have nation-wide (and to some extentworld-wide) operational responsibilities with related research and developmentfunctions. These Departments and those in the Defence group afford opportunities for dispersing large and more or less self-contained blocks of staff that are not,I think, open to other Departments. It is relevant that I have recommended a major dispersal of part of the work of the Post Office proper (as distinct from the savings Department) in paragraph 10 and less definitely of part of the staff of theMinistry of Public Building and Works in paragraph 14. It is not simply a matterof scale, but looking at their size and also at the nature of their tasks I am ledto ask how far it is necessary, or even best, to adopt a centralised form of organisation in which large blocks of staff are in touch with each other at many points and atmany levels. Might it not be right to carry out some major surgery and to remove from the centre some large blocks of staff and work, like that of the Admiralty atBath, though with greater freedom to choose the right distance and the rightlocation? Responsibility for maintaining contact would then fall on a smallerand more closely defined number of persons, but might be no less efficiently carriedout on that account. It would have been foolish for me to embark on a detailed study of the work of the Departments in the Defence group to see whether I shouldHeadquarters staffs in London(not all in Central London)Admiralty........................... 4,840War Office........................... 7,400Air Ministry        ........................ 5,270Ministry of Aviation (less Civil Aviation)      ............ 6,900Post Office (excluding staffs in process of dispersal and the SavingsDepartment)........................ 6,800Ministry of Public Building and Works         ............ 5,900Board of Trade     ..................      ...... 5,100Colonial Office (700 staff)46. I do not recommend any dispersal, as only a very small number of staffcould be moved without causing a serious loss of &quot;efficiency.
make, or reject, proposals of this kind, but it would be wrong to infer, from the limited nature of my firm proposals for this group, that broader possibilities of thiskind should be ruled out. I think that they call for serious study in relation to thegeneral question of the organisation and grouping of the activities of theDepartments in the Defence group.Admiralty (4,840 staff)49. About half the headquarters staff of the Admiralty are already at Bath.Provided this is consistent with the plans for reorganising Departments in theDefence group, I consider that the Admiralty should be encouraged in its policyof moving to Bath parts of its headquarters work which have least need to remainin London. I recommend that the possibility of moving out the following blocks of work should be considered: the staff of the Director-General of Manpowerconcerned with manpower statistics; staff in Statistical Branch concerned with machine operations; part of the work of the Victualling Department and much ofthe work of the Contracts and Purchase Department and of the Naval StoresDepartment. I estimate that up to 500 more staff might be moved out of london in this way. I also note that 190 staff of the Hydrographic Department will bemoving to Taunton when accommodation can be made available there.50. The work already at Bath includes not only relatively straightforwardwork such as accounting but entire administrative units, e.g., Directorates-Generalof Ships, of Weapons and of Armaments Supply. In view of this, the Admiraltyis less likely than other Departments in this group to be able to provide a largeunit for dispersal of the kind I have mentioned in paragraph 48, but the possibility should not be ruled out. The Department has been criticised by successive select committees for the amount of time taken up by senior officers in travelling between london and Bath. I cannot judge whether sufficient use is being made of moderncommunications, but I have little doubt that the maintenance of satisfactory liaison between the central headquarters and dispersed units of this kind requires fairlyregular personal contacts between the officers concerned.War Office (7,400 staff)51. Besides being concerned in the general Defence reorganisation, theorganisation of the War Office itself is at present being reviewed by the NyeCommittee. The recommendations I make are therefore contingent on two sets of possible changes. Subject to this I recommend, according to the standards I have applied to Departments generally, that the following units should be considered fordispersal: all the staff of the Director-General of Military Training except DivisionM.T.I.; the Army Medical Directorate; from the Directorate of Movements,Division Q(M)3, which deals with the movement of freight; parts of the directorate of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering and of the Ordnance Directorates; mostof the Division of the Inspector of Establishments; most of the Organisation and methods Branch; the Division of the Paymaster-in-Chief, and some of the simplerwork of the Controller of Audit and Accounts and the Establishment Divisions, C4and C5. I do not consider that much of this work could be moved beyond theperiphery. It would be sensible therefore to concentrate it in the suburbs, if possiblein South London, where the War Office already has other related work. I estimate that work for about 500 staff might be removed from central London under theseproposals. In addition, I recommend that the feasibility of moving the ArmyPensions Office right away from London should be examined. This office, whichemploys over 200 staff, is at present at Stanmore and uses the statistical machineswhich the War Office has there. To facilitate dispersal it might be necessary toconsider providing the Office with separate machines or enabling it to use anysuitable machines which may already be in the provinces.52. If it is decided in the course of the Defence reorganisation to dispersesubstantial parts of the Departments concerned, the Department of the Master-General of the Ordnance with the headquarters of the Royal Ordnance FactoriesOrganisation, employing together about 1,900 staff, might be moved away from london. As the Research and Development Establishments it controls are all inthe south of England there would be a very strong case for finding a suitable locationthere. There would also be need to consider the organisation of those aspects ofthe work on which there is close co-operation with the Ministry of Aviation.
Air Ministry (5,270 staff)53. I recomend that civil superannuation work should be moved to theprovinces and that the possibility should be examined of moving to the peripherysome of the other simpler parts of the work of the Civil Establishment Divisions.The quite separate possibility of dispersing major units of work should be examined in the context of the reorganisation of the work of Departments in the Defencegroup. In this connection, I note that keeping Personnel Branches in the centre hashad the result of keeping there also records and executive work on officers&apos;appointments. I also suggest that special attention should be given to some of thelarger Directorates in the Department of the Air Member for Supply and organisation, such as the Directorate of Equipment (B) and the Directorate of mechanical Transport, and to the Directorate of Contracts.Ministry of Aviation (7,900 staff)54.   On the Civil Aviation side I recommend that:(a) licensing work in Ore Aviation Safety Branches (40 staff) should be moved to Heathrow;(b) current maintenance work in connection with Air Traffic Control (40 staff)should be moved to Gatwick;(c) plans for moving the Directorate responsible for current Air Traffic Controloperations (40 staff) to the periphery should be pursued; and(d) once the arrangements for integrating the control of military flights with civil Air Traffic Control have settled down, the possibility of movingthe rest of Air Traffic Control headquarters out of London should be reviewed.I would recommend dispersing work concerned with the administration of civilairports if it were not intended in due course to introduce legislation to set up an Airports Authority.  This would take about 90 staff out of central London.55. I recommend that the following work from the Defence side of theMinistry should be moved to the periphery: parts of Establishment Division dealingwith records, pay and leave (60-70 staff); the Technical Information and LibraryServices (100 staff); the Central Cataloguing Agency (60 staff) and the SafetyServices Organisation (a dozen staff). Quite apart from this I recommend that in course of the changes in Defence organisation special consideration should begiven to the possibility of dispersing much of the work concerned with the research,development, production and contracting arrangements for aircraft, guided weapons and electronics. At least 3,000 headquarters staff are engaged on this work.Notwithstanding the technical complexity of the subject, and the problems ofco-ordination and financial control of research, development and procurementprogrammes costing hundreds of millions of pounds, I find it very difficult toaccept that all these staff need to remain in central London.V.   Smaller Departments and OfficesOrdnance Survey Department56. Under existing plans all the headquarters staff still in London are tomove to Southampton.Land Registry (960 staff)57. A staff of about 700 is now employed at Lincoln&apos;s Inn Fields at the headquarters administration of the Land Registry and the work of its Londonoffice. This office deals with London, Middlesex and Surrey and also for themoment with some other neighbouring counties. There is also a staff of 260employed in the Land Charges Department at Kidbrooke.58. Provincial offices have already been set up at Tunbridge Wells, LythamSt. Annes and Nottingham, employing a staff of about 1,200 altogether. these offices will grow as the work develops and it is also proposed to open provincialoffices at Stevenage in 1964 and later on in the south-west or west and in thesouth-east. As a result it is expected that the staff employed at headquarters will fall to about 470 by 1971.
59. I do not recommend the removal of the headquarters of the Land Registryand the development of provincial offices seems to me the right way to deal withthe growth of the work; but it does not seem to me essential that the headquartersoffice should also act as the district office for London, Middlesex and Surrey.I therefore recommend that the opening of the new provincial and the developmentof existing offices, should be pushed forward as vigorously as possible and alsothat a suitable site should be found on the London periphery to which the districtoffice work for London, Middlesex and Surrey can be transferred.Paymaster GeneraFs Office (610 staff)60. The nature of this Officers links with the clearing banks makes the retentionof an office in inner London virtually essential. I consider, nevertheless, that thegreater part of the Banking Divisions together with the Machine Division (employingover 150 staff) could be moved a short distance out of London without serious loss of efficiency. I recommend that they should be located not more than onehour&apos;s travelling distance from the City.61. I consider that the Pensions Divisions, employing some 400 staff, donot need to remain near London at all. If they stay as part of the PaymasterGeneraFs Office, the Divisions&apos; links with the Machine Division make it desirable for them to be located in a centre having good communications with London.But there would be considerable difficulty in managing the Paymaster GeneralsOffice, if it were split into three units as I have suggested, and there is a case,therefore, for considering some changes in organisation and responsibility so asto facilitate dispersal.Public Trustee Office (580 staff)62. The Public Trustee Office provides a service, which has to be competitivewith similar services run by the Trustee Departments of the banks, and it isrequired by statute to cover its costs. I have therefore considered that it would only be reasonable to recommend dispersing its work, if dispersal would not raisethe costs of the service.63. The service is at present provided for the whole of England and Walesfrom a single central office in Kingsway. The Public Trustee Act, 1906, envisaged the opening of provincial offices and there was such an office in Manchester for over 20 years, but this had to be closed because it was uneconomic. I have thereforeaccepted that the service should continue to be provided through a single office,but I have considered whether all, or part, of the Office could be moved to theperiphery of London without reducing the flow of business or otherwise raising the costs of the service. I am satisfied that there is a good case for keeping an office on the existing site, where it is readily accessible to those London members of thelegal profession who specialise in trustee work, and that it would not be practicable to split the Office. I do not therefore recommend any immediate dispersal of thework, but I suggest that the effect on costs of a move to the periphery should befurther examined to establish whether potential savings by way of rent would beoutweighed by possible loss of business or in other ways.National Assistance Board (570 staff)64. Substantial parts of the finance and establishments work of the Board,involving well over half its headquarters staff, are already located on the periphery.I do not recommend any further dispersal.Civil Service Commission (540 staff)65. The Commission does not have any responsibility for tendering advice to Ministers and there is no other feature of its work which makes a Londonlocation essential. While London is the most convenient centre for manyexaminations and interviewing boards, I consider that the Commission could operate without material loss of efficiency away from London. On the otherhand it has links with Whitehall Departments which could not be satisfactorilymaintained at a great distance away from the capital. I therefore recommend thatthe Commission should be moved to a suitable location within an hour&apos;s travellingtime of central London.
General Register Office (490 staff)66. The Office is in course of moving some 250 staff from its Statistics Branchto Titchfield. It is also examining the feasibility of duplicating its records by meansof micro-filming. If a satisfactory method of reproduction can be found this wouldmake it possible to disperse from London in due course many of the 490 staff dueto remain after the current move is completed in 1964. I therefore recommend thaturgent efforts should be made to reach a decision on the feasibility of micro-filming.Whatever decision may be reached on this, I also recommend that most of thework in Branch Decisions II and work in connection with the accounts and suppliesof Registration Officers, involving altogether about 50 staff, should be moved toTitchfield after 1964.Exchequer and Audit Department (450 staff)67. The location of this Department^ staff depends on the location of thefinance and accounts work of Government Departments which they are responsiblefor auditing. It is not therefore appropriate-or necessary to recommenddispersing them.Passport Office (420 staff)68. As things stand I cannot recommend an immediate move of the CentralIndex or of any of the work directly related to it because of the delays that wouldresult in the handling of urgent and special cases. I am however reluctant to conclude that on this account a large staff, most of them engaged on straightforwardoperations, should continue indefinitely in central London. Quite apart from thecase for dispersing staff, it seems to me likely that the growth in the size of theindex through the continued growth in the number of passports issued will raiseproblems of its own. I therefore recommend that a study should be made of themethods used in building up the Central Index and of the possibility, with the help of modern telecommunications, of moving it from central London. I alsorecommend that, whatever the outcome of such a study, the Provincial and PostalDepartments and most of the Issue Room that is to say, work involving upwards of 130 staff should be moved to the periphery of London.Charity Commission (250 staff)69. The Commission has essential links with legal, financial and charitableinterests which are concentrated in central London. I consider therefore that theoffice should not be moved from inner London. Nor do I think there is a case forsplitting the organisation. But I recommend that the question should be reviewedif the Commission^ staff ever increases substantially or new premises are requiredfor the office. It is impossible to foresee exactly what the effect on organisationand staffing will be of getting the Central Register of Charities more fullyestablished.Forestry Commission (215 staff)70. I have considered carefully the case for moving the Commission out ofLondon both as a whole, and in part. Applying the same criteria to the work ofthe Commission as to that of other Departments, I have concluded that it should retain a central office in London, but that the rest could operate efficiently fromwell outside the London area. I therefore recommend that a substantial part ofthe headquarters organisation, and the whole of the English Directorate, involvingtogether work for about 170 staff, should be moved to a location having goodnational communications not further north than York.Royal Mint (200 staff)71. I understand that the need to rebuild the Mint is being considered,including the possibility of rebuilding it outside London. In view of this, and considering that a decision to rebuild will have to be taken on merits and not on grounds of dispersal, I have not thought it necessary to examine the position indetail.Medical Research Council (190 staff)72. The efficient functioning of the Committees of the Council and the council&apos;s links with Ministers and other Government Departments require it to
remain in central London. But I recommend that salaries and accounts workinvolving some 38 staff in the Administrative Division should be considered for removal to the periphery with similar work from other Departments.Crown Estate Office (130 staff)73. I recommend that as the Agricultural and Foreshores Branches areconcerned entirely with properties outside the London area, and the Urban Branchmainly so, the Crown Estate Commissioners should be asked to consider movingthem a short distance out of London with necessary supporting staffs. In thisway about one third of the Office&apos;s London staff of 130 would be dispersed.National Savings Committee (120 staff)74. Although the National Savings Committee has only rare contacts with ministers, it would be extremely difficult to maintain the work from any othercentre than London. 1 do not therefore recommend moving the headquartersaway from London. But I do recommend that most of the Establishments and finance Division plus work from the Forces Division, the Publicity Branch andthe Intelligence Division, amounting altogether to the work of some 70 staff,should be moved to the periphery of London.Registry of Friendly Societies (105 staff)75. Most of the work of the Registry is inevitably concentrated in Londonwhere the organisations concerned and the legal and actuarial professions are concentrated. I do not therefore consider that the Registry should be moved from london. Nor do I see scope for splitting the organisation.Agricultural Research Council (100 staff)76. The Council would be seriously handicapped in its work if it were movedas a whole away from central London, but I recommend that part of the establishments and Finance Division with its 38 staff should be considered for removal to the periphery, where it could be located with similar work from otherDepartments.National Debt Office and Public Works Loan Board (95 staff)77. I consider that the central contacts of these Departments with the Bankof England, the Government Broker and other Government Departments rule out their removal, as a whole, from central London. But I recommend that thetwo Accounts Branches, totalling some 40 staff, should be moved to the peripherywith similar work from other Departments.Nature Conservancy (90 staff)78. I consider that the Conservancy could not function effectively withoutretaining a central office in London. Rather than suggesting splitting theorganisation, I recommend that the Conservancy should continue to pursue its existing policy of sending all the work it can to stations in the provinces.Government Actuary&apos;s Department (45 staff)79. This Department only rarely has contacts with Ministers and its links with other Government Departments are not such that a central London locationseems essential. On the other hand the Departments close connections with theMinistry of Pensions and National Insurance and the Institute of Actuaries couldnot, in my view, be satisfactorily maintained at any distance from London. i therefore recommend that the Department, which has a total staff of 45, shouldbe moved to the periphery.Other Departments80. I have also considered the headquarters work of the development commission (20 staff), the New Towns Commission (22 staff), the National ParksCommission (30 staff) and the Local Government Commission (55 staff) but see no case for recommending that any of it should be dispersed.G.

Appendix BRegional Offices1. The weight of work in regions centred on London is inevitably found inthe London area. Generally, London is also the obvious centre of communicationsfor regions in south-east England. According to the standards I have set in the review there is therefore only limited scope for dispersing regional offices.2.   Ministry of Labour(a) London and South-East RegionThis region covers the whole of Greater London, Surrey,Sussex and Kent. The regional office is in Holborn and has a staff of about 350. I consider that the work of controlling local offices throughout the region and the work of industrial relationsofficers and wages inspectors in particular make it highly desirableto keep this office in the inner London area. I do not therefore recommend moving it.(b) Eastern and Southern RegionThis region covers the standard eastern and southern regions.The regional office, which employs close on 200 staff, was moved into London when the two regions were merged nearly five yearsago and is thus outside the area for which it is responsible. Fromthe point of view of dispersal it is a great pity that this change was made, but it would not make sense to try to run the existingcombined region from, say, Reading, and it is probably too soon to review the 1958 decision on regional organisation. I can suggestonly that if it is ever practicable to reopen the matter theadvantages of getting this office out of London should be takeninto account.3.  Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance(a) London (North) RegionThis region covers London north of the Thames plus thestandard eastern region. About half the local offices and some70 per cent of the staff are in the London area. I understand thatthe possibility is being considered of moving the office, whichemploys some 220 staff, from Holborn to Wembley Park. Thiswould be a useful move. I would not recommend moving the officefarther out from the centre.(b) London (South) RegionThis region covers London south of the Thames together withthe south-eastern counties and the standard southern region. about one-third of the local offices and over 40 per cent of the staff arein the London area. I recommend that the regional office, whichemploys about 250 staff, and is at present at Baynards House, W. 2,should, in keeping with the move of the London (North) RegionalOffice, be moved to the suburbs on the south side.1   National Assistance board at present the Board has two offices in central London, employing together127 staff. One covers London north of the Thames plus the standard easternregion, and the other London south of the Thames plus the south-eastern counties and the standard southern region. The Board is prepared to considerreorganising these two regions into three an inner London region and regionscovering most of the territory at present covered by the existing regions tothe north and south of London. They estimate that under these proposalsa total of 140 staff would be needed for the three regional offices, but that two of the offices, employing together 90 staff, could be situated outside theLondon area. I recommend that, provided these two offices can be locatedbeyond the periphery, say 20 to 30 miles from central London, thennotwithstanding the probable increase in staff, the advantages would be
sufficiently worth while for the proposals to be seriously considered. should it be decided not to proceed on these lines, I suggest that the possibility of moving the existing offices to the suburbs should be examined, though thiswould seem to me the less desirable alternative.5.   Ministry of TransportOf some 600 staff concerned with testing applicants for driving licences and issuing motor vehicle and driving licences of various kinds about 240are located at Stuart House, W. 1, the remainder being in sub-offices throughoutthe Metropolitan Traffic Area. I recommend that the central office shouldbe moved from Stuart House to the periphery, whether to one location or to two oh either side of London.6.   Ordnance SurveyThe Ordnance Survey has a regional office for south-east England atKensington with a staff of 100. About 50 of the staff engaged on drawingand printing work for the Land Registry are to move in due course toSouthampton. The remaining 50 staff are concerned with the general planning of work in the region and day-to-day control of the 9 group offices and40 associated section offices. I recommend that this part of the regionaloffice should be moved to the western periphery of London.7.   Board of trade the Board agree in principle that the London north and south suburbanoffices of the Official Receiver could move to the Home Counties. I recommendthat accommodation be found for them in a suitable location.8.   Other Regional Offices in london in course of my review I have considered other regional offices in Londonthan those mentioned above, but most of them employ relatively small numbersof staff and I see no overall advantage in moving them.Appendix CSummary of RecommendationsEstimated numbers of staff included inj_____________________;_________________Group of Departmentsmoves out of the i moves from the centreLondon area (a)       to the periphery ofLondonI.
