Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1963C. (63) 148 Copy No. 0 35th September, 1963CABINETSTATUTORY PROVISION FOR SEVERANCE payments memorandum by the Minister of labour at its meeting on 31st July (E.A. (63) 36th Meeting, Conclusion (2)), theEconomic Policy Committee invited me to circulate a memorandum to the Cabinet,based on our discussions in the Committee, on the case for statutory provisionfor severance payments, and whether such provision should(i) be limited to workers dismissed on ground of redundancy, or(ii) cover workers dismissed for any reason other than misconduct.2. My proposal is that we should legislate early next Session to requireemployers to give severance pay to their long-service employees if they dismissthem for any reason other than misconduct before the normal age of retirement.The amount of pay would depend on the length of service and age of the employee.An outline of what would be the main provisions of legislation is at Annex.The case for legislation. In my view, legislation on severance pay is an essential and indeed overduestep in our policy of raising the status and security of the worker. The importancewe attach to this policy was stressed by the Prime Minister in his speech in theHouse on 26th July, 1962. We have taken the first step by passing the contracts of Employment Act, which provides for longer periods of notice for workers andrequires written contracts of employment. We now need to follow this up.4. We have already decided next session to introduce an industrial trainingBill which will include provision for the retraining of redundant workers. legislation on severance pay would be complementary to this Bill and could form part of it.It would be a natural sequel to the Contracts of Employment Act. It is important that we should not lose impetus in carrying out our policy and such a Bill wouldbe a big step forward.5. The Economic Policy Committee authorised me to discuss financial provision for redundancy with a special sub-Committee of my National joint advisory Council comprising leading representatives of the British Employers&apos;Confederation, the Trades Union Council and the nationalised industries. reported on these discussions to the full Council in July. The outcome of thediscussions at that date was summarised in a Press Notice saying that there was general acceptance in principle of the view that severance payments for long serviceworkers who became redundant were socially just and desirable and that theSub-Committee had considered the general principles involved in any statutoryscheme laying down minimum requirements for severance pay.6. There is general expectation in Parliament and the country that we will introduce legislation this autumn. The Trade Unions for their part contend withsome justice that employers are now reluctant to negotiate redundancy schemesbecause they want to see what statutory obligations are likely to be imposed.7. If we do not introduce legislation, Mr. Diamond, M.P., will certainlyre-introduce his Bill for severance pay which was introduced with Oppositionsupport in May 1962 and talked out last May. The Bill is not acceptable in its present form for a variety of reasons, of which the most important are that the qualifying3115THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENT
period is too short, the maximum benefits too high, and insufficient thought hasbeen given to the many problems involved (e.g., there is no attempt to deal with theproblem of temporary lay-off). Nevertheless, to oppose Mr. Diamonds Bill would put the Government in a difficult position having regard to the strong support forsuch a measure among our own supporters and the knowledge that the Governmenthasipeen studying this whole problem for some months. Mr. Diamond would collect the political credit and we should be accused of dragging our feet.8. In our discussion at the Economic Policy Committee, doubts about thedesirability of legislation were expressed on the following grounds:(i) The main need for the purpose of encouraging mobility of labour is toprevent hardship during unemployment following redundancy, and ifwage-related unemployment benefit were introduced it would meet thatneed.(ii) The trade unions have not pressed for legislation on severance pay.(hi) Severance payments are not yet sufficiently established as good industrialpractice to justify making them mandatory.9.   The answers to these points are:(i) I agree that wage-related unemployment benefit would be more important than severance pay from the point of view of promoting industrialmobility. But in my view it is quite wrong to suppose that we mustchoose between wage-related benefits and severance pay. We need both.Severance pay itself will certainly make some contribution to mobility all redundant workers with sufficient length of service will benefit under such a scheme but it is also urgently needed to foster good industrial relations in an era of increasing technological change by compensatingfor loss of employment and by giving recognition of loyal service. the redundancy scheme in the coalmining industry has done a great deal to ease the problems of reorganisation. In the case of the railways also,the unions have attached great importance to the adequacy of the redundancy arrangements proposed. Experience in private firms hasbeen similar. Large firms such as LCI. consider that their redundancyschemes have helped greatly in creating a more co-operative climateof opinion. No system of unemployment benefit could do the same.Moreover, there are formidable difficulties about wage-related benefits,and there would inevitably be a considerable time before they couldbe introduced.(ii) We cannot allow the pace of our advance to be decided by the failureof the unions to take the initiative. They have failed partly because etheir members will not face up to the need for change and refuse to face the fact that some redundancies are inevitable.(iii) Severance payments are thoroughly established as the practice of goodemployers and are supported by enlightened opinion in industry. Atthe same time, our experience on other matters e.g., industrial training shows it is no use expecting progress outside the ranks of the better employers if we rely on voluntary action.10. If we do not introduce legislation, we shall miss an important opportunityto improve the climate of industrial relations. We shall certainly disappoint manyof our supporters and would be criticised for failing to make the next logical move forward towards improving conditions at work. It would be fair to allow asubstantial period, say two years, between the passage of legislation and its cominginto force, to enable industry to prepare for the financial commitment and to workout schemes suited to their particular circumstances where this is appropriate. Butwe should start the ball rolling by bringing in legislation as soon as possible. invite my colleagues to agree to its introduction early next Session. As I have said,my intention would then be that our proposals for redundancy and industrial training should be included in a single Bill.Type of scheme11. The second main problem is to choose between the two possible alternative types of scheme mentioned in paragraph 1, i.e., whether severance pay should be limited to workers dismissed because they are redundant or whetherworkers dismissed for any reason other than misconduct should qualify. A scheme
on either basis would be practicable. The cost to employers of a scheme limited toredundancy would be some  8-14 million; the cost of a straight severance payscheme between  12-20 million. These figures compare with a total wage and salarybill of some  17,000 million.12. The objection to a scheme limited to redundancy is that it is basicallyunjust since it would mean that a worker dismissed because of redundancy wouldbe compensated, while a worker dismissed because of ill-health or for other reasons(excepting misconduct or retirement) would get nothing. It can be argued that theobjections to a scheme not so limited are, first, that it is getting too close to national Insurance provisions for sickness and superannuation and it would therefore create pressure for the cost to be taken over by the National insurance fund; second, that we shall not be able to resist pressure to extend the scheme e.g., to those who have reached the normal retiring age and the cost would then become a serious burden on industry; and third, that it would discourage theextension of employers&apos; sick pay and pension schemes.13. I am convinced however that we can stand firm on the essential provisions and avoid any major inflation of the cost or undesirable repercussions on national insurance. I doubt too whether either scheme will have any serious effect inretarding the development of sick pay and pension schemes.14. In my view the injustice of a scheme limited to redundancy is the over-riding consideration. Our main object is to improve industrial relations. We shallnot succeed in doing this if the scheme is going to be regarded as unfair to long-service workers who are dismissed as a result of ill health or because they are not quite so efficient as they once were.15. Mr. Diamond&apos;s Bill was not limited to redundancy. The unions can beexpected to criticise such a limitation. What especially weighs with me, however,is that it is clear from my consultations with the employers that they too would prefer a scheme covering workers dismissed for any reason other than misconduct,despite its added cost. They believe a scheme limited to redundancy would produceanomalies and arguments about entitlement which could damage industrial relations.16. While therefore it would be possible to proceed with legislation for eithertype of scheme I favour the wider scheme and I invite my colleagues to agree to legislation on that basis.Summary17.   I invite my colleagues to agree that:(a) we should introduce legislation early next Session.(b) this should be on the basis of a straight severance pay scheme and not onelimited to redundancy.J. H.Ministry of Labour, S.W. 1,3rd September, 1963.
AnnexOUTLINE OF PROPOSALS FOR LEGISLATION ON SEVERANCEPAYMENTSEmployers will be required to give a lump sum severance payment when theydismiss a full-time worker who has worked for them for more than five yearscontinuously.2. An employer will not be obliged to give severance pay if the worker isdismissed for misconduct, or leaves of his own accord, or unreasonably refuses an offer of a suitable alternative job, or is laid off for a temporary spell only and notpermanently discharged. There will be provision to prevent employers evadingtheir obligations by laying workers off for long periods in the expectation that theywill then leave of their own accord and, thus, not qualify for severance pay.3. Rights to severance pay will accrue for the years of service immediately preceding dismissal, up to a maximum of 15 years, on the following scale:For each year of service between ages 21 to 24 J of a week&apos;s pay.For each year of service between ages 25 to 29 \ of a week&apos;s pay.For each year of service between ages 30 to 45 one week&apos;s pay.For each year of service between ages 45 to 65 (60) 1^ weeks&apos; pay.4. &quot; A week&apos;s pay &quot; will be defined as either an amount settled for the purpose by collective agreement or a worker&apos;s average weekly minimum pay less overtime.5. The entitlement of a worker nearing age 65 (60 for women) will be limitedso that it does not exceed what he would have earned had he remained at work.6. Workers will be entitled to severance pay whatever their earnings, but anyearnings over  2,000 a year will be disregarded in calculating the amount due.7. There will be provision for the employer to offset pension and lump sumsuperannuation payments against severance pay.8. There is the question of how a worker&apos;s rights to severance pay should beaffected where he goes on strike in breach of his contract. The employer might beallowed to reduce the worker&apos;s entitlement to severance pay by up to one day&apos;s pay for each day or part of a day during which the strike continues. Alternatively, he might be allowed to reduce the entitlement by up to one week&apos;s pay for each week(or part of a week) the strike continues. There is also the question whether the worker should have the right to appeal against such a reduction of his entitlement.9. The Minister will have power to make loans to employers placed in difficulties by the cost of severance pay in a major redundancy.10. Where an employer becomes insolvent, the Minister will have power tomake severance payments on his behalf and to proceed against him for recovery of the cost. Debts of severance pay might be given preferential status.11. The legislation will provide for disagreements about entitlement toseverance pay to be referred to independent Appeal Tribunals for adjudication.Matters which might have to go to adjudication include amount of entitlement,cause of dismissal, refusal of an offer of suitable employment and lay-off (seeparagraph 2).12. The Minister will have power to exempt an employer from the statutory requirements to give severance pay if he is a party to a collective agreementproviding for payments to dismissed workers.13. The legislation will apply to all employments, subject to certain specifiedexclusions such as private domestic service. It will not bind the Crown, but theGovernment will give an undertaking that Crown servants will receive not less favourable treatment. Employees on fixed-term contracts of more than five years&apos;duration will also be excluded.14. The Minister will be given power to bring the legislation into operation by Order not less than two years after it is passed.NoteIf the legislation were to be limited to workers dismissed on grounds of redundancy, the proposals in the above outline would, nevertheless, be appropriate.
