PUBLIC SERVICE PENSION PROBLEMSMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster GeneralSince the end of the war there have been five Pensions Increase measures in 1947, 1952, 1956, 1959 and 1962. The last of these was the outcome of strong pressure which (so far as Government supporters were concerned) was concentrated on the question of Service and Overseas pensions; this culminated in the Resolution,agreed to at the end of the debate on the Deedes Motion of 25th May, 1962, whichurged the Government to regard the difficulties of these pensioners as a first charge on the next economic phase and to declare anew the principles which should govern the level of Armed Service pensions.2. Throughout the discussions on the Pensions (Increase) Bill, 1962, and during the subsequent adjourned debate on Service pensions, it was widely argued that the present system was unsatisfactory for two main reasons:(a) the Government did not introduce pensions increase measures until theywere pushed into doing so by public and Parliamentary pressure;(b) even when the Government had decided to introduce a measure, theycould not do so without the further delay, and pressure on parliamentary time, which are inherent in legislation.Underlying these arguments there was certainly a more fundamental one: that increases ought to be both more frequent and more generous.3. During the Committee Stage of the Bill, I undertook to consider whether some improvement in the present system was possible. I did, however, explicitlymake it clear that I was very doubtful whether any better method would be found.Since then representations have been made by a few Government back-benchers,but without any concrete proposal except that referred to in paragraph 8 below.There has also been some Parliamentary pressure to improve the relativelyunfavourable position of Forces widows whose husbands died before 4th November,1958.4. I would certainly not regard the present system as perfect. But all thevarious suggestions so far made for improving it, which I examine below, seem likely, to a greater or lesser extent, both to open the way to excessive increases inpensions and unacceptably to reduce the Government^ freedom of action in this important sphere of public expenditure.&quot; Parity &quot; of Pensions5. This, the extreme concession, would mean regularly raising the level of all existing pensions to the level of pensions currently awarded to those retiring fromthe same job. A number of European Governments have adopted this principle (orsomething very like it) and various Pensioners&apos; Associations in this country press for it from time to time. But all United Kingdom Governments have hitherto resistedit. I am sure that we must continue to do so. Comparisons with foreign practice areliable to be misleading, since those countries which have parity also have very different backgrounds of social insurance and taxation, with high rates of contribution, especially from employers. The right comparison, to my mind, is notwith foreign practice but with the general run of &quot; good employer &quot; practice in thiscountry; it would be quite wrong to single out public service pensioners for uniquely2866Printed for the Cabinet.

favourable treatment. Some United Kingdom insurance companies now offer&quot; dynamic &quot; pension schemes with built-in rates of growth in return for highercontributions, but these are only for those still in employment; and to the best ofmy knowledge there is no private employer in this country with a well-establishedpension scheme who provides pensions at current rates for existing pensioners.Finally, the administrative complications of parity would be most formidable andthe cost would be very heavy some  75 million a year at present for civil and service pensions, increasing later as wages and salaries rise in real terms. on principle, I think it would be quite wrong completely to insulate public service pensioners, some of whom, e.g., judges and retired senior officers, are on substantialpensions, at the expense of taxpayers, many of whom, e.g., those living on their ownsavings, have seen that their own modest incomes are eroded by rising prices. Thereis in my view a deep distinction in principle between the Government as a goodemployer, using its taxing power to prevent real hardship and giving to one sectionof society regardless of need, an inflation-proof status.A System of Automatic Increases6. Another possibility would be to increase public service pensionsautomatically, not by reference to current pension levels,\but by reference tomovements in some index, e.g., the Index of Retail Prices. This would assurepensioners that increases would be made in future without the need for agitation orlegislative delay. But there are grave objections to this course too. First, it would not really meet the desire for bigger and more frequent increases. It would be necessaryto fix a minimum rise in the Index say 10 per cent before pensions were increased.This would mean that, between increases, the general body of pensioners would still not keep pace with rises in the cost of living, and to propose a change which mightbe widely regarded as insufficient might invite renewed pressure for parity. Secondly,though less expensive than parity, automatic increases would mean insulating aparticular group of income earners from the effects of inflation; and theGovernment would lose control of the amount and timing of any increases, insteadof being able, as at present, to take full account of the state of the legislative programme and the general economic situation. We should also be committingfuture administrations, and local authorities, to unforeseeable expenditure. It is alsoworth noting that such a system did exist between the wars but was abandoned in1935 owing to the difficult problem created when prices fell.Delegation to an Independent Review Body7. A review body to establish the facts is unnecessary, since they are wellknown. If, therefore, the pensioners were to be appeased this body would have tobe charged with the task of also recommending the level of future increases inpensions. This is objectionable for the same reasons that automatic increases areobjectionable, viz., that the Government loses control over the amount and timing of increases. There is the added risk that a review body might be persuaded of the need to move towards &quot; parity &quot;. It is significant that the CivifService Pensioners Alliance,for long campaigners for &quot; parity &quot;, now support the establishment of such a body.An Independent Committee to Consider Improvements in the Present System8. This has been suggested to me orally by Sir Lionel Heald, who would want the committee to consider in particular the desirability of a permanent review body on the lines discussed above. Such a committee would be very likely, in response to pressure by pensioners, to recommend such a body. If we decided thatthis would be tolerable, it would surely be better if the move were made on the government&apos;s initiative; but if, as I have suggested above, we do not want it, it wouldbe highly embarrassing if an independent committee had recommended it. I do notthink therefore that this suggestion should be pursued.An Undertaking to hold Regular Reviews by the Government9. A less far-reaching concession would be to promise regular reviews by theGovernment say at three-yearly intervals. This corresponds to what we haverecently done in practice and offers a way of meeting political pressure without incurring the same degree of risk as attaches to any other device. None the less, thisproposal is objectionable in that it commits the Government on timing. This might
Conclusion12. (1) I recognise that the present procedure for reviewing pensions increasehas its defects. All possible changes have their disadvantages. But, if my colleaguesfeel that for political reasons it is essential to make some concession, the least objectionable would be for the Government to give an undertaking that it would itself hold regular reviews. But I do not recommend this nor do I assess the pressureas very severe. And it would not satisfy the pressure groups.(2) To go further than this, and in particular to deal with the hard cases,involves difficult and complex issues which have been frequently considered but these reviews have also resulted in the view being formed that the anomaliescreated would be indefensible, and that it was better to deal with all cases together as we have under recent Pensions Increase legislation.(3) My colleagues will also wish to consider the repercussions of any changes of this sort on National Insurance, and on the pensions schemes of the nationalised industries.(4) If we were contemplating any change, it would be necessary to consult thelocal authorities whose money is also involved.(5) I think the Minister of Defence underrates the presentational merits ofthe present system. In the light of the frequent improvements which have beenmade, particularly under the present Government, it can be argued that the pensioners are better cared for by having their needs watched by their formeremployers, the Government, than by any automatic system. It is certainly the factthat the increases effected by the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1962, would have been substantially smaller if they had been tied to the cost of living.J, A. B.-C.Treasury Chambers,Great George Street, S.W.1,22nd July, 1963.be very awkward economically and politically. Moreover, it might be difficult to resist demands for an undertaking that, if there was a material change in pensioners&apos;circumstances in between regular reviews, there would be a special review. Thiswould be nearly equivalent to offering automatic increases. This is, therefore, alsoboth absurd and unattractive.Particular Adjustments10. There is the particular problem of specific classes of pensioners who arewidely thought to have been left behind, and who attract special sympathy and support on that account, notably the pre-November 1958 officers&apos; widows. this involves difficulties of a different order to those attaching to finding a more acceptable method for reviewing increases in pensions and I feel bound to draw attention to them. It is very hard to find firm grounds of principle for altering thebasis of pension in one particular category of hard case which do not apply, in greater or lesser degree, to all pensioners; so that, once the basis of pension isrevised for any category of hard case, we are at risk of being driven towardsconceding &quot; parity &quot;, i.e., that all pensions should be raised to the level of thosecurrently awarded to people retiring from the same job (paragraph 5). I am sure that it would be wrong to embark on a major change in our policy for increasingpensions, in order to do something for the hard cases, without a very thorough examination of all the possible implications, j----___11.   The Minister of Defence makes a point in his paper (cT(63TT3&quot;77^Vparagraph 7) about the non-application of Pensions Increase to Public Service   &quot;Xpensioners while they are under 60. (They of course get the full increase on       \reaching 60.) The reason for this rule is simple. Under 60 there is no reason whya service pensioner should not take up work, and more than compensate for        jany erosion of his pension by way of the high level of to-day&apos;s earnings. The rule       ,is in fact more generous than the National Insurance one, which assumes that he     /will work until 65. If there is a breakdown in health the public service pensioner /receives the increase regardless of ageAJb or example, if we g?ve increases unrelated773 their pensions to certain retired officers, we should be bound to consider other ranks retiring at the same time with no pension at all.
