(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO,   60RURAL, BUS services memorandum by the.Minister^j^ Housing and Local Governmentand Minister for, Welsh AffairsThe, Problem in WalesAs Minister for Welsh Affairs I am concerned particularlyabout the situation in the five counties of central Wales, whichtogether form the largest single area of very sparse population, andof continuing depopulation, in England and Wales,    I agree fully withthe Minister of Transports view that the erosion of rural bus serviceshas caused a degree of inconvenience and hardship which cannot be ignored, even though only a minority of the rural population is seriously affected and that minority will steadily become still smaller as the already remarkably high proportion of car-owning households increasesfurther;    and I agree with him also that some action should be initiatedwithout further delay.    But I am not convinced that the remedy he proposes is the right one.2.      There are considerable risks in starting a system of subsidies for bus services, through any channel,    Mid-Wales for example is served, not only by small, independent companies operating whollywithin it, but also by out-lying routes of big companies operating mainly in the more thickly populated parts of the South or North.    Each ofthe other eight counties of Wales and Monmouthshire, including theheavily industrialised counties of Glamorgan and Monmouth, haveextensive rural areas.    It might prove impossible to confine subsidy to the most seriously a-ffected areas, and to avoid having to subsidiseunremunerative services even in substantially industrialised areas, withan end to cross-subsidisation within the large bus companies.Possible Objections to the Use of County Councils as Agents3.     But even if we decided to take these risks the role it issuggested that the county councils should play seems to me open to considerable objection.    One would properly see objections to meetingfrom the Exchequer the full cost of subsidy paid by Local Authorities,but there would certainly be strong resistance by Authorities to anyadded burden on the rates for this purpose, especially by the fivecounties of Mid-Wales, which are very sensitive about the problem ofdepopulation there and are urging action and special financial assistance by the Government to deal with that.    Relying on the Rate DeficiencyGrant, even in these areas where the percentage is very high, would leave a substantial proportion cf the cost to be borne on the rates,-1-C. (63) 16320th September, 1963CABINET
varying, at present, from about 26 per cent in Montgomeryshire toabout 42 per cent in Breconshire.    In some other counties it would bestill higher - for example 65 per cent in Monmouthshire.    CountyCouncils would, moreover, require to set up new administrative machinery, or at least have to master some new techniques, to deal in an unfamiliar kind of business, and there might be troublesomeproblems for them in the simple fact that many bus services cross countyboundaries.    Finally, if the Local Authorities were to play willingly,they might under local pressures be too often disposed to take theeasy way out by granting subsidy unwisely.4. I must at least urge very strongly that there should be prior consulation with the County Councils Association before any public announcement is made.The_.Sea.rch.for Practical.Solutions,5.      There is a strong belief in my Welsh Office that the problem ofinadequate transport services in rural areas might be solved, withoutthe need for subsidy, by relaxations in the licensing control of passenger transport to &quot;set the small man free&quot;, and by vigorouslocal effort to organise local services based on the Minibus, smallvehicles transporting both goods and passengers and the private car,instead of the 20 or 30 seater bus which, often with only a tinyhandful of passengers, may even be said to be incongruous in the countryside today.     This may well be so, but it is in the nature ofthings impossible to be sure in advance that such ideas would reallywork.    One can only find out by trying them;  and we might well find that the effect, for example, of setting the small man free to operatemore or less as he chose would be to accelerate the withdrawal ofthe services of larger companies.    I know that the Minister ofTransport fears that this would be so.    It might not matter if thesmall man services fully met the need.    But, if they did not, weshould be worse off than before.6.      The attractions of the idea of trying to meet any real need by a vigorous stimulation of community self-help are nevertheless so great that I have been tempted to suggest an experiment in, say, one (ormore) of the counties of Mid-Wales, under the joint auspices of theMinistry of Transport, my Welsh Office and the County Council(s),with an Exchequer grant made available to cover the cost of anysubsidy found in fact to be necessary.    Getting to grips with the task,and actually testing ideas, might produce some imaginative andfruitful expedients, and bring about a healthy change in attitudes inthe rural areas.conclusion.     I recognise that to experiment without the money to subsidise ifnecessary might fail to produce a solution and simply add to theirritation caused by the long drawn out process of enquiry withoutaction;  and to provide money for an experiment might commit us inadvance further than we ought to go.    But we must surely do somethingand whatever we decide to do is bound to be an act of faith withoutany assurance of success.    Subject to my point about consultation,-2-
I must at least concede to the Minister of Transports proposal that it might stimulate the County Councils to search for realisticlocal arrangements of other kinds and so perhaps keep down the costof subsidy.    But I should still prefer that any subsidy should be paidthrough his Department and that his officers with their unrivalledknowledge should take a leading part in stimulating and facilitating the search for other solutions,8.      It is in an attempt to assess what is practicable, without committing the Government at the present time to any particularsolution and also demonstrate our willingness to take some positive action following the report and surveys that have been made that Ihave put forward the idea of an experiment.9.      What I would propose is that for a period of, say two years,an exchequer-subsidised rural bus service should be provided in a selected area - I suggest in Mid-Wales - under the joint auspices ofthe Ministry of Transport, my Y/elsh Office and the countyauthorities concerned.    If my colleagues were prepared to regard this as a possible solution I would suggest that the Minister ofTransport and I should be invited to discuss urgently with TreasuryMinisters the terms and financial limits of such an experimentalscheme and to report back as soon as possible.K.
