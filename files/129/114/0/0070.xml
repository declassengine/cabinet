NATO MULTILATERAL, NUCLEAR FORCESTATEMENT OF HER MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTS position at their meeting in Nassau last December, the Presidentof the United States and the   Prime Minister of the United Kingdomagreed to use their best endeavours to develop a NATO multilateralnuclear force, to which both the United States and the United kingdom governments would contribute national forces.   The United KingdomGovernment have assigned the V-bomber force to NATO and arepledged to make their Polaris submarines, when completed,available for inclusion in a NATO nuclear force for the purposes ofinternational defence of the western alliance in all circumstances,except where they may decide that supreme national interests are at stake.   In so doing they have fulfilled the specific obligation whichthey assumed at Nassau.2. On the same occasion the President explained to the PrimeMinister that he-also intended to pursue the formation of a mixed-manned nuclear force to be as signed to NATO and to which non-nuclear Powers could contribute.3. The United Kingdom Government have, from the outset,recognized the importance of this further proposal.   They have agreedthat the conception is one which deserves examination, together withother possible means of developing the concept of a NATOmultilateral nuclear force; but they have never given any undertaking toparticipate in the mixed-manned component although they have agreedto consider providing it, if it is formed, with operational facilities.It was in this spirit that, at their meeting at Birch Grove in July, thePresident of the United States and the Prime Minister of the UnitedKingdom agreed that various possible ways of promoting a closer association of the members of the NATO alliance with its nuclear deterrent should be further discussed with their allies, on the basis that such discussions should include proposals for a mixed-manned force without prejudice to the question of United Kingdom participation in it,4. The terms of reference for the discussions now proposed,although specifically reserving national decisions on participation in the mixed-manned force to individual governments, state that thosetaking part will be prepared &quot;to enter into detailed discussions withthat end in view&quot;.    In the light of the attitude which they have consistently adopted towards this project, as indicated above, theUnited Kingdom Government do not feel that they could in good faithenter these discussions on terms of reference which imply this degreeof commitment in principle to participation in a mixed-manned forceof surface ships, especially since the value of a force of this kind inrelation to the expenditure of resources which it would entail has beenpublicly questioned and this issue is now under examination in the context of the NATO strategic review.   Therefore, if they are to take part in the discussions it must be on the clear understanding that itdoes not commit them to participate in such a force.5. Subject to this reservation, the United Kingdom Governmentare prepared to join in an objective examination of the project in all its aspects and possible variations.30th September, 1963
