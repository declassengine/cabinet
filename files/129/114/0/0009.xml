CABINETSOUTH africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 18th June I drew the attention of my colleagues to Sir John Maud&apos;sValedictory Despatch from South Africa (C. (63) 102). They may now like to seethe attached despatch which I have addressed to Sir Hugh Stephenson, who has just succeeded Sir John Maud, summarising our present policy towards SouthAfrica and defining his responsibilities as Ambassador.2. This despatch is not intended to lay down Sir Hugh Stephenson&apos;sresponsibilities as High Commissioner for Basutoland, the bechuanaland protectorate and Swaziland, which are of course a matter for the colonial secretary. Sir Hugh Stephenson&apos;s dual role is therefore mentioned only in so faras it directly concerns our relations with South Africa.3. When my colleagues have had time to digest these two papers (C. (63) 102and 109) I will suggest to the Prime Minister that the question of policy towardsSouth Africa should be put on a Cabinet agenda.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,27th June, 1963.2732aTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1963C. (63) 109 Copy No.      &quot;28th June, 1963
*N0. j5. Confidential) Foreign Office,Sir, we 72, 1963.Your Excellency will be arriving in CapeTown two years after South Africa became a Republic and quit the Commonwealth,one year after the entry into effect of theSouth African Act defining our new relationship and on the eve of what maywell be the most difficult phase of Anglo-South African relations since the creationof the Union 53 years ago. This is thereforean appropriate occasion for summarising our policy towards South Africa and forrecalling certain principles which shouldguide you in the discharge of your task.2. The post of Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassadoris, even apart from his administrativeresponsibilities as High Commissioner forBasutoland, Swaziland and the bechuanaland-land Protectorate, an exceptionally difficult one. The Ambassador has to try to reconcilea number of conflicting interests, on someof which your predecessor recently focusedattention in a lucid analysis in his valedic-tory despatch No. 20 of the 14th of May.We must bear in mind our major economicstake in South Africa, consisting of invest-ments worth over  900 million and anannual volume of export trade of some 250 million including &quot; invisibles&quot;. Wehave to be mindful of the intimate relation-ship to the Republic of the High Commis-sion Territories, which are dependent to so great an extent upon South Africa for their economic life and whose interests the ambassador must protect and represent tothe South African Government. We have a defence relationship with South Africa,which is important to us because of our interest in the security of the sea routesround the Cape and in possible air routesacross and through South Africa. By an exchange of letters between the thenMinister of Defence and the South AfricanMinister of Defence the arrangements andunderstandings on these matters in forcebefore South Africa left the Commonwealthwere extended without change. Morebroadly, the two countries, though nowforeign to each other, have preserved aspecial relationship flowing from theirhistoric ties and the existence of a popula-tion of British speech, descent and in somecases nationality, who comprise some 40 percent of the Republic^ 3 million Europeans.3. At the same time we cannot ovelook the implications of the South african governments racial policies, both for thefuture of the Republic itself and in the wider international context. A steadyaccumulation of repressive measures andof insensitive indifference to the dignity and aspirations of South Africa&apos;s 13 millionnon-Europeans has created an explosivesituation which the Government may one day find itself unable to control. Its side-effects are already being felt in the high commission Territories, where the activitiesof African opponents of apartheid, deniedlegitimate expression in the Republic, arecausing us growing embarrassment. InSouth Africa itself the Governments repres-sive measures have not crushed non-European opposition. They have onlydriven it underground into channels ofconspiracy and violence. As Sir John Maudreported in his despatch No. 3 of the25th of January, these conditions coupled with the existence of the only industrialproletariat South of the Sahara, are idealfor Communist penetration and subversion.This has been assisted by the Governmentsmisguided practice of attacking liberal ideasin the name of anti-Communism, soidentifying the two and making Communismlook more respectable. The anti-Communistobsession of the South African authoritiesthus tends to make it more difficult to alertresponsible Black leaders to the long-termdangers to themselves of Communist pene-tration of the &quot; liberation movements&quot;.There is consequently a serious danger of mounting tension and attrition culminatingone day in revolution, from which, if presenttrends continue, a Communist-dominatedAfrican Government might emerge. for britain and the West this would be a majordisaster.4. Internationally, apartheid and theSouth African Governments policy to the related question of South-West Africa have placed them in a position of virtual isola-tion and have made them the target not only of intense pressure from the United Nations,but also of strong criticism from opinion inall Western countries. Her Majesty&apos;s Gov-ernment have repeatedly made clear bothpublicly and through diplomatic channelstheir condemnation of apartheid whichthey regard as not only misconceived in theinterests of South Africa itself but alsodangerous to the interests of the West in africa as a whole. To give the appearance of condoning apartheid or assisting themeasures by which it is enforced would notonly be prejudicial to our position in africa and the United Nations, but would also be contrary to the whole liberal tradition ofour colonial policy and to the multi-racial2732
confidential&apos;character and principles of the Common-wealth. In his dealings with the SouthAfrican Government, therefore, whetherover our own interests or those of the high commission Territories, it is essential thatthe Ambassador should avoid giving theimpression that we have any sympathy withthese policies.5. Our policy towards South Africa mustaccordingly try to balance our short against our long-term interests and see the localscene against the wider background. Onthe one hand we must try to maintain areasonable working relationship with thepresent Government, which for its ownreasons welcomes &quot; friendly &quot; relations with us and professes to believe that the severance of the Commonwealth link has actually led to an improvement in theserelations. We for our part do not wishworld opinion to think that our association with Dr. Verwoerd&apos;s Government is par-ticularly warm or close; indeed it isnecessary to make clear that we disagreefundamentally with Nationalist policies andare using what influence we have, and whatmeans we can legitimately employ, to per-persuade the Government to respond to world opinion. But we must nevertheless face thefact that we cannot go beyond a certainpoint without risk of grave damage to thespecial interests to which I have referredabove. We can expect the South african government to try to make us believe that because of these special interests we dependmore upon their good will than they onours. This leaves out of account theirextreme isolation and the correspondingvalue to them of maintaining a respectablerelationship with at least one major Power.It also ignores the vulnerability of theSouth African economy to any lapse ofinternational business confidence, such as would certainly occur if the South Africanstook action against British trade or invest-ments, or if a general deterioration in anglo-South African relations appearedimminent. How far these important butimponderable factors mitigate our moreobvious vulnerability and increase our free-dom of manoeuvre is a delicate questionwhich it will be your task to assess and keep under constant review.6. Though we must remain alive to our immediate interests we must, on the otherhand, take into account the possibility that within the foreseeable future political power in the country will pass, wholly or partly,into the hands of African Nationalists. Ourrelations with the present Government mustbe conducted in a way which will riotdamage irreparably the prospects of futureco-operation with an African Government;and our aim must be to ensure as far as weprudently can, that such a government isfriendly or at least benevolently neutraltowards ourselves and the West. &apos; r7. In his despatch No. 17 of the 16th ofJune, 1961, Sir John Maud made certain recommendations for British policy towardsSouth Africa having regard to these con-siderations. I am in broad agreement withhis analysis and recommendations. Sir JohnMaud suggested (a view which he endorsedin this valedictory despatch) that we must accept as a basic assumption that thepresent Nationalist Government of SouthAfrica will continue in power for some time,and that there is little prospect of anychange of regime as a result of the nextelections in 1966. He argued further that the longer this Government remains in power,the greater, in view of its unyielding racialpolicies, will be the damage in the long runboth to British interests and to those of theWest.8. Sir John Maud recommended that weshould use our influence to encourage thoseintellectual elements among the whitepopulation of South Africa, in particularamong Afrikaners, who question the present policies of the Nationalist Party. We aretherefore using such opportunities as are open to us, by personal contact and ininformation work, to encourage the spread of liberal ideas and thus to open the way toa peaceful transition to representative government. I recognise that developmentsover the past two years have made theprospects of peaceful change more remote.Doctrinaire intransigence on the part of theGovernment and the consequent recourse toviolence by non-Europeans has widened theracial gulf, hardened attitudes and dis-couraged moderates on both sides. In his despatch No. 20 of the 14th of May, sir john Maud gave as his view that althoughwhite South Africa was &quot; under an over-powering necessity to come to terms with itsAfricans while time remains&quot; the most likely prospect was &quot; a prolonged rearguardaction in defence of power and privilege and later perhaps of power alone &quot;. But we mustnot write off completely the chances of anevolutionary solution, which alone can fullysafeguard our interests in the future; andit is right that our efforts in this directionshould be vigorously continued.
o9. Sir John Maud also recommended that,with an eye to the future, we should try toreinsure with the non-European populationby removing misconceptions about: our-selves and Western policy by discreet per-sonal contacts with the non-Europeanintelligentsia (whom apartheid and repres-sion have largely isolated from Westerninfluence) and by expanding information and cultural work directed towards the non-European audience. In the latter fieldsuseful progress has been made during thepast year. The first tentative steps have alsobeen taken in making personal contacts with non-Europeans. Moreover as an overtdemonstration of Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfs dissociation from apartheid, the queen&apos;s Birthday was this year celebratedby holding receptions in Cape Town.Johannesburg and Durban, to which bothwhites and non-Europeans were invited.10. How far this policy of reinsurancewith the non-Europeans can be continued and developed inside Africa (it may also bepossible with less risk of embarrassment tomake discreet contacts outside the country)will be a matter for your judgment. you should bear in mind the importance of avoiding provocation to the South Africanauthorities of a kind that would endangerour special interests. But mere dislike on thepart of the Government of what we are doing need not necessarily inhibit us. Wenever expected the Government to like our decision to hold a multi-racial Queen&apos;birthday Party although in the event theirreaction did not go beyond a complaint to your predecessor by Mr. Louw. Nor pre-sumably would they approve of members ofyour staff meeting non-Europeans; SouthAfrica has under Dr. Verwoerd reached astate where the authorities regard anarticulate non-European almost auto-matically as subversive. We have no obliga-tion to accept Nationalist definitions of whoconstitutes respectable company; nor can we nor should we respect all South Africa&apos;ssocial customs, where such respect wouldcontravene our own principles or be un-acceptable to opinion in this country.11. At the same time we must keepstrictly within South African law and givelocal citizens (white and black) no en-encouragement to break it. It is no part of our policy to encourage anti-white or anti-Boerattitudes. Even less is it our policy to stimulate insurrection or violence. I appre-associate that, however prudently conducted, our information activities and the cultivation of5personal contacts may tend to encourageintellectual opposition to the nationalist government. But it should be rememberedthat we have not only condemned apartheidpublicly; we have also recognised at theUnited Nations that the situation in SouthAfrica is sui generis, that the Governmentsracial policies are removed from the scopeof Article 2 (7) of the Charter, are a matterof legitimate international concern and area flagrant violation Of the United nations charter and of the Universal Declarationof Human Rights. In November 1961 we and 96 other countries voted for a resolu-tion in the General Assembly which inter alia urged all States &quot; to take such separate and collective action as is open to them inconformity with the Charter to bring about an abandonment of those policies&quot;. In a sense, therefore, we are under an obliga-tion to give &apos;our opposition to them apractical form. The methods we employ,however, are for us to choose, the conse-quences of their employment for us to assess. Here we must be guided by the delicate balance of interests which I have outlined earlier in this despatch. It is also important that we should carry othercountries with us in order to reduce theextent of our own exposure to possibleSouth African reactions. You should there-fore keep in close touch with the americans and other friendly Powers, whom we havealready urged to follow our example by giving a multi-racial party on their NationalDays. The Americans at least intend todo so.12. The prospects of the present SouthAfrican Government modifying to any significant extent their policy of apartheidare exceedingly remote. Each parliamentary session has seen fresh additions not only tothe range of discriminatory racial legisla-tion, but also to the mass of repressivemeasures which have armed the executiveWith an array of arbitrary powers, which now include the right of virtually indefinitedetention without charge and withoutaccess to legal advice. We must accordinglyaccept that indignation on this subject in britain, at the United Nations and amongworld opinion generally will continue toincrease. We must also expect that her majesty&apos;s Government will come underincreasing pressure from the united nations and from some sections of domestic political opinion to take more positive action in the international field togive practical effect to their condemnationCONFIDENTIAL
6 COWIof; apartheid. The General Assembly, hasalready adopted by a two-thirds majority aresolution calling upon members of theUnited Nations to break off diplomatic relations with South Africa and to applyeconomic sanctions. Her Majesty&apos;s Gov-ernment, in common with a number ofother Western Governments, voted against this resolution and are not bound by its terms. . You are aware of Her Majesty&apos;governments position on the question of sanctions, which has frequently been stated.This position has not changed. Though we see no reason to confer any specialeconomic favours on South Africa wemust be guided by our own interests,as the South Africans are by theirs we are opposed to sanctions on grounds of general principle and precedent; and because wehave to bear in mind our own trade, invest-ment and defence interests in the Republic,as well as the threat which economic sanctions against South Africa would meanfor the well-being of the High commission territories.13. The Special Committee which was setup under the resolution has now begun its work and has enquired of members what action they are contemplating to give effectto it. Members will in any case be expectedto report what they have done at the general assembly this autumn when we must expect that pressure on this subject will be renewed. It is likely that the question willbe raised before then in the security council, where an attempt may be made topass a resolution with mandatory effectapplying sanctions to South Africa or atleast a total embargo on arms deliveries.We could find ourselves in the acutelyembarrassing position of using our vetoagainst such a resolution unless a sufficient number of abstentions can be mustered inthe Council. As you know, we have already started consultations with the americans and other friendly Governments to this end.14. The South African Government arealso in conflict with United Nations opinionover South-West Africa. They have show no disposition to comply with the demand in the General Assembly&apos;s resolution of last autumn calling for the establishment of a united Nations presence in the territory. Itis likely moreover that the contentious pro-ceedings brought before the international court of Justice by Ethiopia and Liberiawill result in a decision of the court adverseto South Africa. If South Africa then failedto take steps to comply with the court&apos;decision a serious, situation would arise andthere would almost certainly be a demand inthe. Security Council for measures to giveeffect to the court&apos;s decision. This couldplace us in an even more difficult position than would a similar resolution in theapartheid context, since South Africa- wouldbe completely in the wrong in internationallegal terms and the authority of the Inter-national Court would be at stake. It is very important therefore that the South african government should realise that they couldnot count on our support in such circum-stances and should take early steps to conciliate international opinion on thissubject. Representations to this effect havebeen made to the South African Govern-ment by your predecessor and representa-tives of other Governments, in particular the United States Government with whom we shall continue in close consultation onthis matter.15. The resolution on apartheid of last november recommended not only theapplication of economic sanctions, but alsothe denial by members of arms supplies to south Africa. Her Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s policy is that South Africa is entitled topurchase arms needed for self-defence against external attack. At the same time,applications for arms from the SouthAfrican Government as from other Govern-ments will continue to be scrutinised fromthe political as well as the military and defence points of view. The possibility thata particular consignment of arms might beused for purposes of internal repression isone of the factors which is taken intoaccount. In general, it will be the policy ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government to deny to south Africa arms which might readily be associated in the public mind with internalrepression. It must be expected that pres-sure from the United Nations for a completearms ban will continue to grow, and wouldbecome intense if South Africa flouted an adverse decision of the International Courtover South-West Africa. It would be verydifficult for Her Majesty&apos;s Government tocontinue to supply arms to a country whichwas failing to comply with a decision of theInternational Court.16. For their part, the South african government have been reviewing their position in the light of Mr. Harold Wilson&apos;sand Mr. Denis Healey&apos;s threats to cut of farms supplies altogether if a labour government came to power. The SouthAfrican Ambassador has told me that
although his Government do not intendany drastic steps it will be difficult now forthem to place orders for delivery after aBritish General Election. He also referred,perhaps only for effect, to the possible consequences for our understandings onjoint defence of the Labour Party&apos;s attitude to arms deliveries. Mr. Young has given a useful assessment of the South Africanposition in his telegram No. 202 of the21st of May; I shall wish you to keep thisdelicate question under review.17. In addition to your duties as her majesty&apos;s Ambassador to South Africa,Your Excellency will hold the post of HighCommissioner for Basutoland, Swazilandand the Bechuanaland Protectorate. Con-siderable thought has been given to thequestion whether the offices of HighCommissioner and Ambassador shouldcontinue to be united in one person. TheSouth African Prime Minister has himselfasked that the offices should be separated onthe ground that the Ambassador^ work inSouth Africa is likely to be prejudiced byhis responsibilities in the Territories andthat in his capacity as High Commissionerhe might be compelled to reveal his disagree-ment with the policies of the South african government. A section of political opinionhere is also in favour of this change, for the opposite reason, namely that the interests ofthe Territories are likely to be subordinate to the maintenance of good relations with south Africa as long as one man occupiesthe two posts.18. Full weight has been given to these arguments and to other considerations; for as this despatch will have made clear, thereconciliation of conflicting interests anddesiderata which you will have to seek is agood deal more complicated than a simplebalance between the good of the Territorieson the one hand and the preservation of friendly relations with the present SouthAfrican Government on the other. It wasdecided, after a review of the question lastyear, that the arguments for uniting the twooffices continued to prevail for the present.It is possible, however, that this situation will change in the relatively near future as aresult of constitutional developments in the territories. It may then be desirable to abolish the office of the High Commissioneraltogether and to put an end to yourpower of intervention in the internal affairs of the Territories. The need for constantliaison between yourself and the governors of the Territories would of course remain;indeed it is likely to increase as tension inSouth Africa and between her and the outside world becomes more acute. the governors for their part would have to payconstant regard in their administration ofthe Territories to relations with the SouthAfrican Government and to the wider considerations of developments in the restof Africa and of British and internationalopinion. No decision on this subject will,however, be taken until you have beengiven an opportunity to submit your ownrecommendations in the light of yourexperience in the post.19. I am sending copies of this despatch to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washing-ton and to the British Permanent Repre-sentative in New York.I am, &amp;c.HOME.
