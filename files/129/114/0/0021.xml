CABINETNATO NUCLEAR FORCE: THE NEXT STEPMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs attach, at Annex, a copy of a memorandum on this subject which I haveshown to the Prime Minister.The Prime Minister has agreed with this general line of approach. He considersthat action-should be deferred for the time being, until we are in a position toestimate the results of the visit to Moscow by the Lord President andMr. Harriman. I am therefore circulating the memorandum for the informationof my colleagues.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,9th July, 1963.2789Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1963C.

ANNEXIn the discussions with the President of the United States it was agreed thatvarious possible ways of meeting the problem of the closer association of membersof NATO with the nuclear deterrent of the alliance should be further discussed.Uf 2. The military, economic and technical problems will be considered in thetwo NATO studies, on strategy and force structure, now in hand. But these willnot touch the political problem which is basic to the whole question. It will benecessary for the problem of political control of the deterrent to be discussedseparately, in parallel with the other studies. This is something on which theUnited Kingdom can take an initiative and avoid the charge that we merely rejectAmerican proposals.3. Whether or not a mixed-manned force is eventually created, or otheradditions are made to the NATO nuclear armoury, the problem of political controlof existing nuclear forces must be solved. The United States Government havemade clear that in present circumstances and as long as they remain in Europethey will expect to concur in any decision on the use of nuclear weapons held inEurope. As Mr. Rusk put it, 5 per cent of the nuclear capacity of the alliance cannotdetermine the use of the other 95 per cent. But by the same token the european countries also want a say in the use of the 95 per cent. They would like to be sure that it will not be used in situations where they would not want it used; and whenthey do want it used, they would like to be sure that it will in fact be used. this can apply to situations outside NATO as well as to events bringing the north atlantic Treaty into operation. There can of course never be complete assurance,but the political problem is to meet the demand as far as possible.4. This does not necessarily mean that the United States veto should be abolished. The United Kingdom has no interest in breaking the link between theUnited States and European defence. At Nassau we subscribed to the indivisibilityof the nuclear defence of the Western alliance. Thus the demand is not for europe to have the right to overrule the United States but for Europe&apos;s voice to be heard in the formulation of policy and the process of making decisions.5. The existing organs of NATO, the Council and the Nuclear Committee,both represent all 15 members. Something smaller is needed to be able to take effective decisions, to reflect the different weight of contributions by different countries and to enable countries (such as Norway and Denmark) to contract out of the nuclear policy if they wish.6. The best solution seems to be a NATO Nuclear Control Commission,which should include representatives of countries contributing to the Natomultilateral force in its widest sense as agreed at Nassau. That is the existingforces contributed to the Inter-Allied force and any new mixed-manned or otherelement which may be created. The United Kingdom would qualify through the assignment of its national deterrent forces, whether or not it took part in a mixed-manned contingent. The Commission could be composed partly ofpermanent and partly of rotating members. The permanent members would haveto include the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and, if she wanted.France. Italy would also have a strong claim. Thus there might be five permanent members, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy,and one or two rotating members. The greater the number of rotating members,the less need for rapid rotation; but in general it would be desirable to keep the body small.7.   The Commission would operate on behalf of the North Atlantic Council,to whom it would report as desirable, and its functions would include:(a) Providing SACEUR with political guidance on nuclear affairs;(b) approving SACEUR&apos;s targeting and operational plans;(c) drawing up guidelines for the use of nuclear weapons in certain definedcircumstances;(d) instructing or authorising SACEUR to execute his plans (this would include the decision to release nuclear weapons to SACEUR);
(e) consulting and discussing possible contingencies anywhere in the worldwhich might give rise to the possibility that nuclear weapons might beused, and ensuring that the views of all interested allies were takeninto account. (This would provide a permanent organ of consultation and would be intended to obviate the possibility of further complaints,as at the time of the Cuba crisis, that the United States was taking decisions without consulting its allies in good time.)8. A Nuclear Control Commission formed in this way might in due coursecome to function as an Executive Committee for the alliance as a whole on bothnuclear and other problems. The need for some such body has long been felt in nato but has so far been opposed on the grounds that it would result indiscrimination against the interests of the smaller members. The plain need for a nuclear Control body might, however, allow this problem to be approachedthrough the back door and the idea of rotating members would safeguard theinterests of the smaller countries.9. The inclusion of Germany as a permanent member of the control commission should go far to meet the German desire both for an effective voice inthe nuclear decisions of the alliance and for a position of ostensible equality withthe United Kingdom (and France). It cannot however be denied that on many occasions the effective decisions will in fact be made by the President of the UnitedStates, normally where time permits after bilateral consultation with the PrimeMinister of the United Kingdom, and that the function of the NATO NuclearCommission will be to assemble the necessary views preparatory to the decision andto execute the decision once it has been taken. Formally, however, the decision willbe seen to be taken by the Control Commission. It is for consideration whether theControl Commission should be balanced by a nuclear authority of similarcomposition in Washington, which could be composed of the Ambassadors of the participating countries and could provide advice direct to the President of the UnitedStates. A further possibility would be an extension of the &quot; hot line &quot; telephonesystem to enable the principal Heads of Government concerned, particularly theGerman Chancellor, to consult personally together in advance of any NATOdiscussion.10. In order to counteract any impression that the British attitude to these problems is purely negative, it is important to take an early initiative. This might bedone by my attending a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, to set out views onthe problems confronting the alliance after the Nassau Agreement and the Brusselsbreakdown. On this occasion I could propose that the alliance should set up aseparate group to study the problem of political control, in parallel with the otherstudies on strategy and force goals, and as a contribution to the study of the problem should put forward the United Kingdom proposal on the lines of the preceding paragraphs. It would be the aim to finish all three studies so that decisions could betaken by Ministers at the Ministerial meeting of NATO in May 1964.11. Such an initiative by us worked very well in respect of the inter-allied forceand I think the allies might well like us to repeat the performance. No one, except theGermans, seems to be keen on the mixed manned force and a move of the kind i suggest might get them all off the hook.
