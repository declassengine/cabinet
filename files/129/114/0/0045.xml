(THIS figCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY MO.6230fch July, 1963CABINETUNITED NATIONS FORCES IN THEjCONQOMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Secretary General of the United Nations has recently been taking the line that the financial situation of the United Nations makes itimpossible to maintain their forces in the Congo after the end of thisyear.    He apparently intends to submit this question to the security council in his next report on the United Nations operations in the latter half of August.2.     Our own information from the Congo suggests that the problem oflaw and order is still extremely serious.    Although the majorsecessionist movements in Katanga and Kasai have been suppressed, theCentral Government writ still does not run effectively over the whole country.    Tri-bal conflicts, banditry and violence are endemic and areonly held in check by the presence of United Nations forces.    The armyand police at the disposal of the Congolese Government are untrained andundisciplined.      The problem is therefore to train adequate numbers ofthe Congolese forces before the United Nations troops withdraw.      TheCongolese Government have commissioned the Belgians, assisted by theUnited States and other Western countries, to do this.    It is most unlikely however that they will have made substantial progress in thisdirection before the middle of 1964.    If all the United Nations troops are withdrawn before then, there is a serious danger that law and order willbreak down.      In that case the Europeans who run the economy will leave and the Congo will revert to the situation which existed in I960.3.      We know that the United States and Belgian Governments sharethis assessment.    The latter hope to train a force of about sevenbattalions of the Congolese National Army by the middle of 1964., but have little hope of doing so sooner.    Adoula himself when he was in Londonrecently said that he thought that the United Nations forces were beingrun down too fast, and that their departure at the end of the year wouldbe premature.    He said that he was asking the Nigerians for further assistance in training the police.4.      The United Kingdom Delegation in New York have recentlybeen instructed to sound the Secretary General about his intentions.He said that from his talks with a number of delegations he thoughtthat there would be very little support forthcoming for the continuation of a United Nations military presence after the end of this year and thathe saw no prospect of the necessary finance being available.    his military advisers had told him that an effective presence required aminimum of six thousand troops, and that if these could not be main-tained then the United Nations force should be withdrawn, altogether.He added that in a country like the Congo, law and order up to Westernstandards could not be expected and that he did not foresee any complete breakdown or fragmentation of the country.-1-CONFIDENTIAL
5.      The United States Government estimate that the United nations will need to keep three battalions (perhaps a total of three thousand men)in the Congo during 1964 until the Congolese National Army can takeover their responsibilities, and have suggested that these might be supplemented by two battalions of foreign African troops, preferablyNigerians and Ethiopians, employed by the Congolese.6.     I think that there is no doubt that a further breakdown of law andorder in the Congo, which might follow the departure of the united nations troops at the end of this year, would produce an extremely serious situation.    Not only would the progress which has been made towards the reconstruction and re-integration of the country be largelyundone, but the international repercussions might be far-reaching.     TheUnited Nations operation could scarcely be remounted once the troops had been withdrawn;  and the cost of doing so would be likely to be verymuch higher than that of maintaining some part of the present force inthe Congo during part of 1964.    It is important to prevent disorder inthe Congo during the difficult period of the dissolution of the central african Federation.7.     I am very reluctant to do so but I feel I must recommend that weshould be prepared to support the maintenance of an adequate force ofUnited Nations troops in the Congo to assist in maintaining law and orderduring 1964 until the Congolese forces themselves can undertake this responsibility.H.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.30th July, 1963-2-CONFIDENTIAL
