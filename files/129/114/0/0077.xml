Cabinet Office, S. W. 1.1st Cctober, 1963CJ6j3jJJ7 COPY NO..     3 jj1st Cctober, 1963CABINETBUCHANAN report note by the Secretary of the CabinetThe Prime Minister has directed me to circulate, for theinformation of the Cabinet, the attached copy of a minute by theMinister of Transport.(Signed)  BURKS TREND
CONFIDENTIAL .       Oisfc   ijc   majesty   jjs   sjeBuchanan ReportThis is an interim progress report.2.      The Buchanan report and the Crowther group&apos;s covering report should be ready for publication by about 20th November.It will be beautifully produced and illustrated and will probablycost 50s.    The Stationery Office are producing an initial printof 15, 000 copies.     I think the demand will be greater than that.For comparison the Beeching Report (20s. ) sold 20, 000.3.      There is also to be an abridged version of Buchanan!sreport published by Penguin&apos;s - in March.     The proposaloriginated with them and is confidential.    They are veryexcited about it and hope to sell 60, 000-100, 000 copies,50 per cent of them overseas.     (There should, therefore, be some handsome royalties for the Stationery Office.)    Iexpect the price to be 6s. or 7s. 6d.4.      The inter-departmental group which has been making a preliminary study of the two reports has virtually completed its task.    Their findings will be considered immediately bythe small steering group of Permanent Secretaries who will advise us about the issues which the Government will have todecide, both for the short-term and for the long-term, and what we can say when the two reports are published.jje   ije setting
