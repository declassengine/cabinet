Printed for the Cabinet. September 1963- - - .C (63) 155 Copy No.    6 017th September, 1963CABINETDISSOLUTION OF THE FEDERATION OF RHODESIA ANDNYASALANDMemorandum by the First Secretary of StateMy colleagues may be interested to have a brief account of the progress made towards the dissolution of the Federation since the Victoria Falls Conference. Itwill be recalled that the Conference agreed to the establishment of inter-Governmental machinery at official level to tackle the detailed problems ofdissolution and a start was made on this work in Salisbury shortly after theconclusion of the Conference early in July.2. I am glad to say first of all that after protracted and sometimes difficult negotiations, an early settlement should now be possible on the terminalarrangements for Federal Public Servants, including the terms on which they willbe offered employment in the various territorial services. This settlement is designedto ensure:(a) the orderly handover of functions to the Territorial Governments and the avoidance of disruption in these services;(b) that as many Federal Civil Servants as possible should be able to continue their public service careers in one or other of the territories;(c) security of terminal benefits and functions of Federal Civil Servants afterdissolution.Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the three Territorial Governments have agreed that(i) the Federal Pension Fund will be retained and administered by a Pensionauthority and Trustees;(ii) the four Governments will share fairly in making good any deficit in theFederal Pension Fund to the extent necessary for honouring the terminal benefits of Federal officers;(iii) they will between them enter into a Central African Public Officersagreement which will secure the terminal benefits of Federal officers for the future. (The precise form of the United Kingdom association has been reserved.)Federal Civil Servants will be allowed to choose which Territorial government they wish to serve, and are being encouraged to accept in the first place voluntarysecondment to a territorial service for a period not extending beyond 31st May,1964, on their Federal salaries and conditions of service.3. Progress has also been made in identifying those Federal functions forwhich arrangements for early transfer to the territories can be made. It is proposedto make the necessary provision by Order in Council at the end of this month.4. The special Committee dealing with inter-territorial questions is at present working on the problem of joint arrangements for Kariba, the Rhodesia Railwaysand Central African Airways. A representative of the World Bank has beenassisting in the Committee. It is too early yet to say in what other fields jointarrangements may prove acceptable to the territories. As regards currency, both3164
the Northern Governments are at present publicly committed to separate currencies,and a representative of the Bank of England is at present advising all threeterritorial Governments on how these might be established. It is satisfactory to note,however, that all Governments have recognised the need for an adequatetransitional period and have pledged themselves to full support of the central bank during that period. As regards Customs and Tariffs, the advantages of theFederal system of internal free trade operating behind a common external tariffwere unequally distributed between the territories, and it is now clear that sucha system will not survive dissolution. On the other hand, the two northern territories have publicly announced their readiness, subject to the protection oflocal industry, to suspend the application of tariffs to imports from the other territories, pending the negotiation of long-term trade agreements with them. Theseannouncements have been well received in commercial quarters, as well as by theSouthern Rhodesia Government.5. I think it can fairly be said that the negotiations set in train at victoria falls have got off to a good start. There are, of course, still difficult problemsahead, more particularly on the contentious subject of Federal Assets and liabilities, on which discussions have only just started. Generally speaking, however,negotiations are proceeding in a good spirit and I remain hopeful of our being ableto carry out the programme planned at Victoria Falls and dissolve the Federationat the end of this year.R. A. B.Office of the First Secretary of State,King Charles Street, Whitehall, S.W. 1,16th September, 1963.
