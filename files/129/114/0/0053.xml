Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1963C. (63) 153 Copy No.   6416th September, 1963CABINETMULTILATERAL NUCLEAR FORCEMemorandum by the Minister of DefenceAny meeting on the multilateral force will be intended by the United states to be, and will be interpreted as being, an important step towards the creation ofsuch a force. Before deciding to attend any such meeting we must decide whether we want such a force to be created, and if it is to be created whether we wish to subscribe to it.2. The proposals now put forward by the United States extend well beyondanything they proposed at Nassau and amount to an extensive and expensiveweapons system. The.capital cost of this system may amount to around  400 million or  500 million. The minimum expenditure required of this country if we participateat all would probably amount to between  10 million and  20 million a year, forthe next ten years at least.3. I think that we should not subscribe to any such force and should discourageits creation for the following reasons:(a) it adds nothing of importance to the defence of the West since it would beinconceivable to any enemy that it could ever be used without a priordecision by the United States to use the whole of their strategicdeterrent;(b) if, as the Foreign Secretary says (paragraph 6(b) of C. (63) 151), the federal german Government appear to believe that the United States vetowill be watered down or concealed to meet their political requirements,this will gravely increase our own political difficulties;(c) the draining into nuclear expenditure of large sums of money from Europecan only have the effect of diverting European expenditure from other more important and more urgent defence needs;(d) if Germany is to subscribe substantial sums of money to this force, theprospects of her being able to implement the agreement on stationingcosts through extensive purchases of arms from this country will bemuch reduced;(e) the proposals are being pressed for alleged political objectives in advanceof and without regard to the studies on defence resources and NATOstrategy at present being considered within NATO;(/) the programme envisages the creation of a new international nuclear force which will certainly tend to be divisive of NATO;(g) the creation of such a force will increase world tension and may well resultin counter action of a similar type by the Russians. To avoid this theUnited States are, I understand, now suggesting that the multilateral force should be held in the coastal waters of America. This seems aremarkably unproductive way of spending  500 million and illustrates the illusory nature of this form of defence.4. Even if we ignored these objections and the considered views of the Chiefsof Staff that this force cannot be justified on military grounds, we should still find ourselves in great political difficulties in supporting it. So far as I can judge it has3154
no supporters, on either side of the House of Commons, and in any vote on theprinciple involved the Government, if supporting the project, would suffer ahignominious defeat.5. In the last few days I have talked with the Federal German Minister ofDefence, Herr von Hassel. The following points emerged from these discussions:f. II (a) the German Minister assured me that in no circumstances will the Germansseek to acquire nuclear weapons of their own. Neither do they intend to work with the French in the development of the Force de Frappe; -(b) the Germans stress that the multilateral force was not a German suggestionbut has been pressed upon them from outside;(c) the Germans do not support the multilateral force on any military groundsbut solely as an exercise in co-operation with the Americans;(d) the German military staffs are very worried about the implications on their military plans in other fields of the heavy additional cost of any suchprogramme:(e) the German Minister doubted the wisdom of a European deterrent aspossibly tending to divide Europe from the United States, but would consider sympathetically any Anglo-French co-operation in the nuclearfield which led France to waive her objections to United Kingdom. entry into the Common Market, upon which the Germans set a high priority;(/) Herr von Hassel said that he did not believe the Germans would do a bilateral deal with the Americans on the multilateral force. They will certainly require participation by other European Powers, and almost certainly by the United Kingdom. I am of the view that they would bevery doubtful about proceeding with both France and the UnitedKingdom outside.6. Against this background I would urge my colleagues to think well beforeadding to the pressure for a multilateral force. I agree with the Foreign Secretary(paragraph 21 of C. (63) 151) that no one is urging us to put forward alternatives.Co-operation with France in the nuclear field raises important possibilities but alsomany problems which go wider than this paper. The immediate need is to decide whether to join in further meetings on the multilateral force. I judge that we should refrain from doing so.P. T.Ministry of Defence, S.W. I,13th September, 1963.
