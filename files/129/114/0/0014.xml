CENTRAL ORGANISATION FOR defence i. IntroductionOn 4th March, 1963, the Minister of Defence in the House of Commonsannounced decisions in principle to strengthen the Central organisation for Defence.2. A unified Ministry of Defence will be set up in which authority and responsibility will be vested in a single Secretary of State. It will replace the present Ministry of Defence, Admiralty, War Office, and AirMinistry. New arrangements will be made for collaboration between theMinistry of Defence and the Ministry of Aviation.3. The object is to improve the central control of defence policy withoutimpairing the efficiency and morale of the fighting Services. Their separateidentities will be preserved.4. The arrangements set out in the 1958 White Paper (Command 476)have not in practice secured the degree of central control over defence policy which is necessary in the national interest. A unified Ministry ofDefence is essential if the Defence Budget is to strike a proper balance between commitments, resourpes, and the roles of the Services.5. Better arrangements are needed for formulating requirements forweapons and for controlling the defence research and development programme.6. In certain fields of administration the three Services have differentpractices. Economy and efficiency may in the long run be improved by removing these differences wherever practicable, In some cases a common defence approach will replace the practices of the individual Services. in others the procedure whereby one Service undertakes a task on behalf ofall three will be extended.7. The control of defence policy requires a greater knowledge of the background problems and currents of opinion within the Services than canbe secured with four separate Defence Departments responsible to separateMinisters.II. The New Approach Basic Principles8. Authority and responsibility must be in the hands of the Secretaryof State for Defence.9. The Secretary of State for Defence must have complete control bothof defence policy and of the machinery for the administration of the three services. An unbroken line of authority and responsibility will run fromthe Secretary of State through military, scientific, and administrative staffsthroughout the Ministry. In practice, however, he will delegate much ofhis authority.10. The Services must preserve their separate identities. In action theyare increasingly interdependent. This interdependence must be expected toincrease. Nevertheless all experience shows that the fighting spirit of theindividual man in battle derives largely from his loyalty to his ship, his
unit, or his squadron. The traditions and battle honours of the individual services are a vital factor in morale and fighting efficiency. This situationmust be preserved.11. Although, however, the three Services will remain separate, withinthe new Ministry work will be organised wherever possible on a Defencerather than a single Service basis.12. At the same time the new Ministry will be responsible for a budgetnot far short of  2,000 million a year, and for some 400,000 fighting men and about another 400,000 civilians. As is prudent in all large organisations itwill recognise a broad distinction between policy and management. Someof the military and civil staffs will be concerned with major defence policy.Others will deal with the management respectively of the Royal Navy, theArmy, and the Royal Air Force.13. Policy and management cannot, however, be isolated from eachother. The separation of the staffs responsible for policy (in the presentMinistry of Defence) and management (in the present Service Departments)is a major defect in the existing organisation. In a unified Ministry a muchcloser working partnership between policy and management staffs must beachieved.14. The organisation must be flexible. It must be capable of smoothand progressive development after the new Ministry has been set up.III. Cabinet Organisation15. The new Ministry will ensure effective co-ordination, under the con-trol and direction of the Secretary of State for Defence, of all questionsof policy and administration which concern the fighting Sendees as the instn-u-ments of an integrated strategy. But major questions of defence policycannot be discussed in purely military terms ; they also need to be examined in relation to foreign and economic policy, and in this wider context theyoften raise further issues which have a considerable political content. Con-adversely, our political relations with the other members of the commonwealth and with foreign countries may bear directly on our defence policy ; andthe requirements of the Governmenfs financial and economic policies mayequally affect the size, disposition, and equipment of the Services.16. These broad issues engage the collective responsibility of Ministers.Subject to the supreme authority of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet for national defence, they will be dealt with by a Committee on Defence and oversea Policy, which will meet under the Chairmanship of the PrimeMinister and will normally include the First Secretary of State, the foreign secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or the Chief Secretary to theTreasury, the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations and the Colonies, and the Secretary of State for Defence. other ministers will be invited to be present as necessary. The Chief of theDefence Staff and the Chiefs of Staff will be in attendance as the natureof the business requires. Other officials, such as Permanent Under Secre-taries of State or the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Secretary of Statefor Defence, will also attend as required.17. In addition, the Chief of the Defence Staff and the Chiefs of staff will, as at present, be invited to attend meetings of the full Cabinet on
appropriate occasions. They will thus be able to fulfil their traditional duty to tender professional military advice to the Government; and they will retain their right of access to the Prime Minister.IV. Secretary of State for Defence18. All statutory powers for the defence of the realm now vested in theexisting Service Ministries will be vested in the Secretary of State. Hewill exercise his authority under the arrangements described below.V. Other Ministerial Appointments19. The offices of the First Lord of the Admiralty and of the Secre-taries of State for War and Air will be abolished together with the Boardof Admiralty and the Army and Air Councils. These historic offices and institutions have served the country faithfully and well in peace and war;but new arrangements are needed to secure a proper control of nationaldefence policy.20. There will be three Ministers of State for Defence. They will be assisted by three Parliamentary Under Secretaries of State. The Minis-ters of State will discharge whatever responsibilities the Secretary of state may delegate to them from time to time over the whole of the Defencefield. Among their primary functions will be to execute policy on behalfof the Secretary of State in respect of a designated Service. They willanswer to Parliament on his behalf as may be required. The ministers will be called the Ministers of State for Defence (Royal Navy), (Army),and (Royal Air Force).VI. The Defence Council21. A Defence Council will be established under the Secretary of State.It will exercise the powers of command and administrative control pre-viously exercised by the Board of Admiralty and by the Army and AirCouncils. The Defence Council will also replace the Defence Board setup in 1958.22. The Defence Council will consist of: The Secretary of State for defence the Ministers of state the Chief of the Defence staff the Chief of the Naval staff the Chief of the General staff the Chief of the Air staff the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Secretary of State for defence the Permanent Under Secretary of State.The Minister of Aviation and the Minister of Public Building and works will attend to discuss all appropriate business.23. The Defence Council will deal mainly with major defence policy.Management will be delegated to Navy, Army, and Air Force Boards ofthe Defence Council, of each of which the Secretary of State will be Chair-man.  Judicial and quasi judicial powers for the review of disciplinary
awards, the redress of grievances, and the like will be vested in theseBoards. But all regulations, orders, and instructions hitherto issued bythe Board of Admiralty and by the Army and Air Councils will be issued under the authority of the Defence Council. The titles of the variousregulations, orders, and instructions will be reviewed and altered as necessary.24. The Secretary of State for Defence will normally ask the appro-priate Minister of State to act for him as Chairman of each Board. Theother members will be the appropriate Parliamentary Under Secretary ofState, Chief of Staff, and senior military officers and civilian officials incharge of the military and civil staffs responsible for the management ofthe Service concerned, e.g. in each case: The Chief of staff the Vice and Deputy Chiefs of staff the Principal Personnel OfficerThe Principal Administrative OfficerThe Second Permanent Under Secretary of state in the case of the Royal Navy the Controller and the director general Ships and of the Army the Master General of theOrdnanceThe Chief Scientist.25. The Chiefs of Staff and other senior military officers of the ministry will be known as :  Royal NavyChief of the naval staff and First sea lord.Vice and DeputyChiefs of theNaval Staff.Chief of naval personnel and second Sea Lord.Controller of the NavyChief of Naval supplies and Transport and vice Controller.ArmyChief of the GeneralStaff.Vice and DeputyChiefs of theGeneral Staff.Adjutant GeneralQuartermasterGeneral.Master General of the ordnance.Royal Air ForceChief of the Air Staff.Vice and DeputyChiefs of theAir Staff.Air Member forPersonnel.Air Member for supply and organisation.Second Permanent Under Secretaries of State for each Service, subordinateto the Permanent Under Secretary of State for Defence, will replace thepresent Secretary of the Admiralty and the Permanent Under secretaries of State of the War Office and Air Ministry. They will be known as theSecond Permanent Under Secretaries of State (Royal Navy), (Army), and(Royal Air Force).
00VII. General Departmental Organisation26. The three priacipal advisers to the Secretary of State will be theChief of the Defence Staff, the Chief Scientific Adviser, and the permanent under Secretary of State. The Permanent Under Secretary of State will beresponsible for co-ordinating their views and establishing the means for doing so.27. Within the Ministry the organisation will comprise:  The Defence Staff, including the Naval, General, and Air Staffs, underthe Chief of the Defence Staff and the Chiefs of Staff Committee.The Defence Scientific Staff under the Chief Scientific Adviser.The Defence Secretariat under the Permanent Under Secretary ofState, assisted by a fourth Second Permanent Under Secretary ofState (Defence Secretariat). The latter will have general respon-sibilities, as distinct from responsibility for managing a particular service.The Staffs of the Principal Personnel Officers of the Royal Navy, Army,and Royal Air Force.The Staffs of the Principal Administrative Officers of the Royal Navy,Army, and Royal Air Force.The Staff cf the Controller of the Navy.The Staff of the Master General of the Ordnance.The Staffs of the Second Permanent Under Secretaries of State (royal navy), (Army), and (Royal Air Force).The main responsibilities of these officers and officials and their staffs andthe manner in which their work will be organised is set out below. Theirrelationship within the organisation is shown in the chart attached. Thechart also shows the line of authority and responsibility which runs fromthe Secretary of State through the whole organisation.VIII. Chiefs of Staff Organisation28. The Chiefs of Staff Committee will remain in its present form.29. The Chief of the Defence Staff, the Chief of the Naval Staff, theChief of the General Staff, and the Chief of the Air Staff form the Chiefsof Staff Committee. The Chief of the Defence Staff is chairman of thisCommittee. The Chiefs of Staff Committee are collectively responsible tothe Government for professional advice on strategy and military operations and on the military implications of defence policy. The collective advice of the Chiefs of Staff Committee will be tendered to the Secretary of state by the Chief of the Defence Staff. The Chiefs of the Naval, General, andAir Staffs will continue to be the professional Heads of their own Services.30. When there is divergence of view between the Chiefs of Staff, theChief of the Defence Staff will submit the alternatives, when they have beendiscussed and defined, to the Secretary of State for decision or for considera-tion as necessary by the Defence and Oversea Committee and the Cabinet.The Chief of the Defence Staff, as the principal military adviser to theSecretary of State, will tender his own advice to the Minister in the lightof the views expressed.(30771)a3
31. The Chiefs of Staff are responsible through the Chief of the DefenceStaff to the Secretary of State for the conduct of military operations. Opera-ticnal orders will continue to be sent out in ifihe name of the Chief of theDefence Staff. Consequential or single Service orders will be issued underthe authority of the individual Chiefs of Staff.IX. The Defence Staff32. The Naval, General, and Air Staffs, with the joint Service staffs of thepresent Ministry of Defence, will together constitute the Defence Staff. Theywill be responsible to the Chiefs of Staff Committee and through its Chairmanto the Secretary of State. The Defence Staff must take into account theviews of the individual Services amd ensure that plans are based on a realisticassessment of their capabilities. But their principal corporate duty will beto find the best Defence solution to the problems with which they are faced.33. It will be easier for these staffs to work together when they are in thesame building. But this would not be enough for effective control of plan-ning and operations. Four new organisations will therefore take their placealongside such existing staffs as the Joint Planning and Joint Warfare staffs.34. The new organisations will be:  (a) A Defence Operations Executive.(b) A Defence Operational Requirements Staff.(c) A Defence Signals Staff.id) A Defence Intelligence Staff.The Defence Operations Executive35. There will be a new Defence Operations Centre which will be thecentral core of a system of Operations Rooms for the co-ordination andcontrol of the activities cf the individual Services. The system as a whole will be permanently manned and organised to provide the facilities and information necessary for certain speedy reaction to a sudden emergency.36. Central control will be exercised through a Defence OperationsExecutive. It will consist of the Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff, the assistant Chief of Naval Staff, the Director of Military Operations, andthe Assistant Chief of the Air Staff (Operations).The Defence Operational Requirements Staff37. Better arrangements are needed for formulating requirements forweapons and equipment on a Defence, as opposed to a single Service, basis,and for providing militairy advice about the Defence research and develop-mant programme. A small central Defence staff will be set up for these purposes under an Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff, operational requirements.38. This staff will review long term requirements, sponsor long termstudies on future concepts cf war, and examine and harmonise all major new weapon requirements, including those for new ships, to preventduplication of effort.39. The staff will identify at an early stage those problems of weapon andequipment development which require central decisions, with the object of
ensuring that the research and development programme is more closely related to military requirements and the scienffiic, technical, and financial resources available.The Defence Signals Staff40. A Defence Signals Staff will be established under an Assistant Chief ofthe Defence Staff (Signals). Staffs dealing with subjects common to all three services will be integrated. An integrated Defence Communications Centrewill be the focus of a signals system connecting all buildings forming partof the new Miniisitry of Defence to the military and civil networks at homeand overseas. The Centre will be a major step towards the integration ofmilitary communications worldwide. Existing single Service Centres willbe abolished.The Defence Intelligence Staff41. Service Intelligence Staffs and the Joint Intelligence Bureau, which covers scientific, technical, and economic intelligence, will be pooled toform a Defence Intelligence Staff. Senior officers of each Service will stillbe responsible for presenting their professional views on subjects whichprimarily concern their own Service. But the staff as a whole will beintegrated. It will be responsible for producing a Defence Intelligenceviewpoint on all important matters.X. The Chief Scientific Adviser and the Defence Scientific Staff42. The work of the Chief Scientific Adviser covers all aspects of defence which are affected by scientific advance, in particular defence research and weapons development. This work is of critical importance because modernweapons systems are becoming increasingly complex, sophisticated, and costly, and are liable to premature obsolescence because of the pace of scientific and technical development.43. In order to enable the Chief Scientific Adviser to play his full partin the formulation and control of the defence research and development programme, a number of changes are needed. The improved arrangementsfor the formulation of military requirements through the establishment ofthe Defence Operational Requirements Staff have already been described.In addition scientific effort throughout the Ministry of Defence must be more closely co-ordinated than at present. Arrangements for the oversight ofdefence research and for the control of weapons development must be improved. Operational research must be more closely co-ordinated. Forthis purpose the Chief Scientific Adviser&apos;s staff must be strengthened withsuitably qualified scientists and engineers. These measures are described in detail below.44. Wherever the problems are of a Defence as opposed to a singleService character the scientific staffs of the present Ministry of Defence andthe present Service Departments will work together under the Chief scientific adviser as the Defence Scientific Staff.45. In order to improve the control of Defence research and weaponsdevelopment, the present Defence Research Policy Committee will be re-placed by two new Committees, both chaired by the Chief Scientific Adviser.
These Committees will work closely with the Defence Operational Require-ments Staff and the Defence Secretariat.46. First, there will be a Defence Research Committee to oversee all military research which does not directly support approved weapon andequipment projects. The Committee will advise the Secretary of State andChiefs of Staff on all scientific and technical matters which may affectDefence research policy. The Committee will keep the Defence research programme under review so as to ensure that it is appropriate to Defenceneeds, and is matched by .the resources available. The Committee will inparticular bring to notice in good time scientific developments which maybe of military interest.47. The membership of this Committee will be mainly scientific, andwill include independent scientists. The problems of defence research areseldom amenable to straightforward analysis and accounting. Judgmentwill play a major part, and for this reason it is essential to call upon thebest advice available from whatever source.48. Secondly, since the problems of weapons development are somewhat different, a Weapons Development Committee will be set1 up. This Com-mittee will advise the Secretary of State and Chiefs of Staff on what major projects should be included in the development programme. It will keepthe programme under review so as to ensure that it is properly matchedto the available resources, current defence policy, and operational require-ments agreed in the light of what is technically feasible. The Committeewill be responsible for the prompt detection of any difficulties which may arise in the execution of the programme.49. It will be closely linked to the Defence Research Committee by asubstantial degree of common membership, but since the problems withwhich it deals will have in varying degree a military, scientific, technical,financial, and economic content, it will draw to a larger extent on militaryand administrative staffs.50. The Ministry of Aviation will be represented on both the defence research Committee and the Weapons Development Committee.51. Co-ordination of the defence research and development programme with other elements of the Defence Programme and Budget and the issueof the executive instructions needed to give effect to the approved pro-gramme will be the responsibility of the Defence Secretariat.52. A third Committee chaired by a member of the Chief scientific adviser&apos;s staff and consisting of the Directors of Operational Research of thethree Services will co-ordinate operational research activities.The purpose of increasing the staff under the Chief Scientific Ad-viser is primarily to provide adequate service for these committees, to under-take and develop techniques for the study and evaluation of weaponssystems, to undertake cost effectiveness studies where appropriate, and to investigate longer term&apos; problems of a scientific nature which have a bearing on defence policy. The increase is also needed in order to develop close association at all levels between the Defence Scientific Staff and the DefenceStaff and Defence Secretariat. Under the direction of the Chief scientific adviser, the normal method of working will be to form ad hoc Panels, or
Working Groups to deal with specific problems, drawing upon appropriatespecialists from the military, scientific, and civil administrative staffs of theMinistry of Defence, the Ministry of Aviation, the Services and outsideadvisers.XI. The Permanent Under Secretary of State and theDefence Secretariat54. The Permanent Under Secretary of State will be responsible for co-ordinating the business of the Ministry and for establishing such machineryas may be necessary for this purpose. He will be assisted by the four SecondPermanent Under Secretaries of State who will respectively be responsible forthe Defence Secretariat and for the civil administrative staffs concerned, inconjunction with the Service management staffs, with the management of theRoyal Navy, the Army, and the Royal Air Force.55. The Defence Secretariat will be established by bringing togethercertain civil administrative staffs from the present Ministry of defence and the present Service Departments. The staffs in question are those concerned with major defence policy, and at present responsible for generaladvice and assistance to the Chiefs of Staff. They will be responsible for advising the Permanent Under Secretary of State and through him theSecretary of State on the defence programme and budget and other mattersof major policy, including oversea matters in consultation with the Foreign,Commonwealth Relations, and Colonial Offices. They will also be thechannel through which the oversea policy Departments seek military advice.They will continue to be responsible for general advice and assistance tothe Chiefs of Staff.56. The Second Permanent Under Secretary of State (Defence Secre-tariat) will also be responsible for identifying fields (for example stores,technical establishments, or training) in which administration might with advantage be placed on a Defence rather than a single Service basis. Hewill recommend changes in Departmental organisation to achieve this.XII. Defence Programme and Budget57. A central problem of the new Ministry will be the drawing up ofthe defence programme and budget and the supervision of its execution,the long term financial planning and control of the defence programme andthe allocation of resources to the three Services will be a primary respon-sibility of the Permanent Under Secretary of State.58. Such planning must take into account political, military, scientific,technical, financial, and economic factors. To achieve success the frontline, man-power, and other associated plans for the three Services mustbe drawn up on a Defence basis. There must be constant collaboration between military, scientific, and civil administrative staffs, a sound generalappreciation of each other&apos;s problems, and a common effort to improveplanning and control techniques. Finally all the relevant facts must be fully and accurately presented.59. The Permanent Under Secretary of State will be responsible forco-ordinating the views of military, scientific, and civil administrative staffs.In this he will be assisted by the Second Permanent Under Secretary ofState (Defence Secretariat) and by the appointment of a Deputy Under
Secretary of State (Programmes and Budget). The latter will control apart of the Defence Secretariat which will be responsible for the full scope and content of the defence programme and the Defence Budget.60. The Deputy Under Secretary of State (Programmes and Budget)and his staff will bring together defence policy, requirements to meet that policy, and available resources and will turn these into approved and controlled physical programmes and Votes. They will deal with pro-grammes, resources, and finance, particularly in the preparation and analysis of long term costings, the allocation of resources, the preparation of the assumptions governing the annual Estimates, and the monitoring of projectswithin the defence programme.XIII. Defence Estimates61. As in the past, the Secretary of State for Defence will present toParliament an annual White Paper giving information about the defence budget as a whole. The annual White Paper, in addition to the estimates for the present Ministry of Defence and the three Service Departments,includes expenditure incurred by the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministryof Public Building and Works.62. The Secretary of State for Defence will also present to parliamentary single set of Defence Estimates. This will include Votes for the three services and a Central Vote; it will also include, in a form yet to bedetermined, detailed information about the defence expenditure of theMinistry of Aviation and the Ministry of Public Building and Works. the aim will be to simplify and clarify the presentation of defence expenditure to Parliament, as a contribution both to the more effective control ofexpenditure and to the improvement of information for Parliament and thepublic.63. The estimates for the three Services will continue to be debatedseparately each year.XIV. Accounting64. All the Defence Votes will be accounted for to Parliament by thenew Ministry of Defence. The four Second Permanent Under secretaries of State will be designated as Accounting Officers accordingly in respectof the Votes of the three Services and the Vote for the central element ofthe Ministry.65. The organisation will provide for strong central financial controlwhere it is required, in the allocation of resources and in the planning of the Defence Programme which is the responsibility of the permanent under Secretary of State. It will also provide for delegation and de-centralisation to the Second Permanent Under Secretaries of State where,again, efficiency and economy require it, that is to say in day to dayfinancial management.XV. Management66. The management of the Services and the procurement of weapons and military equipment, other than those for which the Ministry of aviation is responsible, will continue to be in the hands of the PrincipalPersonnel and Administrative Officers, the Controller of the Navy, the
Master General of the Ordnance; and the Second Permanent Under Secre-taries of State (Royal Navy), (Army), and (Royal Air Force). Theefficiency, contentment, and morale of the Services will depend largely ontheir efforts.67. Efficiency, leadership, and morale require a focus for the manage-ment of each Service and for safeguarding the career interests and the welfare of all ranks and of civilian staff. Under the Secretary of State and defence Council this requirement will be met by the Navy, Army, and AirForce Boards, of which the Chiefs of the Naval; General, artd Air Staffs,as the professional heads of each Service, will be designated the SeniorService Members.68. To enable management problems to be dealt with on a Defencebasis wherever practicable, staffs who operate in identical management fieldsfor each of the Services will so far as possible be accommodated in thesame building or in groups of buildings which are reasonably close to eachother. With the same object the organisation of the Principal personnel and Administrative Officers Committees will be strengthened by the appoint-ment of a Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Personnel arid Logistics) ofthree star tank, to deal with the Defence&quot; aspects of personnel and logisticproblems. Together with the Second Permanent Under Secretary of State(Defence Secretariat) he will be responsible for the closer co-ordirtationof management policies and procedures, both in the further developmentof the internal organisation of the new Ministry and in the administrationof the Services;69. Arrangements will be made to refer to the Secretary of State for decision proposals for the promotion and appointment of senior officers,honours, and awards.70. The presence on the Boards Of the Chiefs and Vice arid DeputyChiefs of the Naval, General, and Air Staffs emphasises that the Naval,General, artd Air Staffs, in addition to their role in &quot;the Defence Staff, Willcontinue to play a large part in management.71. Much of the work of the naval, General, and Air Staffs in anycase falls outside the fields of major policy and point operations, being directed to the organisation and control of their own Services; Close CBL-laboratiori between them and the other staffs responsible for the manage-nient of each Service is essential for this reason;72. It is equally important that civil administrative staff in the DefenceSecretariat who are particularly concerned with an individual Service,together with the scientific staffs of the Services, should continue to make a major contribution to management. They will act with the appropriateService management staffs for this purpose.XVI. Relationships between the Sovereign and Services73. There will be rib change iii the&quot; relationships arid traditional links between the Sovereign arid the three Services arid units bf the Services fbl-ldwirig the reorganisation described. Her Majesty has; in addition; graciouslyconsented to assume the title of Lord High Admiral. She Will fly the flagof the Lord High Admiral at sea arid at naval establishments ashore on official occasions, with the Royal Standard.  This will perpetuate the name
qof an office which goes back 600 years in history, and which would other-wise be lost following the abolition of the Lord Commissioners who atpresent exercise the office.74. A senior officer will be appointed as Defence Services Secretary toact as the link between the Sovereign and the Secretary of State for defence on matters which concern the Sovereign^ relationships with the three Ser-vices, and as the sole channel of communication for those matters whichare at present dealt with by the Naval, Military, and Air Secretaries. Thelatter also play a major part in the personnel administration of the Servicesand will continue to do so.XVII. Ministry of Aviation75. The Ministry of Aviation has wide responsibilities for civil aswell as for military research and development. These are indivisible.Civil research and development may well increase in the future. The Ministryas also responsible for sponsorship of the aircraft industry.76. These responsibilities would, if transferred to the new Ministry ofDefence, place on it, and particularly on the Secretary of State, a very heavy additional load, much of it outside the defence sphere.77. For these main reasons it has been decided that the Ministry of aviation will continue to be an independent Department, responsible forthe execution of programmes of defence research, development, and produc-tion formulated and approved by the Secretary of State for Defence.78. Close links must however be maintained between the Ministry of aviation and the new Ministry of Defence. As already stated the Ministerof Aviation will attend the Defence Council whenever matters affectinghis Department are under consideration. The Ministry of Aviation willbe fully associated with the new arrangements for the formulation of opera-tional requirements, for the control of defence research and development,and for weapons system evaluation. The Ministry of Defence will in future be represented on the main Ministry of Aviation departmental committeesresponsible for the management of defence research, development, and pro-duction programmes.79. There will be the freest possible communication at all levels betweenthe Ministry of Defence and the headquarters and establishments of theMinistry of Aviation. The Secretary of State for Defence and his senior officials will be free to call in for consultation officials of the Ministryof Aviation and its establishments, keeping the Minister of Aviation informed.Ministry of Aviation scientists will be freely available to serve on Ministryof Defence panels. The Ministry of Aviation will inform the Ministry ofDefence of developments in industry and will facilitate any necessary contacts.80. In view of the importance of close consultation between the Ministryof Defence and the Ministry of Aviation the Minister of Aviation and thosesenior officials who are mainly or exclusively concerned with defence projectswill be accommodated in the same building as the staffs of the Ministryof Defence who are responsible for policy. So far as space permits, otherMinistry of Aviation staffs will be accommodated closer to the Ministryof Defence than at present.
81. Arrangements will be made for the regular and easy interchange of staff between the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Aviation, par-ticularly in the scientific field. Existing arrangements for this purpose willbe reinforced.82. It is hoped that these measures to strengthen the links between the ministries of Aviation and Defence and the new and improved procedures for the control of the research and development programme will result incloser monitoring of the progress of individual major projects. It is alsohoped that technical and cost factors which seem likely to cause unforeseendifficulties will be identified with greater speed and certainty, and that thiswill enable decisions to overcome such difficulties to be promptly taken.XVIII. Accommodation83. The Defence Staff, Defence Secretariat, and Defence Scientific Staff,together with elements of the Management Staffs most closely associatedwith them, will be accommodated in the building in Whitehall Gardens atpresent occupied by the Air Ministry and the Board of Trade. The Boardof Trade will move to new offices.84. The remainder of the existing Service Departments will be re-distributed in other buildings at present available to them, taking intoaccount the needs of the Ministry of Aviation.XIX. Civilian Staffs85. A Departmental re-organisation on this scale is unprecedented intime of peace. It will require a positive effort of constructive thought andimagination, and a broadening of loyalties on the part of all members ofthe new Department. The Government are confident that this approach totheir responsibilities will be forthcoming from the civil servants of all classes and grades who have in the past worked wholly for one or other of theService Departments.86. Of the permanent staff of the Department all members of the Ad-ministrative class will in future be regarded as forming a common pool andwill be posted freely to any Division of the Ministry. There must also be free interchange for senior staff of other Civil Service classes in the Depart-ment of Defence and the Ministry of Aviation, in particular defencescientists.87. Common services and procedures will be introduced wherever practicable.XX. Security88. An officer of appropriate seniority and experience will be estab-lished to co-ordinate the work of security staffs throughout the Ministry, topromote the standardisation of security policy and practices and provide asingle source of advice on security matters for the Secretary of State.XXI. Public Relations89. A Defence Public Relations Staff will be established. The presentMinistry of Defence and Service Departments&apos; information offices will be amalgamated, but in addition to the Director of Public Relations there will
still be Chief Information Officers specialising in the affairs of each of theServices.XXII. The Meteorological Office90. Although not part of the defence organisation the meteorological office has for many years been attached to the Air Ministry. In futureresponsibility for the Meteorological Office will rest with the Secretary ofState for Defence. These arrangements are without prejudice to the out-come of the current review of the organisation for the promotion of civilscience by Government agencies.XXIII. Numbers91. The object of the reorganisation is to improve the performance ofcertain tasks and to undertake others which cannot be carried out satis-factofily under the present system of separate Departments.92. Econdniies will be sought to offset the hew posts (responsible forthese tasks. In part these economies will be the product of reorganisation.Sut in the main they will be realised as a result of further progressive changein the detailed organisation and procedures of the new Ministry when ithas settled in its new accommodation. They will therefore be gradual.XXIV. Timetable93. The necessary legislation will be introduced during the comingAutumn.94. Subject to its passage the new Ministry of Defence will be estab-lished and the Secretary of State, Ministers of State, Defence Council aridNavy; Army, and Air Force Boards Of the Defence Council, and the senior officers and officials of the Ministry Will be appointed with effect from 1stApril, 1964.95. Soriie other features of the new organisation, for example the appoint -ment of the Deputy Secretary (Programmes and Budget) and the hew arrarige-ments for the control of the Defence Research and Development programme,will be introduced before 1st April next. Others can only be introducedafter the new Ministry moves to Whitehall Gardens.96. This will be as early in 1964 as the accommodation there can be2nd July, 1963.Printed in England and published by her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office(30771)  Wt. 373-88   151   7/63   St.S.
