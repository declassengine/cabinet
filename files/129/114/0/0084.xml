% confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1963C. (63) 184 Copy No.    6416th October, 1963CABINETINDONESIAMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer was asked (C.C. (63) 53rd Conclusions, Minute 1) to consider whether thelatest developments in Indonesia required us to reconsider the extent of the exportcredit facilities which we provided for the promotion of trade with Indonesia. I attach a Memorandum by the Treasury. I agree with its conclusions and invitemy colleagues to endorse them.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,15th October, 1963.3300
INDONESIAMemorandum by the treasury 0 The Export Credits Guarantee Department (E.C.G.D.) cover is at presentgiven only under Section 2 of the Export Guarantees Act, whereby such guaranteesmay be given (with Treasury consent) as appear expedient in the national interest for encouraging trade. At present there are no restrictions on guarantees for short-term business, i.e., 180 days&apos; credit. For longer-term business there is an absolute limit of  31- million per annum on liabilities but, within this, Departments;onsider each case before any offer to guarantee is made: and exporters have totake 25 per cent of the risk for their own account.2.   E.C.G.D.&apos;s present liabilities are as follows:(a) Short-term business: some  250,000 ( 90,000 of goods shipped butawaiting payment, and  160,000 unshipped). But payment for this classof business with Indonesia is mostly on shipment or on arrival, and what is being insured is cash payment rather than short-term creditproper.(b) Longer-term business: firm liabilities amount to  14 million (on businessvalued at  20 million) which includes a financial guarantee, alreadyissued, for about  3 million for a tin dredger.3. The economic and political risks have grown more acute since the aboveattitude was agreed on between Departments, though the latest view is that further dramatic developments seem unlikely. We have no indication at presentthat the Indonesians intend to block payment to the United Kingdom, and in thesecircumstances Departments consider that it would be premature to refuse creditinsurance facilities for the limited amount of new business being done in this market. (The amount of short-term business coming forward for cover at themoment is likely to be small; shipments have recently averaged under  50,000 amonth.) They consider that to withdraw insurance facilities now might provokeadverse Indonesian reactions affecting a large amount of longer-term payments still outstanding; it would also disrupt commercial relations, which would be unnecessary and undesirable as long as there is still hope that the situation mayhe stabilised.4. There is no question of withdrawing cover on existing contracts whichE.C.G.D. has unconditionally agreed to insure.5.   Departments therefore consider that for the time being:(i) Short-term cover should still be available. A close watch will be kept to see that financial transfers from Indonesia continue.(ii) There should be no general withdrawal of longer-term cover, but even more severe standards should be applied in the presentinterdepartmental scrutiny of cases.6. Officials will review the situation again should there be any further adversedevelopments, and in any case will be examining it again in the course of the nextfew weeks.7. Officials of the Foreign Office, Board of Trade, Export Credits guarantee department and the Bank of England agree with these conclusions.
