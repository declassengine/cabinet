Printed for the Cabinet. July 1963C. (63) 127 Copy No. 6 216th July, 1963CABINETFUTURE POLICY FOR HORTICULTUREMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food at the meeting of the Prime Minister^ Committee on Agricultural Policy onthe 15th May, I was authorised, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, to ascertain informally the views of the industry on my proposals fora new policy for horticulture and then invited to submit these proposals to theCabinet (GEN. 794/3rd Meeting Minutes, Item 2). &apos; -2. For many years our horticultural policy has been based almost entirely ontariff protection. In 1959 we pledged ourselves to continue to support horticulturewith tariffs .as the main instrument and to give the horticultural industry a measureof support equivalent to that given to agriculture generally. We saw, during the brussels negotiations, how difficult it was going to be to reconcile that pledge withour entry into Europe. But quite apart from that, I believe we have got to take afresh look at horticulture if our policy is to fit in to the concept of modernisingBritain. I believe we ought to work towards a situation in which our industry neednot depend on tariff protection against goods with which our growers ought fairlyto be able to compete. What I would like to see, therefore, is freedom to negotiate on the horticultural tariff in forthcoming trade negotiations, starting with the kennedy Round, coupled with new measures of direct assistance to help theindustry become more competitive. But it is clear that we could secure the agreementof the industry to binding or reduction of import duties only if they were satisfiedthat the new measures of assistance we proposed offered a fair alternative.3. The policy proposals that have been discussed informally with the national farmers&apos; Union have therefore had two broad aspects: first, the positive steps thatmight be taken to improve the competitive ability of the industry; secondly, theextent to which the horticultural tariff might then be regarded as expendable inthe national interest.4. The direct measures of assistance which might be offered by theGovernment would be threefold. First, the Horticulture Improvement scheme would be extended for a period of 10 years and would be expanded to provide grants for a wide range of production equipment, for the reorganisation of small businesses,and for the establishment of marketing co-operatives. Secondly, arrangements would be made to make credit more readily available to growers, although the rateof interest would not be directly subsidised. Thirdly, the Government would agree in principle to grant-aid the rebuilding or improvement of a number of wholesalehorticultural markets. To all these measures the unions may be expected to giveunqualified support. And I am now satisfied that in addition they would be preparedto submit to the discipline of compulsory grading of horticultural produce passing through wholesale channels of trade, beginning with a few products most amenable to this treatment.5. The cost to the Exchequer of the expanded Horticulture ImprovementScheme might be in the region of  25 million (including the  8 million authorised for the existing Scheme), and the grant-aid to market redevelopment might amountto about  20 million. The annual cost of the credit guarantee should be less than 100,000, and of administration of compulsory grading about  400,000.1 understandthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer would accept these proposals if they gave us the room for manoeuvre on the tariff that we want.2823
6. We have put to the unions that, since the combined effect of these measures should be to bring the industry to a higher state of competitive efficiency, their introduction should enable the Government to regard the horticultural tariff as no longer inviolable. In defining the Government^ subsequent roam for manoeuvre,however, we should have to consider the horticultural tariff in two parts. The first would comprise those items which are less vulnerable (or &quot; non-sensitive &quot;) tocompetition from imports and enjoy a tariff of no more than 10 per cent ad valorem.The second would comprise the vulnerable (or &quot; sensitive &quot;) products which enjoyspecific duties or high ad valorem duties during the home season.7. So far as the non-sensitive products were concerned, we should wish to be free to offer reductions in the tariff in the immediate future if this were in thenational interest; and I am satisfied that to this the unions would be ready to agree.8. As for the sensitive products, we should have to allow time for growers totake advantage of the help we were offering. So we should wish to be free in thefirst instance only to bind the duties at their current levels, but later-after a standstill period of some years to reduce them if the national interest so required.I am now fairly sure that the unions could be persuaded to accept something on theselines though there are certain reservations in their attitude so far.9. This attitude is much conditioned by their fear of surpluses from othercountries being offered here at unrealistically low prices and undermining our market. Specific duties not only offer protection against normal competition butalso a safeguard against such abnormal competition. And if they were to be reduced the unions would wish to be sure that the Government would, if necessary, provide some alternative safeguard against unequal competition of this kind. We cannotdecide now what form any such safeguard should take, if only because our firstaim should be to discuss what is essentially a European problem with the european economic Community and other countries. But if we give an assurance that we accept the need for a safeguard in one form or another, I think we might succeed inwinning the industry&apos;s support for a package deal, including freedom for theGovernment to bind duties on all sensitive products now and, after a standstill of only three or four years, to reduce these duties if the national interest so required(subject only to the usual right of the industry to have their views taken intoaccount).10. To show how such a package deal might be publicly presented, I appenda draft statement incorporating the best terms on the tariff aspect to which it mightbe possible to bring the unions to agree. This will take a few weeks. The industry&apos;representatives (especially certain sections) are not yet convinced and are not yetpersuaded that they can carry their members. But, assuming that, after a period ofreflection for which they have asked, we could be assured of their support for theintroduction of a policy on these lines, I feel sure it would be right for us to take this step. Legislation would be needed for the four positive features of this policy, but itwould be mainly of an enabling kind. Much detailed work will also be required and,in consultation with the Treasury, I should wish to proceed with this as far aspossible in the next two or three months.11. I therefore invite my colleagues to agree to my continuing discussions withthe industry with a view to securing their agreement to the proposed new policy outlined in this statement. My aim would be to make a statement when the Housereassembles, and to introduce the necessary legislation by the end of the year.C. S.Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S.W. 1,15th July, 1963.
annex draft STATEMENT ON HORTICULTUREFor many years the principal means of support for the horticultural industry has been the tariff. More recently there has been a growing body of responsibleopinion that all practical steps should be taken to bring our horticultural productionand marketing to a higher state of competitive efficiency. The Government sharethis view and have concluded that they should offer substantial assistance to theindustry for this purpose, thereby creating conditions in which reconsideration ofthe tariff would be possible.The Government have therefore decided to introduce a number of measuresto help the horticultural industry to reduce costs of production, to improvemarketing, and thereby to enhance its competitive position. These will includegrants towards the cost of a wide range of production equipment (includingreplacement glasshouses) for existing viable holdings, towards the reorganisation of such holdings, and towards the establishment of marketing co-operatives.Arrangements will also be made to provide guaranteed credit facilities forhorticultural producers.In addition to the grant-aid already available to growers and co-operativestowards equipment for the better marketing of horticultural produce, theGovernment will offer grants towards the cost of redevelopment of a number of wholesale horticultural markets throughout the country. They will also seekpowers to require the grading to prescribed standards of horticultural producepassing through wholesale channels of trade.Details of all these measures will be worked out in consultation with theinterests concerned in order that legislation may be introduced as soon as possible.Introduction of these substantial forms of assistance should enable theGovernment to make changes in the tariff on horticultural items, if this is in thenational interest. The timing of any such changes would, however, be of greatimportance.Many products are not vulnerable to competition from imports since theirperishability, or their bulk in relation to their value, afford a high degree of natural protection. For these, early reductions in import duties could be made without damage to the industry.Other products, however, are at present more sensitive to overseas competition and enjoy a high level of tariff protection during the home season. For these, theGovernment will feel free to bind the duties at their current levels if they consider this to be in the national interest. There would, however, have to be a period ofthree or four years before any reductions in the tariff on these sensitive items couldbe considered. This would give the industry time to benefit from the assistanceoffered, which should enable it to withstand any normal competition from imports.After this standstill period, the Government will then be free to make reductions in the duties on sensitive items if they consider this to be in the national interest.In considering any such reductions, the Government would of course takethe views of the industry fully into account. In this connection the government recognise in particular that the specific duties on a number of horticultural productshave not only offered protection against normal competition from imports, but have also been a safeguard against abnormal competition from unrealisticallylow-priced imports arising from surpluses in other countries. It is likely that suchsurpluses will reappear from time to time and that methods to prevent them fromundermining our market will continue to be required. The Government intend to discuss this problem with other countries with a view to devising satisfactorysafeguards.
