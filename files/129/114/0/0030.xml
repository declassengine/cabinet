CABINETDISPOSAL OF CHALGROVE AIRFIELDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department as requested by the Cabinet at their meeting on 11th July (C.C. (63) 45thConclusions, Minute 7) the Home Affairs Committee have given furtherconsideration to the disposal of Chalgrove airfield in the light of the LordChancellor^ suggestion that the dilemma in which the Government are placedin deciding whether to proceed with the sale of the airfield to the Martin-BakerAircraft Company or to attempt to negotiate a lease might be avoided by makingthe sale conditional upon the Company entering into a covenant not to use theland for industry, or otherwise than for the testing of ejector equipment, and tooffer it to the former owners when the Company ceased to use it for this purpose.2. Such a covenant would be binding on the Company and irrevocable bythem. As regards the use of the land, it could be enforced against the Company,if necessary by injunction. As regards the offer of the land to the former owners,the Air Ministry would have a right of action for damages in the event of a breach of the covenant; but the value of this would be limited, since it would be virtually impossible to show that the Air Ministry had suffered any damage. Thecovenant would not be binding on any company which might buy up the Martin-Baker Aircraft Company.3. In spite of the limitations of this device, the covenant, which could be made public, would show that the Government had done all that they reasonably could to protect the interests of the former owners, and that the Company had enteredinto obligations which were legally binding upon it. This should go some way toremove the anxieties of the local residents, who appear /to be more concerned aboutthe use of the land (in respect of which the covenant is enforceable) than aboutthe eventual recovery of their land by the former owners.4. The majority of members of the Home Affairs Committee now considerthat, if the Company are willing to enter into the proposed covenant, the saleshould proceed. They take the view that the Government are committed to thesale; that there are strong national interests involved both in the manufacture ofejector seats for the Services and in the Company&apos;s considerable export business which it would be wrong to jeopardise; and that, if the Government went back ontheir promise to sell, the criticism from the Company and from those who would support it would be more formidable and damaging than that of the local residents.5. A minority of the Committee still consider that a lease would be the bettersolution; but they recognise that, in view of Mr. Martin&apos;s repeated refusal to entertain a lease, this may not be attainable, and in that event they would be content to accept a sale, subject to the Company&apos;s acceptance of the covenant.6, In these circumstances I ask the Cabinet to agree that the sale should proceed, provided that the Company is willing to enter into a covenant not to use the land for industry or otherwise than for the testing of ejector equipment andto offer it to the former owners when the Company ceased to use it for this purpose.H.
