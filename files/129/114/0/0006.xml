AnnexMEETING OF AMBASSADORS AND HIGH COMMISSIONERS FROMTROPICAL AFRICA, 21st-24th MAY, 1963General conclusions. Pan-AfricanismWhether Commonwealth or foreign, the new African States share certain basicproblems. Unlike other under-developed parts of the world they have no real history and no culture on to which twentieth century civilisation can easily be grafted. all of them are conscious, though they may not admit it publicly, of their dependence on the developed world. To most of them the withdrawal of non-African expertisewould represent the creation of a dangerous vacuum. These are among the reasons which create the urge towards Pan-Africanism. There is an emotional desire tocling together, whether or not practical results are achieved. But the high point ofthe Pan-African movement had perhaps been reached during the colonial era, andthere is now little prospect of any effective grouping uniting the countries north andsouth of the Sahara. Similarly any organisation for wider African unity whichemerges from the Addis Ababa meeting is likely to be loose and vague. PresentAfrican leaders are above all concerned to maintain their status and their votes atthe United Nations. Reactions to the problem of the Somali areas in Kenya illustratehow arbitrary boundaries inherited from colonial days tend after independence tobecome sacrosanct. But for all this, there is genuine emotion behind the movement for African unity.II. Commonwealth and Foreign Africa2. There are profound differences in outlook between the commonwealth and foreign countries in Tropical Africa. British Africa looks on the commonwealth as a world-wide association, not merely as a bilateral link with us alone. Theex-French territories, on the other hand, by virtue of their far closer ties with and greater dependence on France are more parochially minded. They are less inclined to become emotionally involved in Southern African problems; less ready to makethe running though they follow the majority in the anti-colonial field and moreinhibited about displeasing France. The Union of African and Malagasy States(U.A.M.) group wish to maintain their cohesion but v/ould not necessarily be opposed to closer co-operation with English-speaking Africans.III. The French Position3. French influence is directed towards keeping the U.A.M. together both to increase French weight in the world and to keep French Africa as a preserve for french business. French cultural imperialism is also a significant factor. general de Gaulle, moreover, is deeply interested in Africa and all important decisions are referred to him. The possibility for effective Anglo-French co-operation is. therefore,limited. Despite earlier fears that France might pursue neo-imperialism too hard and that the younger generation would quickly sweep aside the &quot; Black Parisians &quot;at the top, France&apos;s position in her ex-African territories is still far stronger thanmany would have prophesied two years ago. While we need be less tender of Frenchsusceptibilities since January, the maintenance of the French position is on thewhole a Western and indeed an African interest.IV. Communist Penetration4. At the moment the Russian bloc effort seems to have been held in checkand there has been an improvement in the situation as compared with say two yearsago. Nevertheless the Russians are still putting a lot of effort into Africa and wemay be in for trouble later. The Chinese are also a threat in East Africa. The crucialfactor is the resistance of the Africans themselves to foreign interference. Egyptianinfluence appears to be surprisingly slight.
V. Arms Policy5. There is some case for international co-ordination over the supply of arms to African countries between the United States, the French, the Germans and ourselves. It is unsatisfactory that many poverty stricken African countries arespending more on arms than they can afford. But any attempt to ration them mightonly make thern turn to other suppliers, of which there are plenty. We should lose the business and the goodwill. Moreover, we have to be careful not to seem to berefusing arms to black countries, while supplying them to South Africa (see below)and it would be hypocritical to impose limits on Tropical Africa. All we can do istry to use our influence to persuade African States not to arm unnecessarily. some countries in Africa want arms mainly to compete with Ghana which they regard asa threat. There may be room for some limited co-operation with the French heresince the French also want to limit arms supplies. We might start with an exchangeof information with the French about types of arms supplied. We can also explain to the French that we do not want an arms race. An approach to the French on theselines is in preparation. In ex-French Africa, there is a desire to maintain french troops which have a stabilising effect.VI.-Arms for Southern Africa6. It is our arms policy towards South Africa and Portugal which inspires the gravest doubts. We could not boycott Portugal herself as a NATO ally, and a collapse of Portuguese rule in Angola and Mozambique might well precipitateCongo-type situations. But we would be in trouble at the United Nations if armsdelivered to the Portuguese were turned to the suppression of disorder in theiroversea territories. This applies with even greater force in respect of South Africa.In African eyes most forms of military equipment delivered to South Africa are seen as intended for use against the Blacks in perpetuation of white rule. While we couldnot go along with any resolution on general economic sanctions against South africa in the Security Council, we should avoid being manoeuvred into the position of having to veto a resolution calling for a ban on arms supplies. It would be useless toattempt to justify such a veto to African opinion.VII-Southern Africa7. Southern Africa remains the main stumbling block to United kingdom interests throughout Tropical Africa, especially in the Commonwealth territories.8. We need to re-think our long-term interests. The Tropical African countries are likely to survive the next decade in some viable form. Can we expect the same ofSouth Africa or even Southern Rhodesia? The question is whether to offend the restof the world by pursuing policies towards South Africa conditioned by our economicand defence stakes there, or whether to take the calculated risk of offending SouthAfrica in order to improve our position elsewhere in Africa. The penalty we risk byretaining close links with the present regime in South Africa is that we might as a consequence forfeit our increasing economic stake in Tropical Africa, and whenwhite rule collapses, lose our stake in South Africa as well. Against this must be seen the 1962 figures for United Kingdom exports of  148 million to South Africa and 156 million to African Commonwealth countries.9. In the defence field the continuing importance of the Simonstownarrangements was questioned. But on behalf of the Chiefs of Staff it was explainedthat these arrangements were considered to be important because of our interest inthe security of the sea routes round the Cape and in possible air routes across and through Africa. The importance of being able to defend the sea route seemed,however, to rest on the perhaps unlikely assumption that we might become engagedin a major war of the old-fashioned kind, in which nuclear weapons were not usedor not used with decisive effect in the initial phase. The air route, which might berequired to deal with limited war in the Middle or Far East in the event of routesfurther north being ruled out for political reasons, was therefore of potentiallygreater importance than the Simonstown base. But our use of this route depended on ad hoc South African clearance for each flight.VIII.-Southern Rhodesia10. If independence were granted to Southern Rhodesia with no firm and priorcommitment about the extension of the franchise, there would be a move by african members to leave the Commonwealth (or even to exclude the United Kingdom from
it), and to break off diplomatic relations with us. Commonwealth countries are nowrealistic enough not to press for &quot; one man one vote &quot; overnight. But in their view,however little physical force we can exert on the spot, a strong card is still in our hands, namely, our ability to grant or withhold legitimacy to Southern Rhodesia&apos;independence. A real extension of the franchise visibly designed to put Africans ina majority in the foreseeable future is, therefore, an essential prerequisite to independence if the Commonwealth itself is to remain a reality in Africa.-. &apos;f*.
