THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1963C. (63) 103 Copy No. 7321 st June, 1963CABINETNATO NUCLEAR FORCE: MIXED-MANNED COMPONENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister of DefenceSince the Cabinet considered this subject on 30th May (C.C. (63) 36th Meeting,Minute 1) Admiral Ricketts. U.S.N., Vice-Chief of Naval Operations, has visitedLondon. The views of the United Kingdom Chiefs of Staff (with which the Ministerof Defence agrees) on the results of these talks are attached at Annex A and anote on the financial implications is at Annex B.2. The arguments for and against our participation are set out in memoranda by the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence (C. (63) 95 and 96 of 28th May).In summary, the arguments that have been stated against the establishment of a mixed-manned force and United Kingdom participation in it are:(a) No military requirement for the force has been established.(b) If there were a requirement to increase the military strength of the West,this would not be the right way to provide it.(c) Such a force would be the least credible of the various strategic nuclear weapons systems open to us for deterrence.(d) It is very expensive and is likely to require resources that would be put to better use in improving Western defences elsewhere.(e) The formation of such a force would almost certainly lead to increasedSoviet activity at sea, and therefore increase the chances of war bymiscalculation.(/) It would be a stepping stone to German national nuclear power.ig) It would be creating an alliance within the Alliance and is, therefore, likelyto prove divisive for NATO.(h) European doubts about the availability of nuclear support will not beallayed so long as there is a United States veto; but the surrender ofthat veto might excite serious Soviet reactions to German control of nuclear weapons.(/) There are in any case strong budgetary objections to any significant financial contribution by Her Majesty&apos;s Government. The 1965-66 DefenceCostings are up by  170 million in real terms on the Cabinet target of  1,850 million set last summer. The Costings make no allowance for the  15-20 million a year, which it is now estimated we might haveto contribute to this force if we join.3. The main arguments that have been stated for the establishment of theforce and for our participation in it can be summarised as:(a) The force would keep nuclear defence on an Atlantic basis and wouldfrustrate General de Gaulle&apos;s ambitions for a Europe founded on Frenchnuclear hegemony.(b) The force is likely to satisfy German nuclear ambitions for the next 10 or20 years.2692a
(c) Admiral Ricketts has shown that the force is technically feasible and thatsurface ships have certain advantages over submarines (e.g., they can behidden in coastal waters).(d) If the force is a success the United States would probably take accountof it in planning their future missile programme (i.e., it would not be auseless addition to the existing programme). It would be a substitute for MRBMs, which would be likely to be on German soil.(e) United Kingdom participation would maintain our influence with theUnited States and sustain the impetus of our policy towards Europe.4. The President on his forthcoming visit to the United Kingdom is certain topress hard for a definite British commitment. The immediate problem is therefore to decide what line the Prime Minister should take during the talks at Birch Grove.Line to take with President Kennedy5.  The Prime Minister might first make the following points:(a) We recognise that the problem exists of satisfying the demand of certainEuropean countries for a share in the ownership and control of nuclear weapons, but without increasing the number of national nuclear forces.(b) We recognise in particular that Germany will not indefinitely be satisfied with a position of obvious inferiority and that she is entitled to a voice in the control of the Western deterrent.(c) The concept of finding a solution to this problem by the creation of forces which, owing to the composition of their crews, or the organisation oftheir command, cannot be diverted to national use has attractions whenseen against the possible alternatives, such as the deployment on Germansoil of large numbers of long-range land-based missiles, subject onlyto United State custodial control, or the possibility of Germany having ashare in the French force de frappe.(d) We have given careful thought to the United States proposal for a fleet of 25 surface ships, each armed with eight Polaris A3 missiles. But itwould be superfluous to NATO&apos;s armoury which is already amplysupplied with nuclear weapons. Moreover it would require resources which would be much better employed in making good deficiencies.Alternative A6. The Prime Minister might then continue that Her Majesty&apos;s government cannot secure the necessary support in Parliament and in the country for UnitedKingdom participation unless they can make out a convincing case that the unity and security of the Atlantic Alliance over the next decade requires the provisionof this force. Our conclusion accordingly is that the decision whether to establish the force must follow, and cannot precede, completion of the two basic NATOstudies which are now in hand on United States initiative: the study on strategyby the NATO military authorities, and the study on force goals by the joint NATOplanning team. These studies should provide the authoritative basis for determining the future shape and size of the NATO defence effort, particularly in the nuclearfield. We are ready to do all we can to complete these studies as quickly as possible.The project for the mixed-manned force would then be seen in better perspective.We would not be committing ourselves to a new weapon system until the studiesrevealed whether or not it was a NATO requirement and whether NATO could afford it.7.   This is the line favoured by the Minister of Defence.8. The difficulty about taking this line is that the President, howeversympathetically he may understand our difficulties, may not be willing to put thewhole matter on the shelf until the NATO studies are complete, and would insist on going ahead with talks with the German, Italian and other NATO Governments.We should thus be in danger of finding ourselves excluded from the further discussions of this project and this would have unfortunate consequences for thefuture, both political and practical. To avoid this danger, the Prime Minister might take a slightly different line with the President.
Alternative B9. This would consist of developing the same arguments and proposals as are set out in Alternative A, but to add to it the proposition that if the President andother interested NATO Governments were reluctant to postpone all furtherconsideration of the mixed-manned project until next year, then we would be readyto join with them now in a Working Group to elaborate the project and all possiblevariants thereof. But this would be on the clear understanding that any decisionto establish the force or to participate in it must await the outcome of the NATOstudies.10. Under this alternative, we would not be committing ourselves finally toa new weapon system until the studies revealed whether or not it was a NATOrequirement. Nevertheless United Kingdom participation in the Working group would be taken to imply acceptance of the main concept and would make it extremely difficult to withdraw later.Alternative C11. Another possibility would be for the Prime Minister, after making thepoints in paragraph 5 above, to state that we would find it much easier to adopta constructive attitude and to convince parliamentary and public opinion of thetightness of our decision if our initial liabilities could be limited. We should beprepared to embark with the United States and other interested members of NATOon a pilot project for the mixed-manning of surface ships. We suggest that initiallythis pilot project should consist of a programme of six ships. This would enable usto test the value of mixed-manning in practice. If it succeeded we should be ableto go forward to complete the force so as to make it militarily worthwhile initself. The ultimate size and shape of the force would, however, be left open. Itcould, for example, ultimately comprise a mixed force of submarines and surface ships. We should none of us. however, make any financial commitment beyondthe pilot project, until we saw how this project itself worked out in practice. If theUnited States Government are ready to proceed initially on this limited basis,Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to take part in drafting an agreement to initiate a pilot project.12. This offers a more positive approach. On the other hand it would beopen even more strongly to the objections to Alternative B, so much so that theMinister of Defence does not think that it merits serious consideration.H.R. M.P. T.20th June, 1963.2692
Annex AVIEWS OF THE CHIEFS OF staff.   The Chiefs of Staff consider that:(a) The difficulties of mixed manning in a multilateral force could if necessary be overcome.(b) The United Kingdom manpower contribution could be met, although thiswould produce serious problems in manning the United Kingdom Polarissubmarine force and the remainder of the fleet.(c) An adequate military system for command and control could be devised.(d) The surface-ship force cannot be dismissed as a nuclear delivery system on grounds of vulnerability alone.2. They also consider however that there are the following objections on military grounds to the formation of the force:(a) Sufficiently diverse nuclear forces already exist to pose a credible deterrent to Soviet aggression.(b) Such a force would be the least credible of the different strategic nuclearsystems open to us for deterrence.(c) There are no military grounds for believing that a multilateral surface-shipforce, subject as they are advised that it would be to a United Statesveto, would diminish doubts in European countries as to whether nuclearforces would be used in defence of what they considered to be their vital interests.(d) The requirement for MRBMs in ACE has not yet been established, and is dependent on the outcome of the current strategic studies.(e) Although the force might be assigned, at least for targeting and control of fire to SACEUR, participation would inevitably lead to German navalpresence on the high seas and effective involvement in ACLANT. Thiswould have far-reaching implications both for the Western allies and forthe Soviets.(/) The formation of such a force would almost certainly lead to increased Sovietactivity at sea, and therefore increase the chances of war bymiscalculation.(g) Future countermeasures by Russia could force us to take steps which wouldchange the concept of the force from a minor and relatively inexpensivecomponent of the Western deterrent into a focal strategic feature tyingup unwarrantably large resources.(/?) The United Kingdom share of the cost of the force estimated at  85-5 million capital and  12-2 million annually would either have to beadded to our defence budget or compensating reductions would have tobe found from our forces and commitments elsewhere.3. In conclusion they believe that the provision of a NATO multilateral forceof Polaris surface ships is on military grounds entirely superfluous for the purposesof deterrence. It could in the future give rise to great difficulties and could seriouslyinterfere with the provision and deployment of our forces to meet our world-widecommitments.
Annex BFINANCIAL note the latest figures are derived from the old (April) United States document,recently circulated as C. (63) 91, together with some adjustments which we andthe Minister of Defence were making for realism at that time (and which werepartly derived from the United States document):$ millionCapital: Total in Table 6 of United States document    ......... 2,058Add: (i) Potential additional cost (mainly share of R. and D. onmissile, warhead and transit)        ............ 270(ii) Housing for families at bases       ............ 562,384=  852 million, say  855 millionRecurrent: Peak annual operating cost in Table 6 of United Statesdocument   ..................... 220Add: (i) Potential additional cost for intelligence and transitoperations     ..................... 23(ii) Modernisation of missiles, etc. (M.O.D. estimate)       ... 100343=  122 millionThese figures would correspond to a spread of United Kingdom expenditureon something like the following lines (if one assumes a United Kingdom contribution of 10 per cent):  millionYear 12 3 4 5 6 7       8 etc.(say&apos;64-65) (&apos;65-66) (&apos;66-67) (&apos;67-68) (&apos;68-69) (&apos;69-70) (&apos;70-71) (&apos;71-72)&quot; Fast plan &quot; (i:e., shipscompleted at monthly intervals)    ... 4-2       15-2     24-4     21-1      19-5      14-1      12-2      12-2&quot; Slow plan &quot; (i.e., shipscompleted at intervals of li months)       ... 3-9       14 1      20-6      18-0      16-2      17-0      14-7      12-2 15-20 million has been quoted as the rough measure of a United kingdom contribution to the mixed-manned force. It will be seen that, in the early years,this estimate is likely to be exceeded, on the basis of the capital and recurrentfigures now quoted. Moreover, it would seem that the United States figures whichhave been used have not been subjected to critical and detailed analysis, apartfrom some rough adjustments for realism. The United States document itselfemphasised the tendency for initial estimates to rise with time; and the UnitedStates figures did not purport to show the true costs of the normal total life cycleof the weapon system. (Much of the research and development and productionstart-up costs are already past but, as time went on, a bigger share of these costscould be expected to fall on the multilateral force.)
