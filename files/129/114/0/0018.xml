THE FEILDEN REPORT ON ENGINEERING DESIGNMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer am circulating this memorandum as chairman of the Economic PolicyCommittee as the problems involved seemed to the Committee to justify referenceto the Cabinet.2. The committee have had before them the attached report of a committeeappointed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to consider thepresent standing of mechanical engineering design. The report is prefaced by aletter from the Council to the Lord President which records that the committeewas appointed in accordance with his wishes and recommends publication of thereport.3. The difficulty is that the report contains a number of quotations fromevidence which strongly criticise engineering design in our industries, including some on which a large part of our export effort depends. Instances of thesecriticisms are in paragraphs 32, 33, 37, 38, 39 and 40. There are others also.4. The President of the Board of Trade raised this matter because he thinks(and is confirmed in this opinion by the majority opinion in his Advisory group on Exports and his Engineering Advisory Council) that the criticisms will be exploited, out of context, by our overseas competitors to weaken our place in world markets. The President has told the committee that in his view the damagingpassages should be omitted from the published text, or amended.5. The Lord President has told the committee that, on the ground that it isessential for the Minister of Science to respect and defend the constitutionalindependence of the Research Councils, he is opposed to attempting to alter the text of the report. To do so would, in his view, raise issues of principle between him and the Research Councils which would be quite disproportionate to the valueof any delay obtained; and he would be unable himself to justify it to Parliament.6.   He has also made the following points:&quot; (i) The report has of necessity already passed through many hands and itwould be quite impossible to defer publication or alter the textsignificantly. Experience has shown that any attempt to interfere withpublication always leads to a leak which causes redoubled impact tothe points one tries to delete and exposes the Government to the chargeof suppressing or tampering with the terms of a report by technical experts for political reasons. In any case the report has been printedas the Stationery Office&apos;s final version for publication.(ii) I am profoundly out of sympathy with the idea that it is ultimately tothe interests either of exports or of industry to cover up or paper overdefects revealed by a report of this nature.(iii) I do not believe the report will in fact damage British exports. Foreignbuyers are shrewd and our goods will sell on their quality and thequality of our salesmanship.(iv) There is no advantage in delay; the findings will be as unpalatable andimplementation as urgent whenever they are published.(v) The widest dissemination of the report is essential for its implementation,as this will depend at least as much on teaching institutes, industry and professional associations as on Government departments.&quot;2786Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1963C. (63) 118 Copy No.   g 29th July, 1963CABINET
7. My committee generally shares the view of the President of the Board ofTrade that publication of the report in its present form is liable to damage our export drive and that it will be resented by industry. But some members alsothink that this would be outweighed by the benefit to be expected from a sharpstimulus to industry to improve the standard of our engineering design.8. In any event, however, there was wide agreement in the committee thatit would not be expedient now to try to withhold the report, or parts of it, frompublication or to seek to amend it. It is known too widely already, to the membersof the Feilden Committee, to the witnesses, to the members of the Council for scientific and Industrial Research, and to staff in the Department of scientific and Industrial Research; and, because of a mistake in the arrangements forwithholding it from publication last week for Ministers&apos; consideration, a copy wassold across the Stationery Office counter. There has never been any suggestionthat the study might not result in publication of a report. The Press would be likelyto attack the more vigorously if they thought that the text had been altered.9. The prevailing view in the committee is, therefore, that our problem is how best to present the report as it stands. The Minister without Portfolio hasbeen invited to put proposals before the Cabinet for this purpose.10. It has been established that it would be possible to postpone publicationfor a few days beyond 11th July, up to about 18th July, though with increasingrisk of premature disclosure. But there is to be a Supply day debate on sciencein the House of Commons on Monday, 15th July.11. Behind this present case lies the wider question whether there is anychange that could be made in our present arrangements for commissioning studiesby outside bodies to prevent repetition of our difficulty.R. M.Treasury Chambers, S.V/. 1,8th July, 1963.
