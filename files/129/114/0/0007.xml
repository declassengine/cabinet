Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1963C. (63) 107 Copy No.   6326th June, 1963CABINETTHE FINANCING OF UNITED NATIONS PEACE-KEEPINGOPERATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe memoranda which I submitted to the Cabinet on 28th February (C. (63) 29)C.C. (63) 14th Conclusions, Minute 7) and on 14th March (C. (63) 43) (C.C. (63)16th Conclusions, Minute 5) contained certain proposals for financing the united nations peace-keeping operations in the Middle East and the Congo for the rest of1963 and for long-term arrangements. The Cabinet agreed that instructions shouldbe sent to the United Kingdom delegation in New York to proceed on the lines ofthese proposals, and I feel it would now be appropriate to report for the informationof my colleagues, on subsequent developments.2. The first stage comprised discussions in a Working Group of 21 member states which was appointed by the General Assembly at its Seventeenth session to look into the problem of the United Nations&apos; finances and to report to the FourthSpecial Session of the Assembly which has now been meeting since 14th May. Inthe course of these discussions United Kingdom representatives put forward two proposals. The first was a plan for financing the Congo and the Middle Eastoperations until the end of 1963 which envisaged raising the necessary funds on an ad hoc and almost entirely compulsory basis. The second proposal related to thelong-term financing of peace-keeping operations, and its essential point was that itsought, without compromising the letter or the spirit of the Charter, to overcome the difficulties arising from the refusal of members to pay for operations to whichthey objected for political reasons.3. The Working Group was unable to make any agreed recommendations to the Special Session. Its report, therefore, largely comprised a straightforwardaccount of the various views and proposals put forward, notable amongst whichwere the proposals of the United Kingdom and an interesting procedure suggestedby a number of developing countries for the collection of arrears from all members in default. The report did, however, reflect a broad measure of agreement on some general principles.4. When the Special Session opened on 14th May there was general agreement that the Assembly should concentrate on finding solutions to the problems of financing the Congo and Middle East operations until the end of 1963 and oncollecting arrears, leaving detailed discussion of long-term arrangements to theEighteenth Session. It was also generally accepted that delegations should as faras possible avoid taking up rigid public positions. Accordingly, public statementsso far have been of a general nature and all serious negotiation has been conductedthrough intensive informal consultations between representatives of the Western,Latin American and Afro-Asian groups. As a result of this, provisional agreement(dependent on approval by Governments) has been reached on five draft resolutions.The first two of these resolutions cover the financing of the Congo and Middle Eastoperations for the last six months of 1963; the third sets out a procedure for thepayment of arrears; the fourth establishes certain general principles which should govern the financing of peace-keeping operations in the future; and the fifth extend to 31st December, 1963, the Secretary-General&apos;s authority to sell bonds. There isalso a chance that a further resolution may be introduced asking the Secretary-General to study the feasibility of setting up a voluntary peace-keeping fund. Wewould support this resolution but express reservations on the desirability orpracticability of such a fund.2707THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
The Financing Resolutions and Bond Issue5. Under these resolutions costs for the last six months of 1963 of the Congooperation ($33 million) and the Middle East operation ($9,500,000) would be metas follows:(a) $3 million (Congo operation) and $2,500,000 (Middle East operation) wouldbe apportioned among all members according to the percentage scale of their contributions to the regular budget;(b) $30 million (Congo operation) and $7 million (Middle East operation) wouldalso be apportioned in the first instance among all members according tothe percentage scale of their contributions to the regular budget. the assessment thus arrived at in respect of each &quot; economically less developed country &quot; would then be abated by 55 per cent; it is furtherstated that &quot; this apportionment shall constitute an ad hoc arrangement for the present phase of this peace-keeping operation and shall not constitute a precedent for the future &quot;.(c) the short-fall thus caused would be made good by voluntary contributions from those members not entitled to rebates. These voluntary contributions would be credited to a special account and only transferredprogressively to the Congo and Middle East accounts as and whenmembers enjoying rebates paid their contributions.6. The figures under (a) above are lower than those proposed in the UnitedKingdom&apos;s original draft plan, while the relief granted to the under-developedmembers is slightly greater. The United States have undertaken to contribute50 per cent of the voluntary contributions required to make up the short fall andthe United Kingdom share will be in the region of $520,000.7. We support the &quot; bond &quot; resolution although we do not, ourselves, intend to buy any more bonds.Resolution on the Collection of Arrears8. This resolution is based on a paper tabled in the Working Group of twenty-one by the representatives of the Argentine, Brazil, Cameroon, Nigeria,India and Pakistan (see paragraph 3 above). The main point of the resolution isthat all members in default, without exception, are called upon to pay their arrearswith the least possible delay; those who consider that they have a genuine case on financial grounds for being accorded special facilities for payment are invited to consult with the Secretary-General with a view to arranging such facilities; thosewho have refused to contribute on political grounds are invited, in view of the critical state of the organisation^ finances, to pay off their arrears without prejudice to their respective positions.Resolution on General Principles9. Though, as stated in paragraph 4 above, there has been general agreement that detailed arrangements for financing after the end of 1963 should be left forconsideration until the Eighteenth Session of the General Assembly, it hasnevertheless been widely accepted that there would be advantage now in establishing,if possible, some broad principles. These have been incorporated in the fourthdraft resolution. They include acceptance of the collective responsibility of all members for the financing of peace-keeping operations; recognition that, at anearly stage, assessments should be closely related to capacity to pay; recognition invague terms of the special position of the permanent members of the security council; acceptance of the need to give special consideration &quot; where circumstanceswarrant to the situation of member States which are victims of, and those which are otherwise involved in, the events or actions leading to a peace-keeping operation &quot;;and the encouragement of voluntary contributions. The resolution also requests theSecretary-General to report to the Assembly at its Eighteenth Session on possible improvements in financial procedures to be followed when peace-keeping operations are authorised.Comments10. These resolutions are by no means perfect from the point of view of theUnited Kingdom. They do, however, have the support of an overwhelming majorityof the members of the Assembly. This constitutes, I believe, their great value. Indeed,
given the divergence of interest and views between the various groups, it is very satisfactory and encouraging that so wide a measure of agreement has been reached.We would, of course, have liked to see universal agreement. At an early stage inthe Assembly&apos;s proceedings, however, it became evident that the attitude of theSoviet Union and of its partners had hardened. Not only did they reiterate their refusal to pay anything towards the Congo and Middle East operations, but theyannounced their intention not to contribute in future to certain other activities ofthe United Nations which could broadly be described as of a peace-keeping nature and which are financed from the regular budget. (These are the United NationsTruce Supervisory Organisation in the Middle East, the United Nations commission for the Unification of Korea, the United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Korea, andthe United Nations Field Mission.) In view of this intransigence the best tactics were clearly to work for resolutions commanding the support of an overwhelming majority of members and thus to isolate the Soviet bloc in opposition.11. The intensive negotiations to that end which have taken place over thelast few weeks between representatives of the Western, Afro-Asian and latin american groups, and in which the United Kingdom played a leading part, havebeen characterised by moderation and commonsense on the part of all. The resultingresolutions embody much that is sensible and useful; they reflect an encouraginglysincere attempt on behalf of the majority of members to restore the financial stability of the Organisation and to preserve its capacity for effective action: in so far asfinancing of the Congo and the Middle East operations are concerned, the UnitedKingdom proposal was taken as a basis for discussion and has, in the main, beenpreserved in its original form, and, if the resolutions are implemented, they will go far to isolate the Soviet bloc and to pin upon them the responsibility for wreckingor preserving the peace-keeping function of the United Nations. The isolation ofthe bloc in this respect is likely to be of the greatest importance when the time comesfor the Soviet Union to lose its vote under Article 19 of the Charter. I think,therefore, that we can regard the results of the Special Session of the Assembly asbeing broadly satisfactory and as giving some grounds for hope that the questionof financing peace-keeping operations will from now on be approached by themajority of members with a better understanding of the issues involved and a readieracceptance of their responsibilities.12. I propose when the resolutions have been adopted in plenary to presenta White Paper to Parliament outlining the results of the Special Session.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,24th June, 1963.
