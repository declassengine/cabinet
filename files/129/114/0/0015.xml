Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1963C. (63) 1158th July, 1963Copy No.   6 6CABINETSOUTH AFRICA AND THE UNITED nations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs as the Lord Privy Seal proposed in a memorandum (C. (63) 59) of 29th Marchwe have been discussing with the United States the best tactics to deal with an extreme resolution on apartheid which may be put forward when the security council meets towards the end of this month.2. Mr. Pvusk confirmed recently that the United States remain opposed to continue sanctions on South Africa and are prepared to work with us, if necessary,to resist them. I think there is a good chance, therefore, that we shall have sufficient support to deal with a sanctions resolution without having to consider the use ofour veto.3. The position will be more difficult if, as is likely, a more limited resolution is submitted confined to arms supplies or if a separate vote is taken on a paragraphabout arms supplies in a general resolution. Although the United States have not committed themselves to oppose a total arms embargo in all circumstances, theyare prepared to work with us against such an embargo provided that we find it possible to join with them in sponsoring a moderate alternative.4. There is some danger in supporting any resolution on arms, even if the wording were consistent with our present policy, since it might be held to imply that we were taking the first steps towards coercing South Africa. But isolation onthe issue of an arms embargo (which the United States might accept and on which,in Sir Patrick Dean&apos;s view, the French would abstain) would cause us very serious embarrassment. A resolution providing for such an embargo might well be inmandatory terms. In these circumstances the best course seems to be to try to workout with the United States an acceptable alternative.5.   Mr. Rusk has suggested that a resolution should cover three main points:(a) condemnation of apartheid;(b) a recommendation to Governments not to supply arms to South Africawhich would facilitate the enforcement of apartheid; and(c) a recommendation for the appointment by the United Nations of arapporteur to deal with the South African problem.(a) would cause us little difficulty and (c) would probably be ineffective.6. I have accordingly instructed our delegation in New York to explorewith the United States delegation the drafting of a formula on (b) which woulddistinguish in acceptable terms between arms suitable for applying apartheid andother arms. If a moderate resolution on these lines is in the event adopted by theSecurity Council, it would, I think, require only minor alterations in our present practice regarding arms deliveries. In the correspondence in 1961 between theMinister of Defence, Mr. Watkinson and his South African counterpart, Mr.Fouche, about the continuation of our defence arrangements with South Africa,we said that there should be no serious difficulty about continued arms supplies2781
with the exception of small arms and small arms ammunition. In practice our policy has been somewhat more favourable to the South Africans. Although wehave refused or asked them to withdraw official orders for small arms (for example the recent revolver order) we have continued to authorise such orders from privatedealers. It may be necessary to tighten up in this respect to avoid accusations of inconsistency should a resolution be adopted. But in view of the terms of Mr.Watkinson&apos;s letter referred to above, this could not affect major orders, forexample the Buccaneers; nor could it give the South Africans cause for complaint that we are acting contrary to the spirit of our defence arrangements. Therewould be some marginal cases but I think we could manage to deal with themsensibly.7. A moderate Security Council resolution would also have some positiveadvantages. It would make it easier to demonstrate to opinion at home and abroadthat we are not being more liberal than other countries in supplying arms to SouthAfrica. At the same time it would show the South Africans that we were not being more restrictive than other countries and thus perhaps reduce the likelihood oftheir diverting orders from this country as a result of recent public statements.8. If therefore we can agree on a formula with the United States, I proposeto authorise the delegation in New York to join with them in supporting it.H.Foreign Office, S.W.1,5th July, 1963.
