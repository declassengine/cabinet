C. (63) 147 Copy No.5th September, 1963CABINETPAY OF THE HIGHER CIVIL service memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general on 9th February this year Lord Franks, Chairman of the Standing AdvisoryCommittee on the Remuneration of the Higher Civil Service, informed the PrimeMinister that his Committee had decided to undertake a review of the pay of theHigher Civil Service. This decision was in accordance with the Committee&apos;s termsof reference which require it, &quot; in the exercise of its general oversight of the remuneration of the Higher Civil Service, to advise the Government, either atthe latter&apos;s request or on its own initiative, on what changes are desirable in the remuneration of these officers &quot;. Lord Franks has now written to the Prime Ministerto inform him that the Committee has completed its review and recommends certainsalary increases for all grades of the Higher Civil Service. A copy of his letter isat Annex.2. In terms of the administrative class the present salaries (national), the recommended salaries, the amount and the percentage of the increases are asfollows:	Present	Recommended	Amount of	Per cent	Salary	Salary	Increase	Increase	 	 	 	Assistant Secretary      ......	2,650-3,350*	3,050-3,900	400-550	15-16JUnder-Secretary	4,050	4,700	650	16Deputy Secretary        ......	4,950	5,800	850	17Permanent Secretary (ordinary)	6,950	8,200	1,250	18Permanent Secretary to Treasury				or Cabinet Office	7,450	8,800	1,350	18* This salary scale was increased ad interim by  150 on the recommendation of the Committeelast February, but for the purpose of this memorandum comparisons are made with the pre-Februaryscale.The salaries of the other classes (legal, scientific, etc.) would be increased similarly.The Committee recommends that the revised salaries be given effect from 1st August,1963. The estimated cost for all classes is  2 million a year, and the total number ofstaff affected is 6,100.3. This is the Committee&apos;s second general review. The first took place in1958 and early 1959. It resulted in revised salary scales with effect from 1st February,1959. In the summer of 1960 a pay research survey for the administrative class(which had taken place in 1958 and 1959) led to a decision again to increase the salaries of the Assistant Secretary and the Under-Secretary. This further increase was also given to the Assistant Secretary from 1st February, 1959, but the Under-Secretary received it only from 1st July, 1960, simply because retrospection wasconsidered inappropriate for such a senior grade even though the date of the evidencepointed to an increase from early 1959.4. The increases now recommended may therefore be fairly regarded as thefirst for A\ years. They range from 15 per cent at the minimum of the Assistant3116Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1963
Secretary scale to 18 per cent for the Permanent Secretary. The average annual rateof increase over the whole field is about 3i per cent. There is some ground for believing that this reflects something less than would be indicated by strictcomparison with what has occurred in outside employment during the period. LordFranks emphasises that the scale of increases is firmly supported by the evidence before the Committee and includes no element which would depend for itsjustification on an assumption that there will be inflation in the economy in thefuture. Even so, the Committee expect the salary scale they recommend to remainin force &quot; for some time to come &quot;, and it may be assumed that they have in mindaVeriod such as they have now considered. On both these points the Committee&apos;attitude is stricter than that of the Review Body on the Remuneration of doctors and Dentists.5. Nevertheless such increases cannot but raise a question of increases forsome other groups:(a) Interest in the pay of Ministers and Members of Parliament might be revived. The Cabinet have already decided (C.C. (63) 18th Conclusions,Minute 1) that these salaries should not be increased during the life-time of the present Parliament, and the House of Commons has been so informed.(b) The pay of the lower judiciary normally moves with that of the higher civil Service.(c) There is no formal link between the pay of the Higher Civil Service and members of Nationalised Boards, but the pay of the latter has not been revised since July 1957 and will in any case have to be reviewed shortly.(d) The pay of university academic staff is under review by the national incomes Commission, who will no doubt take the changes in CivilService pay into account.(e) The pay of the Armed Services is due to be reviewed early next year, and what is done for the Higher Civil Service must then influence the pay of senior officers in the Services.6. The Committee is, of course, an advisory body and the recommendations are not binding on the Government. The Priestley Commission, however, thoughtthat it would be &quot; most unlikely that the Government will fail to take action when such a Committee tenders advice &quot;. The Committee was set up to give independentadvice on the pay of the Higher Civil Service; and it seems to be extremely difficult for the Government to reject or vary its recommendations without the mostcompelling reasons. I do not myself see any such reasons on this occasion.7. I therefore hope that my colleagues will agree that the recommendationsof the Committee should be accepted. The timing of any announcement will,however, require thought. It would be unfortunate if the announcement coincided with a critical stage in the negotiations on one of the large industrial wage claimsnow outstanding, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I would therefore wishto have discretion to settle the precise timing of the announcement. Other thingsbeing equal, there would be advantages in an early announcement, since the effective date recommended by the Committee is 1st August, and it is particularly desirable in respect of salaries at this level to avoid giving the appearance of retrospection.J.

secret annex* *        * *        *Dear Prime Minister, 3Jst July, 1963.As Chairman of the Standing Advisory Committee on Pay of the Higher CivilService I wrote to you on 9th February to tell you that we had decided that the time had come for us to look again at the pay of the higher Civil Service as a whole. I am now writing to give you our recommendations.2. Our last general review was held in 1958. We started it in May of that yearand finished it in January 1959. Our recommendations were brought into effect from 1st February, 1959.3. In July 1960 we sent you recommendations on a number of matters whichhad been put to us in that month, arising from agreements between the treasury and the Staff Associations concerning the pay of the Administrative and ExecutiveClasses up to the level of Principal and Chief Executive Officer, and from informationcollected in 1958 by the Civil Service Pay Research Unit. Our recommendations,which v/ere accepted, were for increases in the pay of Assistant Secretaries as from 1st February, 1959, and for Under-Secretaries as from 1st July, 1960, with relatedincreases in the Executive and other Classes. We expressed at the time, as regardsUnder-Secretaries, our view that the increase should be limited to the amountnecessary to maintain reasonable salary differentials between the top of the assistant secretary scale and the Under-Secretary level until such time as there might be afurther general review.4. In my letter of 9th February I referred to a joint memorandum by theOfficial and Staff Sides. This had invited us to consider not only whether we should hold a fresh general review but also, in the light of our view on that point, whether we would recommend an immediate increase ad interim. We recommended interim increase for the ranks below Under-Secretary and its equivalent in other Classesas from 1st January, 1963, to resolve difficulties that had arisen from the compressionof differentials below the rank of Assistant Secretary and its equivalent. Thisrecommendation was also accepted.5. The business of this latest review has occupied us in seven meetings. Wehave had before us again the findings of the Priestley Royal Commission relatingto the higher Civil Service. We have received memoranda from the National staff side and from the Official Side, and from a number of Staff Associations. We have obtained information from many sources relating to levels of pay, to the movementof pay since our previous general review, and to other matters, in both the public and private sectors; and the form of this material has enabled us to considerspecifically those with professional or other special qualifications. We are particularly grateful to those who have given us much confidential information tohelp us in our task.6. When we sent you the conclusions of our previous general review inFebruary 1959 we said that we hoped that our recommendations would make afurther general review of the higher Civil Service pay unnecessary for some timeto come. We entertain the same hopes on this occasion.7. Having examined the evidence and considered the representations, wehave concluded that, looking at the remuneration of the higher Civil Service as awhole, or of the individual Classes, we should not be justified in making recommendations that would amount to a revaluation in relation to other walks of life. Nor have we concerned ourselves with grading of individual posts, which is amatter for the Treasury and the Departments. Our attention was drawn to benefits in kind; we have found no evidence that these are relatively any more or less important than they were before in the relationship between Civil Service pay andthat of other employments. But we are satisfied from our studies of pay historiesin the Civil Service and in other employments, and on wider grounds of publicinterest, that this is the occasion to recognise afresh the difference in degree ofresponsibility between ranks within the higher Civil Service. Our recommendationstherefore embody, within the scale of increases that we consider to be justified,some widening of differentials.
8. We have noted how successive increases in the pay of Principals andequivalent grades since the last general review have compressed the differentialsbetween those grades and the grades in our field. We think that our recommendations will establish a differential between the pay of Principals andAssistant Secretaries and of comparable grades in other Classes that will be appropriate for the outset of this new periodical settlement and will accord with thescale of increases that we consider to be justified on other grounds.9. This scale of increases is firmly supported by the evidence before us. it includes no element that would depend for its justification on an assumption thatthere will be inflation in the economy in future. We have satisfied ourselves, so faras we can, that we have not overlooked any factors of importance to the publicinterest whatever the direction in which they point.10. We recommend that, with effect from 1st August, 1963, the pay of thehigher grades of the Administrative Class should be as follows:Joint Permanent Secretaries to the Treasury and secretary of the Cabinet       .........  8,800Other Permanent Secretaries       .........  8,200Deputy Secretary    ...............  5,800Under-Secretary      ......      .........  4,700Assistant Secretary...............  3,050- 3,90011. We recommend that corresponding increases should be made in the pay of other Classes in the higher Civil Service. We are satisfied that these will produce a suitable relationship between the pay of these Classes within the Civil Service andsuch groups as can be regarded as broadly comparable outside.12. We assume that the National Staff Side will be told the terms of our recommendations.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)      OLIVER FRANKS.% %i ^ % %
