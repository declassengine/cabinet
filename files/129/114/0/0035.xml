Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1963C. (63) 135 Copy No.23rd July, 1963CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT REORGANISATION1Memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh affairs at their meeting on 19th July, the Home Affairs Committee considered my proposal to accept the plans of the English Local Government Commission forthe amalgamations of Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely; Huntingdonshire andthe Soke of Peterborough (which I shall refer to as the &quot; four counties &quot;); andRutland and Leicestershire and asked that I should bring these before the Cabinet.The arguments on merits for adopting these proposals can be stated briefly.The Four Counties2. The Local Government Commission originally suggested that CambridgeCity (population 92,000), the only big town in the whole area, should become a county borough as it badly wants to do; and that the four counties should be amalgamated into one.3. This pleased no one except the city; and after discussions with all theauthorities concerned, the Commission produced final proposals for leavingCambridge City as it is a non-county borough-and making two counties outof the four; Huntingdonshire (85.000) and the Soke of Peterborough (77.000) inone, Cambridgeshire (193,000) and the Isle of Ely (89,000) in another.^)4. At the subsequent public enquiry Huntingdonshire, the Soke andCambridgeshire agreed to this. The Isle of Ely continued to oppose anyamalgamation, and said they disliked the two-county amalgamation even morethan the four-county. Cambridge City continued to press for county boroughstatus.5. I am sure that the Commission^ final proposals provide the right solution.County government here badly needs strengthening and unless we are to abandonany attempt at reorganising local government in the rural areas the two-countyScheme is the least we can do. As explained, it commands considerable support.Cambridge City will be much annoyed, and will argue that the solution isshort-sighted since they cannot indefinitely be denied county borough status.However that may be, I think it is defensible (and will be a considerable relief to apprehensive county councils elsewhere) to leave the city as it is for thetime being. Ely will protest; but this&apos;is a weak county with a poor administration,and there is no evidence of any strong body of local support for the county council.Rutland6. It is difficult to see how we could accept the Commission^ proposals forthe four counties while, at the same time, rejecting or deferring decision on their proposals for Rutland. The four counties range in size from 77,000 to 193,000.Rutland&apos;s population is 25,000. Everything we say about the need to strengthencounty administration in the four counties and I shall need to make this explicitin giving my reasons for rejecting the Isle of Ely&apos;s objections will be seen to apply with still greater force to Rutland. At the same time, it will greatly help the presentation of the decision on Rutland if it is accompanied by the decision onthe four counties. We shall be able to show that Rutland is not being singled out,(&apos;) East Midlands General Review Area: Report and proposals; July 1961.2858
while the acquiescence of the Soke, Huntingdonshire and Cambridgeshire willdemonstrate that some small counties recognise that there is advantage to be gained by amalgamation.Implementing the Decisions7. Affirmative resolution orders, containing much consequential detail, willbe needed to give effect to our decisions. These can certainly be ready in time tobecome operative in April 1965. There is a good chance that the Rutland order,which is less complicated, could be ready for early next session, with an operative date of April 1964. In any event, I would aim to present orders for all these mattersearly enough next year to enable me to include provision cancelling the countyelections due in April 1964 for the counties affected, just as we have done in theLondon Government Bill for the 1964 elections in the Home Counties.Announcement of decisions before the recess would be essential to this programme.I do not think that the incidence of the county council elections could be made tojustify the deferment of decisions for nearly three years, as would be necessary here.At most it is only a minor inconvenience to have to hold elections for the new authorities in other years than those of county elections.The Issue8. In London and the Black Country we have shown our determination toimprove the system of local government in the great built-up areas. The need tomodernise the administrative structure in the county areas is hardly less pressing.If we are to continue to rely on the administrative counties to play an effective partin the rapidly developing social services, we must see that they are equippedfinancially and technically to do the job. Rutland is an administrative nonsense asthe means of providing services of the range and complexity expected of localgovernment to-day. This is well understood in local government circles; it was indeed implicit in our undertaking a fully comprehensive review in 1958 that the structure of the county areas no less than that of the big cities was in need ofoverhaul. Rutland is the test case. It is by our action or inaction on this issue thatour determination to make a thorough job of modernising the local government machine will be judged.9. I know of no reason which could be given with any conviction for deferringuntil after the general election decisions on issues as simple and clear-cut as thoseraised by these proposals, now two years old. The only other decisions of anyconsequence which can be made during this Parliament concern the demotion to non-county borough status of Burton upon Trent, limited boundary extensions fora few county boroughs Coventry, Leicester, Northampton and Stoke-on-Trentand a sizeable county boundary alteration at Tamworth. I shall be able to givedecisions on most of these soon. But these are run-of-the-mill boundary changes andit would astonish the local government world if we did other than carry them through. The reorganisation process is a continuing one, and will go on throughoutthe next Parliament and perhaps beyond. Decisions will be needed for the whole ofEngland and Wales outside the Midlands. In particular, Tyneside, Merseyside,South-East Lancashire, the West Riding&quot; arid&quot; the Welsh counties will presentproblems of special difficulty. No case can be made for leaving over the presentissues as well. The reviews of country districts by the county councils will also throwup issues for decision starting early in the next Parliament.10. I feel sure we cannot do nothing. I am equally sure that our reputation forfearlessly seeking efficiency in the administration of public services will be enhanced by decisions to carry through these amalgamations. Conversely, a failure to act now would be widely construed as weakness.Conclusion11. I ask my colleagues to agree to the announcement, before the recess, of decisions to adopt the proposals for county amalgamations set out in paragraph 1..   K.
