Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1963Copy No. 6 9CABINETFORECAST ESTIMATES, 1964-65Memorandum by the Minister without PortfolioIn considering the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper on Forecast Estimates, 1964-65(C. (63) 125), I think we ought to decide not only, in terms of paragraph 14, what we should do in the next six months, but also what we should say in public about this trend.2. The figures he quotes in paragraph 7 are common knowledge up to and including the year 1963-64. Indeed they are a matter for comment among informedpublicists and are likely to become progressively more topical during the next6-12 months.3. I think we shall find it difficult to comply with the conditions of paragraph13, particularly the last, (c). We must therefore either appear to be victims of circumstances outside our control or justify more strongly the present trend ofpublic expenditure.4. It is tempting to conclude that the less we say for the moment the better.I believe this would be a mistake. The right approach while we still hold theinitiative is to start now an approach to public education on this subject. Given this initiative and a right emphasis it could be made an incentive to growth: Thealternative to &quot; stop and go &quot; is to explain the implications of &quot; go &quot; and get public support for it.5. We are at present engaged in a series of broadsheets for public consumptionunder Government auspices explaining the requirements of an expanding economy,and they enjoy a rising circulation. I would like to introduce into this series theproblem of public expenditure and to break down the present not the prospective increase and present it in the context of our current theme on economic growth.We have ahead of us a few weeks in which this project can be thoughtfully worked out with a view to resuming this series of broadsheets on these lines in the early autumn.W. D.C. (63) 12916th July, 1963Office of the Minister without Portfolio, S.W. 1,16th July, 1963.2825
