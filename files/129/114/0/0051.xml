secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1963C. (63) 151 Copy No. 7 016th September, 1963CABINETTHE MULTILATERAL FORCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs apologise to my colleagues for the length of this paper but I am very anxious that all the arguments for and against participation in a multilateral force shouldbe before the Cabinet.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,12th September, 1963.THE MULTILATERAL FORCEBackgroundWhen the Cabinet on 11th July (C.C. (63) 46th Conclusions, Minute 5)discussed my memorandum (C. (63) 121), &quot;The NATO Nuclear Force: the NextStep &quot;, they invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with me, to arrangefor a study of the arrangements for the management and control of nuclear weaponsat the disposal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) which it wouldbe in our interest to advocate.2. Officials of our two Departments have been in consultation over thisquestion but as there have been a number of new developments, particularly inthe international field, I think it may be useful to my colleagues if I set out thepresent position as I see it in the light of those consultations.3. The Cabinet took the decision to which I have referred shortly afterPresident Kennedy&apos;s visit to Birch Grove, at which he and the Prime minister agreed, among other things, that &quot; a basic problem facing the NATO Alliance wasthe closer association of its members with the nuclear deterrent of the alliance.&quot;They also agreed that various possible ways of meeting this problem should befurther discussed with their allies. Such discussions would include the proposalfor a multilateral sea-borne force, without prejudice to the question of UnitedKingdom participation in such a force.Recent developments4. Our general feeling at the time was that the United States Governmentwere less eager to press on with the multilateral force than we had previouslythought. Since then a number of things have happened:(a) Shortly after the Cabinet meeting on 11th July I had an opportunity to talk about this problem in London with Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassadorsat Paris and Bonn and the United Kingdom Permanent representative to NATO. While they all emphasised the importance of meeting theGerman problem they agreed that we should consider further whetherthis could be done without bringing a new force into being. doubts were also expressed whether it was desirable even to create a NATONuclear Control Commission on the lines set out in my memorandum c. (63) 1.21, since this would inevitably, in present circumstances,exclude the French and might be resented as setting up an alliancewithin the alliance. We concluded that as a first step we might consider3152a
building on the existing machinery of the NATO Nuclear Committee.The Ministry of Defence, however, thought that the scope for the nuclear Committee in this field would appear to be very limited andv Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington advised that the idea wouldnot at that stage at any rate commend itself to the United States,who would think that we were trying to undo the work which they hadalready done with the Germans. This indeed became very clear from my discussions with Mr. Rusk in Moscow. He said there that theUnited States Government had committed their prestige and their good name to the Germans on the multilateral force and they couldnot go back; indeed he was inclined to reproach us for having changedour attitude since the Nassau meeting, when he said the americans had genuinely believed that we had accepted the concept of a mixed-manned force, and he reminded us that the Minister of Defence inthe House of Commons and I myself at the North Atlantic Councilon 20th March had welcomed the idea of such a force. The Americans&apos;determination to press ahead is reflected in their loss of interest in non--dissemination as an early subject for discussion with the Russians,since they see no prospect of convincing the Russians that the multilateral force is compatible with non-dissemination and they arenot prepared to compromise on the multilateral force for the sake of reaching a non-dissemination agreement.(b) The German Foreign Minister came to see me on 14th August and I didmy best to lay bare German motives. I put to him as forcibly as i could the political and technical arguments against the multilateral force and I pressed him to say whether the German requirements would not be better met by some different form of military solutionor by a solution in the field of political control. Dr. Schroeder argued that Germany had no share and no say in nuclear matters; this was for them a political problem to which a para-military solution had tobe found. A political solution such as a Nuclear Control Committeein NATO would not go far enough. While he was prepared to beopen-minded on the make-up of the multilateral force and to see itsweapons found from existing resources, he could see no better methodthan the multilateral force and I was quite unable to divert him fromgoing along with it. We must conclude that the Germans regard themselves as committed to the multilateral force.(c) The State Department in Washington have initiated a series of discussions with representatives of other Governments interested in the force,namely, those of Germany, Italy, Greece and Turkey. We were invitedto send observers to these talks but did not do so. We have, however,been kept informed. The State Department circulated at these talksa paper, of which they gave us a copy, entitled &quot; Basic Elements of aM.L.F. Charter &quot;, which sets out in summary form the shape of theforce as they see it, including the arrangements for ownership and management, political control over firing of weapons and finance.Provision is also made for a planning group which would continueto make preparations for bringing the force into being while thenecessary political decisions were being taken. Towards the end ofAugust the Italians suggested that discussion should be continued intwo groups: first a steering group to deal with political and legalquestions, meeting in Paris, and secondly a sub-group to deal with military and technical problems, meeting in Washington. It now seems likely that the steering group will meet mainly in Paris and thesub-group in Washington, starting work in October. The americans have prepared draft terms of reference for the two groups, which arenow under discussion in the Washington talks. The Italians have indicated that their participation in the groups would not necessarilyimply a commitment to take part in the eventual force. The first paragraph of the United States draft terms of reference for the steering group reads as follows:&quot; Those NATO countries which are seriously interested in creating a multilateral force, and which are prepared at this timeto enter into detailed discussions with that end in view, would be
represented. At the same time, however, it would be understoodthat final national decisions to participate in the force must be deferred pending an opportunity for Governments to review theresults of these discussions which will determine the character ofthe force. The Secretary-General of NATO would be invited tosend an observer to these discussions and would, in any event, bekept informed of their progress.&quot;5. We are now faced, therefore., with a situation in which it is more thanlikely that the multilateral for^e will come into being whatever attitude we adoptto it. Even though it will initially at any rate be formed outside NATO it will ineffect be a major new development in the nuclear arrangements of the alliance.Moreover, the main protagonists of the idea are the United States and federal german Governments, our relations with whom are of particular importance tous both in the Atlantic and European fields. It is therefore essential, in my view,that we should consider carefully our attitude to the force itself and the position which we are to take in discussing it with the United States and Germany.Attitude of other Governments6. The positions of the other Governments concerned can be summarisedas follows:(a) The United States Government, having committed their prestige to theirpresent proposals, are pressing them hard. They believe that there isa real danger of Germany in the future somehow or other obtainingcontrol of nuclear weapons, possibly with French assistance. The UnitedStates Government therefore would not support any scheme that didnot meet this danger or satisfy the Germans. Despite their desire tomeet German political requirements, however, there are no signs thatthe United States Government would surrender the final United Statesveto on the use of nuclear weapons of United States origin. They see no alternative to mixed-manning as a means of admitting the germans to joint ownership while preventing exclusive German control of nuclear weapons. Moreover, they consider it necessary that participantsshould make a significant investment, both as a sign of ownership andto commit to the M.L.F. German resources which might otherwise be diverted to national nuclear purposes.(b) The Germans regard it as politically essential to escape from their presentposition of inferiority to the other major Powers. They do not go sofar as to say that they wish to control nuclear weapons and indeedDr. Schroeder assured me they did not, but. they do want to seeGermans playing a part in a joint enterprise. For them the first priorityis to retain a close connection with the United States and to ensurecontinued United States commitment to the defence of Western Europe.This predisposes them to do what they think the Americans want themto. They are well disposed to us but not prepared to agree with us atthe cost of disagreeing with the Americans. The present GermanGovernment genuinely wish to safeguard against future pressure on them to acquire control over nuclear weapons either independently orin association with France and they hope to achieve this through anarrangement whereby there is an outward and physical sign of german influence on the use of the West&apos;s ultimate strategic deterrent. TheGermans appear to believe that the American veto will either be watereddown or can be concealed enough to meet their political requirements.(c) Both the United States and Germany are anxious that the United kingdom should take a significant part in the M.L.F. but our absence will notstop them going ahead with one or two other members of NATO.(d) France will have nothing to do with the multilateral force. She is pursuingher own national nuclear force and has shown no interest in any ideaswhich might involve a limitation on her nuclear independence.(e) Of the other NATO countries. Italy with a caretaker Government cannotcommit herself but will probably go along with the force; she would prefer to see us in rather than join a predominantly German-UnitedStates force. The Greeks and Turks will join provided the United States3152
pays their subscriptions, which she seems willing to do. The Belgiansand Dutch would be reluctant to go in if this meant an increase intheir defence budgets, but are obviously restive at the idea of the forcebeing formed outside NATO and outside their own control.(/) Although the Russians are no doubt genuinely alarmed at any prospectof nuclear weapons in German hands and although the creation of theforce will give the Russians the chance to argue that the West isinsincere in its pursuit of a detente, the Soviet Government must havealready discounted the prospects of the force in deciding to sign the test Ban Treaty and pursue East-West talks on other subjects. TheSoviet Union is driven by other compulsions towards a detente.Moreover the Americans evidently intend to work for both the detenteand the M.L.F. at the same time.Courses open to us7.   The following approaches are open to us:(a) We could make it clear that we are fundamentally opposed to the M.L.F.and will have nothing to do with it.(b) We could, while not opposing the force, continue to refrain from declaringour attitude to it or our intentions with regard to subscription.(c) We could say that we support the concept of the M.L.F., but in view ofother commitments cannot ourselves subscribe any significant moneyto it, although we should be prepared to offer certain facilities if theforce was created.(d) We could openly propose an alternative solution which could eithercomprise political measures only or could involve the formation of anew NATO nuclear force of some kind.(e) We could agree to take part in the work of the two preparatory groupsnow being established.8. If we were publicly to reject participation now, we should presumablyhave to justify this on the grounds that the force was not a military necessity,that it would impose a serious financial burden and that there was not enoughsupport for it in Parliament or in public opinion in this country. We could notargue that the force was not a workable proposition; as the Minister of defence said in the House of Commons on 3rd July &quot; such a force could be made to work.A command and control system could be devised. Our reservations or our doubts about it are not concerned with whether it could be done, but whether it shouldbe done, and whether it would add anything important to existing Westerndefences.&quot; In any event any public announcement now that we would in no circumstances join the multilateral force would be bound to antagonise the americans and the Germans, who see the force as a contribution to a solution tothe nuclear problems of the Atlantic Alliance but also in a large measure as atouchstone of our attitude to European political and military co-operation in contrast to that of General de Gaulle. We cannot exclude the possibility that a hostile attitude on our part to the M.L.F. might prejudice the supply of Polarismissiles to us under the Nassau Agreement. In general, too, if our attitude isnegative, we may find the United States increasingly reluctant to continue torecognise our special bilateral relations with them about consultation on the useof nuclear weapons.9. If we were to let the force go forward without declaring our attitude, weshould at least be able to see the eventual shape of the force before committing ourselves. On the other hand, we should no doubt be exposed to continual pressure from the Americans and their associates in the matter to co-operate with them andwe should be open to the accusation that we were dissociating ourselves from an enterprise of great importance to the whole alliance. Moreover, we should excludeourselves from any possibility of influencing the shape of the force during itsformative stage.10. To support the force in principle, without offering any contribution except possibly facilities, would avoid any financial commitment but would not necessarilyqualify us to take part in the preparatory groups or thus to influence the ultimateshape and size of the force. The United States and Germany would continue to
press us to take part in a more meaningful way. We should also no doubt be criticised for taking an equivocal attitude, similar to our attitude to the common market before 1961.Other possible solutions11. This raises the question whether we should propose some alternativesolution. Broadly speaking, the possible alternatives fall into three categories:(a) a political solution;(b) a different military solution on a NATO basis;(c) a European solution.12. We have already considered the idea of a purely political solution: either the formation of a new NATO Nuclear Control Commission, or the use of existing machinery such as the NATO Nuclear Committee. There are theoretical objectionsto both these courses. The NATO Nuclear Control Commission would tend to divide the alliance into first-class and second-class members. Another cause ofdivision would be that France would certainly not take part. The NATO NuclearCommittee, on the other hand, is too large a body for the discussion of sensitivemilitary information. Nor would its members, who are in effect the North atlantic council sitting in restricted session, be equipped to discuss technical matters.The practical objection to both these possibilities, however, is that neither theUnited States nor Germany are prepared to consider an exclusively politicalsolution of this kind. They are convinced that some outward and visible sign of Germany&apos;s share in the nuclear arrangements of the alliance is essential.13. In any alternative proposals therefore we should have to go further and consider whether any other regrouping of NATO nuclear weapons, existing or projected, would be acceptable to us and also meet the requirements of theGerman problem. To meet the political requirements, any such proposals wouldhave to accept the principle of mixed-manning. This would mean also accepting the principle that all participants had a veto on the use of weapons concerned,i.e., we should retain a veto on the use of any forces, weapons or warheads whichwe contributed, but we should be unable to use them on our own authority alone,without the concurrence of the other participants. There are various possiblevariants:(a) seaborne (surface or submarine), airborne or land-based;(b) long-range (&quot;strategic &quot;) or shorter-range (&quot; tactical &quot;)- weapons;(c) an all-NATO or a European grouping.Seaborne14. The present United States proposal is for surface ships. Surface ships are cheaper and quicker to build and more readily adaptable to mixed-manningthan submarines. The United States Government also claim that surface ships could conceat themselves in European coastal waters which submarines could not enter. But surface ships are more vulnerable than submarines. If they were to appear on world trade routes they could be claimed to be provocative and giverise to legal and political difficulties. They would have to be specially built overand above existing defence budgets. A submarine fleet could be formed without additional cost if we and the United States offered existing or planned polaris submarines for mixed-manning. Any of our submarines so offered could of courseno longer be used independently by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in defence of&quot; supreme national interests&quot;, as agreed at Nassau. Moreover, the technical problems involved in the mixed-manning of submarines would clearly beformidable.Land-based15. Mr. McNamara has suggested to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atWashington that a deployment of the projected &quot; Missile X &quot; might be the cheapestand most effective way of responding to the demand for M.R.B.Ms. in Europe.Land-based missiles would be more accurate than missiles mounted on ships. Theycould be made mobile on railway trucks or lorries to escape pinpointing by theRussian counter-force missiles. They could be placed under custodial arrangements which would keep the trigger device separate from the missile; this would not ofcourse be possible in a seaborne force, where the missile and trigger would have to
be kept on the same vessel. On the other hand &quot; Missile X &quot; at present only exists as adrawing, although it could no doubt be developed quickly if necessary. Moreover,the deployment of long-range missiles on land and largely on German territory would be open to all sorts of risks; apart from the possibility of sabotage oraccidental explosion, it could be argued that it would be easier for the localauthorities if they wished to secure control of a land-based missile than of a mixed-manned ship or submarine.A irborne16. At this stage there can be little advantage in offering the V-bombers formixed-manning. Indeed, the opportunities for mixed-manning of any aircraft arevery limited. But the possibility exists of offering to assign the TSR-2 missile-carrying aircraft to an international force, to which other countries would assigncontemporary weapons (e.g., Pershing missiles) under some system of internationalpolitical control. This would be a different concept, as it would mean creating a force of shorter-range (&quot; tactical &quot;) weapons systems.A &quot; tactical M.L.F.&quot;17. This might appear less provocative than the present United states proposal. In the new NATO strategy which is being evolved a significant roleseems likely to be allotted to tactical nuclear weapons as the link betweenconventional forces and the strategic deterrent. A case can be made for groupingthese tactical weapons in some international formation under the direct controlof the Supreme Commander. This could be a mixed formation of land-basedand airborne weapons. The land-based missiles could be mixed-manned eitherindividually or on a unit basis. Individual aircraft however could not be mixed-manned, although there could well be mixed-manned units, including nationalsquadrons. Much would then depend on the system of political control over theGerman national squadrons. From the German point of view, however, the mainrequirement is for a card of entry to Western decisions about the use of the strategic nuclear deterrent itself. A system confined to tactical weapons might therefore be held not to meet this requirement.A European solution18. Any alternative proposal for a solution on these lines could be putforward on a European rather than a NATO basis. A European solution could take one of two basic forms :(a) it could be a grouping of the W.E.U. countries or of those european members of NATO who wanted to take part in a force of which theUnited States would not be members and over which they would haveno veto; or(b) it could be based upon an Anglo-French agreement, making use of theexisting nuclear forces of this country and France.(In either case the force could be armed either with M.R.B.Ms. with a &quot; strategic &quot;capability or with shorter-range &quot; tactical &quot; nuclear weapons.)19. Although the Germans have indicated that they would like to keep open the possibility of eventually removing the United States veto on the multilateral force, this does not mean that they want a separate European force. Indeed theyhave consistently made clear that one of their main objectives is to obtain a positionin an organisation of which the United States is also a member, so that they maybe associated with United States nuclear policy and will be able to bring their influence to bear. Moreover, they presumably hope that if they can persuade theUnited States to use weapons such as those in the multilateral force of which theyare both owners, it will follow that the United States will be prepared to use their main strategic deterrent also. This will give added security to Germany whichwould not be available under a purely European system. Moreover, if we were toenter into any European deterrent we should have to ensure that the new arrangements were consistent with our policy of non-dissemination and the united nations Irish Resolution; this would mean that we should have to prevent effective control passing into the hands of nations which are not now nuclear Powers. Wewould not agree to a majority vote. If the Americans were not present to exercise a veto, there would have to be an effective United Kingdom or, if France was amember, French veto. There seems no reason to think that the Germans or theother Europeans would be prepared to exchange a United States for a United
Kingdom veto. Moreover, from our own point of view it seems certain that any financial contribution which we might have to make to a European force wouldbe larger than our contribution to a multilateral force of which the United states were bearing 30 per cent of the financial burden.20. For similar reasons there is little prospect that the rest of Europe would want to throw, in their lot with a force based on the existing United Kingdom andFrench nuclear forces. Nor has there so far been any reason to think that general de Gaulle would make significant concessions to facilitate such an arrangement.His objective is a French national nuclear deterrent, round which he would liketo group a European political structure. He has given no indication that he v/ouldadmit the United Kingdom to that European grouping in return for assistancein the military nuclear field which might compromise his own nuclear independence.The United States Government could not be expected to approve or facilitate anyUnited Kingdom move to assist French national nuclear ambitions. Still less wouldthey be willing to use the United Kingdom as an agent for passing Americannuclear secrets to the French. If they were going to offer France any nuclearassistance the United States Government and still more the United States congress would undoubtedly expect to keep the transaction under their own control and ontheir own terms. In present circumstances, therefore, the most likely result of anyattempt by us to come to an arrangement on this matter with France would be thatthe Western Alliance would be divided into two camps, while the Americans led the Germans, Italians, Greeks, Turks and others into the multilateral force andwe found ourselves sharing the French position of isolation.21. With regard to all suggestions for an alternative to the multilateral force,I should emphasise that we are not being asked by the Americans, the Germans oranyone else to produce alternative suggestions. They regard themselves ascommitted to the multilateral force and if ever there was a time when they wereprepared to drop the multilateral force project in favour of some quite differentcourse that time is now past. It does not necessarily follow however that the M.L.F.project could not be considerably modified in the course of discussion.The preparatory groups22. This brings us to the question whether we should take part in the workof the two preparatory groups now to be established. I realise that participation bythis country in either or both of the groups may be regarded in some quarters as implying some commitment to take part in the eventual force. The Italians have,however, stipulated that no such commitment is implied on their part and we couldpresumably make the same stipulation. It is difficult to contemplate a steering groupmeeting in Paris and, though not formally linked with NATO, taking decisions about the management, ownership and military use of a new and powerful nuclear force, without this country as a prominent member of NATO having any say in its deliberations. It is clear that the Belgians, for example, have similar worries; they hope that the steering group could in effect be composed of the permanent representatives of the countries concerned on the NATO Council and that,although Belgium could not take part in the multilateral force if it meant an addition to her existing military budget, she could hope by taking part in thegroup&apos;s discussion to influence matters towards some better solution. This wouldseem to be in line with the suggestion which Dr. Schroeder threw out that weaponsfor the multilateral force might be found from existing resources, thus greatlyreducing the financial commitment involved. Both the United States and Germanyhave shown anxiety to bring us in and a corresponding willingness to make thisfinancially easy for us. I doubt whether we could expect to limit our contributionto base facilities alone; but the provision of some warheads and a tokencontribution of manpower might well be more acceptable. The provision ofwarheads might also help to rebut any accusations that the United States were primarily interested in selling their own equipment to the Europeans at a high price.Conclusions23. My conclusion from the above arguments is that while there are serious objections to the multilateral force project as at present put forward, there areobjections to all the possible alternatives; there is no wholly satisfactory course forus to follow and we must be prepared to accept risks of one sort or another. In anycase there is no evidence that the protagonists of the M.L.F. are prepared to acceptalternative proposals at the cost of abandoning the M.L.F. now.

24. In my view, we cannot take an entirely negative attitude to the multilateral force. We cannot prevent it coming into existence. Unless we take part from the start we may be unable to influence the shape which it assumes. If it comes into being as a going concern we may later want to join and have to accept theterms on which membership is offered. We do not want to repeat the history of ourrelations with the Common Market. The best hope of influencing the developmentof the force, and avoiding the political, military and financial risks which mightattend its development along the wrong lines, is to take part in the two groups which now seem about to be established.25. An immediate decision is required on attendance at these talks. this can only be taken if we are clear on the objectives which we want to achieve. i suggest that our objectives should be:(a) Any force which comes into being should be effectively subject to a veto onits use by the existing nuclear Powers (i.e., the United States and, if weare in it, the United Kingdom), even though it may also be subject to have to by other participants.(b) If, as seems likely, this means that the decision to use the force would haveto be unanimous, it should also be provided from the start that any decision to depart from this unanimity rule should also be unanimous(i.e., if we were in, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would have to concur init).\c) Whatever force may eventually be formed should be assigned to NATOand could only be withdrawn for use outside NATO on the unanimous agreement of the participating Governments.(d) No individual nuclear weapons should be exclusively under the control of germans.(e) The weapons used should as far as possible be found from existing orplanned weapons systems (i.e., we should, if we took part in the talks,be able to propose the incorporation of tactical nuclear weapons ornuclear submarines if we wanted to do so).(/) If possible there should initially be a pilot project, to test the effectiveness of mixed-manning in practice and the participants should agree not togo further unless the pilot project proved effective.(g) Since we already have heavy defence commitments and since the requirement for the M.L.F. is political rather than military, in viewof the number of nuclear weapons already at the disposal of the West,we should aim to keep any financial commitment by this country tothe absolute minimum. It is impossible at this stage to fix a figure,until we know more of the course of the talks. Much will depend onthe ultimate shape and size of the force, the nature of the contribution which we should be required to make and receipts which we mightbe able to offset (e.g., by the provision of facilities in this country).26. We cannot expect to achieve these objectives unless we take part in theforthcoming talks. I hope therefore that my colleagues will agree that I should inform the United States Government that we are ready to take part in the workof both groups, on the express understanding that we are not by this committed to eventual participation in a multilateral force. I should also propose to inform theUnited States Government and other interested Governments of the objectives which we hope to achieve on the lines of paragraph 25 above. In this way I should hope that like-minded Governments such as those of Belgium and the Netherlandswould also agree to take part in the groups and give us support there. It may be,of course, that the United States Government will not welcome our participationon the terms I have outlined. In that case we should have to consider the questionfurther. But to my mind the important thing is that we should now put ourselvesinto a positive and constructive posture towards our allies over this project.
