SECRET *        2 01(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (63) 146 COPY NO. _J30th July T 1963CABINETPOLICY TOWARDS SOUTH africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations and Secretary of State for the colonies have asked all our High Commissioners in AfricanCommonwealth countries for their assessment of the likelihood of retaliation by those countries against British interests if we take aline on South Africa which offends them greatly during the forthcoming debate in the Security Council.    I attach at Annex a note whichsummarises their replies.2.      Their main conclusion is that a very high degree of emotionabout South Africa has been generated in Commonwealth african countries, particularly since the Addis Ababa Conference.    Thisemotion arises most acutely on the question of a total arms embargoagainst South Africa.    It is almost certain that if by ourselves we vetoa resolution on this issue there will be retaliation against us in Africa.3.      The form of such retaliation cannot be predicted accurately.Even in a country like Sierra Leone, where there is at present goodwill and friendship towards us, we should be faced with hostility andresentment.    Widespread demonstrations against Britain would belikely.    It is also possible that British businessmen and firmsoperating in African countries would be subject to harassment.    Inaddition, depending on the way things develop in the Security Council,some more drastic action is possible, such as expropriation ofbusiness interests and the termination of military co-operation.   Threatsto leave the Commonwealth would be likely, but probably would not becarried out.4.      The African countries of the Commonwealth could, if theychose, inflict much harm on our economic interests.    Our exportsto them are larger than to South Africa.    The income from ourinvestments in South Africa is less than that from the rest of thecontinent.    On the other hand, in seeking to hurt us the Africans wouldinflict much damage on their own economies, for a chain-reaction of retaliation would involve them in the loss of our market and our aid.They are therefore unlikely to apply economic sanctions wholeheartedlyagainst us if we refuse to modify our policy towards South Africa.   Butthey could, and probably would, take limited action which would be damaging to our economic interests.
secret 0 05,     In supplying arms to South Africa we distinguish between armsneeded for external defence and those suitable for internal repression.This distinction has in practice proved very difficult to draw, andcarries no conviction with the African countries.   If we persist in itand incur sole responsibility for foiling the demand for a total arms embargo, we shall incur the maximum odium in Africa.6.     Provided the Americans are with us, the risk even of votingagainst a mandatory resolution calling for a total arms embargo againstSouth Africa would be acceptable.    But if we cannot carry the Americanswith us and so find ourselves in isolation (or only in company with theFrench), I consider that, subject to the fulfilment of existing contracts,we should go no further than the Americans.7.     I accordingly recommend that our representative at the united nations should be instructed to go as far as but no further than theUnited States in voting for restrictions upon the supply of arms to south Africa.D.S.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.

SECRET209SUMMARY REPORTS FROM^BRITISH HIGH COMMISSlONERS^ABOUT&apos; LIKELY&quot; REACTfONS&quot;!^ ^fJKTRlls J?british.&apos; POLICY. TOViARDSHgOUTH&quot; AFRICA:High Commissioners were asked to provide an assessment, ofthe likelihood of retaliation by African commonwealth governments if we were to stand out, at the forthcomingSecurity Council debate, against either a total arms embargo on South Africa or a demand for economic sanctions-    and to distinguish between a situation in which we stood out on ourown and one in which we were supported by other countries.2.      Their replies show beyond doubt that the main danger ofsuch reprisals would arise if we opposed a total arms embargo on our own.3.      Although the form and intense.-fey of retaliatory measures would vary from country to country,  there is general agreement that there would, as a minimum, be demonstrations against british official persons and premises.      In most countries too,we could expect dramatic gestures intended to express thestrength of emotional feeling about British policy    in Ghana,for example, these might include the expttlsion of the BritishJoint Services Training Team,  thus removing a major element inGhana&apos;s Western orientation and depriving us of a market forBritish arms.      In all African Commonwealth countries we wouldhave to expect a general disposition to make things difficult for British business interests  (e.g., by refusal of entrypermits;    agitation against British goodsr    interference withthe operations of British Overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C. )).h.      Some distinction can be drawn between &quot;West and East Africa.In Uganda and Tanganyika attitudes are more emotional, andthere might be a greater disposition in these countries to takebrusque and ill-considered steps.      In Ghana, reprisals wouldbe likely to take the form of carefully calculated politicalgestures)    in Nigeria and Sierra Leone the risk of overtpolitical retaliation would probably be less.      In both East and west Africa, extremists might demand severance of theCommonwealth link, though Governments would be likely to bemore cautious.     Account must be taken of the possibility of achain reaction, moderate countries being influenced by action taken by the more radical governments - Ghana, Uganda and tanganyka,5.      Reactions to a British refusal to support economic sanctions would be likely to be more restrained.      In West Africa and tanganyka there is at present some willingness to acknowledgeour special difficulties over economic measures against SouthAfrica.      In general, African Commonwealth Governments wouldbe likely to consider the consequences before takingretaliatory action against British trade which would seriouslydamage their own economies and development prospects.6.      In most cases the risk of retaliation against us wouldprobably be much less if we and the Americans voted the same way.Commonwealth Relations Office,Downing Street, S,,W.1.30th July, 1 963
