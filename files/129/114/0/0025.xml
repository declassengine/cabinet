Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1963C (63) 125 Copy No.     &quot;jf Q15th July, 1963 - -CABINETFORECAST ESTIMATES 1964-65Memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general it is now possible to form a judgment on the prospects for Supply expenditurein 1964-65 based on the initial costings for the Defence Departments and the forecast Estimates for Civil Votes which have been prepared by Departments,and I think my colleagues should be made aware of it and of some of its implications.-2. In paragraph 7 of the paper C. (62) 206, which the Chancellor of theExchequer and 1 jointly circulated on 14th December, 1962, we said:&quot; The real difficulty is 1964-65. If our economic policy succeeds in 1963,there will be no question of refiatibhary action in 1964. If expenditure continuesto rise at this breakneck pace, we shall be faced with an utterly intractableBudget situation in that year.&quot;It is now clear that matters have developed in just this Way.3. On the basis of this material and in the light of the experience gained inrecent years, it appears that the Budget Estimates for 1964-65 will on the basis of present policies total about  6,725 million when they come to be presented anincrease of about  585 million (94- per cent) over the Budget Estimates for 1963-64.Of this increase,  164 million is Defence.4.   The forecast of  6,725 million has been calculated on the following basis:  millionForecasts as prepared by Departments.........      6,505Allowance for increases in rates of pay and prices ... 120Miscellaneous additional items of expenditure       ...        1006,7255. As in previous years, the forecast Civil Estimates Were made on the basisof rates of pay and prices used for the preparation of the 1963-64 Budget Estimates.Similarly, the Defence costings make no allowance for the results of trie review of forces&apos; pay which is due early next year. To allow for increases in pay and prices,an addition of some  120 million has been made to the forecasts in order to calculatethe figure at which the 1964-65 Budget Estimates are likely to be presented. Thisassumes that rates of civil pay in the public sector will rise no faster than theChancellor envisaged in his Budget speech, and that there will be only a minimalrise in prices.&apos;6. Experience shows that for a variety of reasons $he total &apos;of the forecastsmade in May-June of the Budget Estimates for the ensuing financial year tendsinvariably to under-estimate the provision required. In 1961 the under-estimate on2817
Civil Votes was  235 million in all (including the effect of an increase in rates of pay and prices): in 1962 it was  263 million. It therefore seems reasonable to adda further  100 million to the adjustment referred to in the preceding paragraph.7.   Budget Estimates for 1964-65 totalling  6,725 million compare with theprovision made in recent Budgets as follows:Per cent rise  million      over previous year1955-56......      ...     3,859 0-21956-57      ...      ...      ...      3,960 2-61957-58      .........      4,070 2-81958-59     .........      4,259 4-61959-60     .........      4,490 5-51960-61      .........      4,907 7-21961-62     .........      5,187 5-71962-63.........      5,612 8-21963-64     .........      6,139 9-41964-65     .........      6,725 9-58. The Budget Estimates for 1963-64 compared with those for the previous year represented the largest increase since the Korean war. As will be seen, it nowlooks as if the Budget Estimates for 1964-65 will at least equal this exceptionallyfast rate of growth, if not actually exceed it.9. Other indications in the field of public expenditure confirm this picture.Despite the very large increase this year, which we were able to justify, onreflationary grounds, Departmental proposals for public service investment (only part of which falls on Votes) imply a further substantial rise in 1964-65. I shallshortly be circulating a paper to the Economic Policy Committee seeking decisions on the level of investment expenditure in that year. Meanwhile, this year&apos;s survey of public expenditure down to 1967-68 reveals that the momentum is likely tocontinue as far ahead as can sensibly be forecast.10. The immediate question before us is whether a further increase of 9^ percent in the Estimates next year is acceptable on either economic or political grounds.This year we were able to justify an increase of over 9 per cent by reference to theneed to stimulate the economy in the exceptional circumstances which existed atthe beginning of 1963. It is virtually certain that a further stimulus of this magnitudewill not be needed on economic grounds in 1964. If in the event we allow another9 per cent rise, this is likely at best to mean a neutral Budget with no room for taxreductions; and if the economy recovers fast in the next few months, it might evenbecome necessary to raise taxes. Politically many of our supporters have even thisyear shown some apprehension about the rise in expenditure. We have held thison the reflationary argument. This argument does not look like being availablenext year, and the fact that the trend towards taking a smaller share of G.N.P. for public expenditure which marked the earlier years of Conservative Governments,had now been sharply reversed, would become only too clear.11. In short, we have reached another turning point. In the last twelve months,we have been rapidly expanding public expenditure. With the economy on the move again, we cannot continue this approach, and we are bound once more to slow down. Otherwise, we shall be in trouble next April.12. It is a question of major policy which confronts us. If my colleagues feelthat an increase of anything like the order indicated above in next year&apos;s expenditure is not tolerable, then it will be necessary to consider major changes of policy.13. On the assumption that for all its disadvantages, my colleagues decidedas a matter of policy to face something of this order, but not to allow expenditure to get out of hand and early increases in taxation become inevitable, the following action will be required:(a) We must arrive at clear-cut decisions as to priorities. Firstly as betweenDefence and Social Services&apos; expenditure, since these are both thelargest and the most directly affected by decisions of policy. Secondlyas to priorities between Social Services. In the past we generally gave
Treasury Chambers,Great George Street, S.W.1.12th July, 1963.one service, e.g., housing in the early &apos;fifties, and education more recently, priority in expenditure over the years. But these priorities arenow blurred.(b) Achieve such individual savings as are possible, e.g., school meals.(c) Not accept new commitments, unless we are prepared to reduce others tomake room for them.14. I do not ask for detailed decisions now. But I do ask my colleagues torecognise that constraint of the growth of the Estimates and public service investment for 1964-65 is a major objective of Government policy; that we must do all that we can in the next six months to make it effective; and that we mustbring to an end the atmosphere of fairly easy treatment of expenditure which hasprevailed during the last year.J.
