Printed for the Cabinet: October 1963C. (63) 185 Copy No.    6 417th October, 1963CABINETFOREIGN OFFICE ACCOMMODATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at their meeting on 11th July (C.C. (63) 45th Meeting, Minute 2), the cabinet decided that the present Foreign Office building should be demolished and a newone constructed on the site. The programme is at present governed by the move ofthe Home Office to new accommodation in 1969. By that time it is envisaged thatthe Foreign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office should be moved intothe present Admiralty building while the work of demolition and rebuilding takes place. The completion date is estimated to be about 1972-73. Examination of thequestion of providing good temporary accommodation for the Foreign Office andthe Commonwealth Relations Office for the next 10 years has failed so far toproduce any alternative to the above plan; it is therefore proposed to carry out an urgent short-term programme of redecoration and part refurnishing of theexisting Foreign Office building to tide over the next five or six years.2. The Cabinet ruled that the decision to rebuild should not be announced inany form at this stage. In the meantime there has been growing unrest, and evenindignation, among the Staff Side of the Foreign Office to whom it has not beenpossible to give any assurance that their disgraceful living conditions will be improved in the foreseeable future. There have also been leakages in the Press about our decision, which are likely to spread. The Ministry of Public Building and Workshas had to state officially that the plan for converting the existing Foreign office has been dropped.3. I do not consider that we can maintain silence any longer without seriouslyprejudicing the morale of the Foreign Office staff. In any event leakages will makea statement essential in the near future.4. In my view there are strong arguments in favour of disposing of this nowin considered terms, rather than being rushed into a hasty announcement, the timing of which might not lie in our own hands.5. I therefore recommend that my colleagues should authorise the issueforthwith of an announcement in the terms of the attached draft.H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,16th October, 1963.3311
DRAFT ANNOUNCEMENTi v, A decision has been taken by Her Majesty&apos;s Government to replace the presentBuilding in Whitehall housing the Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Officeand Home Office. For many years it has been apparent that this building, whichwas constructed in 1868, is no longer capable of providing satisfactory working conditions or adequate accommodation for these major Departments.Various proposals have been very fully considered: for a move to other sites,for the complete renovation and modernisation of the existing building, and for rebuilding on the present site. It has become apparent, after detailed study, that anyattempt to retain the present building even with such modernisation as would bepossible structurally, would be uneconomic and would fail to provide accommodation suitable for present-day conditions, let alone for future requirements.It has therefore been agreed that the Home Office should move into other accommodation and that the existing building should then be demolished and anentirely new building to house the whole of the staffs of the Foreign Office and theCommonwealth Relations Office (at present scattered through many separatebuildings) be erected on its site.Temporary accommodation will be found for the Foreign Office and theCommonwealth Relations Office pending the completion of the new building.An announcement concerning the design of the new building will be made indue course.
