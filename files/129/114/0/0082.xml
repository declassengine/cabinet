Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1963C. (63) 182 Copy No.     ^ ^15th October, 1963CABINETREGIONAL PLANNINGMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council and Minister for science and the Minister for Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh affairs when Parliament reassembles White Papers will be presented setting out theGovernments plans for Central Scotland and the North-east.2. These will raise the whole question of the Governmenfs intentions forfurther plans for regional development; and also of the machinery for dealingwith such planning.Further regional planning3. It is proposed that The Queen&apos;s Speech should say, following the promise of the plans for Central Scotland and the North-east, that further plans will beproduced. There will then be an opportunity to develop this in the Debate on the address.4. The Minister of Housing and Local Government has already announcedthat work is going forward on plans for the South-east (now well advanced); andfor the North-west and the Midlands. In all three regions a great deal more land has to be brought forward for development over the next 20 years; and the local planning authorities need to be given the framework to which to work. The PrimeMinister has announced that plans will be produced for Wales.5. The Government have not yet however except in the context of central scotland and the North-east developed the theme of regional planning as themeans of stimulating and directing growth.6. We suggest that the Government should now declare that they intend toproduce and carry through regional plans as and where they are needed; and thatthey see in this an important contribution to stimulus of the economy. The objectwill be to foresee, as far as possible, both the employment trends and the probablegrowth or decline of population; and to plan for new growth where slack existsor is threatened, to ensure a sufficiency of land for development, and to disperseemployment and population from the congested and overgrown conurbations.7. One danger in this is that every part of the country will want to beincluded in a regional plan. This must be resisted at any rate for the present; partly because the result might be too much competition for public investment, andpartly because the Government machine could not do it all at once. We shouldnot, for the time being, attempt more than has already been started; though it maybe difficult to resist Devon and Cornwall, who are already asking for a regionalplan.Machinery of government. The problem here concerns England and Wales. In Scotland responsibilityfor taking the lead in regional planning and development falls naturally to theSecretary of State and his Development Department. But in England and wales the position is less clear, as is evidenced by the appointment of the Lord Presidentas the Minister with special responsibilities for the North-east when a plan for that region had to be produced.3298
9. The preparation and implementing of a regional plan calls for a concertedeffort by a number of Departments over a considerable period. The impetus whichthe plan is intended to give to a solution to the problems of the region can onlybe satisfactorily maintained if one Minister is responsible for co-ordinating theefforts of these&apos;Departments. We consider that this responsibility must lie with theMinister of Housing and Local Government, because of his responsibility both forland planning and for many of the environmental services water, sewerage,housing, urban re-development. This view is shared, we understand, by the other ministers concerned in particular the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Presidentof the Board of Trade, the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Transport. the seministers would of course retain their own responsibilities for their own parts ofeach regional plan.10. If this is accepted, the Minister of Housing and Local Government shouldtake over responsibility for seeing through the plan for the North-east as soon asit is published; though it would be convenient that the Lord President should retain his special responsibilities until the end of the year in order to join insupervising the transition to the more permanent arrangements and to ensure that&apos;the impetus which he has given to a practical solution of the problems of theNorth-east will continue.Regional offices11. Regional planning and development will involve a concerted effort by several Departments. Inter-departmental groups for the regions for which plans are being produced already exist or are being formed. In Whitehall, the population and Employment (Official) Committee reviews the plans as they come forward,and considers any general questions arising, submitting the plans or any issues ofpolicy to the Economic Policy Committee. But to the public what is important isthat the Government should be seen to be working in the regions and to be inclose touch with local opinion and with the local authorities.12. This is particularly true in the two Northern regions, because of theirdistance from London, their economic difficulties and the weakness of many of the localauthorities. The Ministry of Housing and Local Government have just re-established a regional office in Newcastle; and it is agreed that the main staff of all theDepartments concerned with the regional plan shall be housed there under oneroof. The Ministry have also re-established an office in Manchester; and though atpresent that office is concentrating on increasing the rate of slum clearance, its workwill be expanded to take in regional planning and development when the plan forthe North-west is sufficiently advanced.13. In Wales the Ministry have an office responsible for the whole range oftheir work, and the other Departments concerned also have offices; so that machineryfor regional planning and development exists there.14. The question of regional offices in the rest of the country is more difficult.The Ministry of Housing and Local Government do not want, as yet, to re-establishregional offices anywhere else, partly because of the staffing problems involved in doing so, but also because they would prefer not to do so until the proper regionalpattern has been further studied. They have no immediate need for further regional offices. The whole of the South-east from the Wash to Southampton is dominated by dispersal from London and will therefore be handled there; regional planningproblems do not yet arise in any acute form in Yorkshire or the North Midlands;nor in the South-west, except possibly in Devon and Cornwall. Whether a regional planning office should be established in the Midlands is an open question; but itwould be difficult to put one there and ignore the other regions, and the ministry would hope to leave this for the time being.Announcement15. If all this is agreed, an announcement should be made either during the debate on the Address or when the plans for Central Scotland and the North-eastare presented. The general line should be that following up the very encouragingstart on these two regions, the Government have decided to go in for regional planning over a wide front, seeing in this an important method of stimulatingand directing growth; that a major plan for the South-east will be producedshortly providing for further large-scale dispersal from the conurbation; and that plans for the North-west, the Midlands and Wales will follow.
16. Consideration has been given to the machinery of government. a concerted effort will be needed by several Departments, and this will be providedby the formation of inter-departmental groups, assisted by research staff, to workon the plans under the chairmanship of the Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, whose responsibility for land planning and for many of theenvironmental services puts them at the centre of this work. One such group willwork in Newcastle to carry forward the plan evolved by the Lord President;another will be formed in Manchester when work on the North-west plan is furtheradvanced; and one is being formed now in Cardiff. Elsewhere the work will, for thetime being, be done in London; though those concerned will maintain close contact with the regions.17. The Minister of Housing and Local Government will, therefore, beresponsible for answering any general questions on regional planning anddevelopment, and on the progress of particular plans. But this will not affect the responsibilities of other Ministers for their own parts in the plans and in particularwill not affect the responsibility of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the general level of the economy, or of the President of the Board of Trade for the location of industry. The distribution of industry policy is crucial to the success of plans for regional development.18. What this means for the North-east is that the Minister of Housing andLocal Government will become responsible for seeing through the plan and for keeping it up-to-date; but the Lord President will retain his special responsibilities for the region until the end of the year, in order that he can help to supervise the transition to the more permanent arrangements and to ensure that the impetuswhich he has given to the plan will continue.11th October, 1963.HAILSHAM.K.
