i CONFIDENTIAL &apos;          1%(THIS l^UMSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (63) 179 COPY.NO. &quot;7th October, 1963CABINETCOMPENSATION FCR VICTIMS OF CRJMES^OF VIOLENCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentThere is continuing pressure for a scheme for the compensation of victims of crimes of violence.2.      My colleagues may recall that we considered this matter in1962 before a debate in the House of Lords on the Report of the working party on Compensation for Victims of Crimes of Violence, which was published in June, 1961 (C. C, (62) 72nd Conclusions, Minute 2).    we agreed to take the opportunity of the debate to draw attention to thedifficulties inherent in the schemes considered by the Working Party.3.       The &quot;Working party considered two types of scheme:-(a) A scheme broadly similar to the Industrial Injuries Scheme,by which weekly payments would be made to persons whosuffered injuries as a result of a criminal assault, and payments might also be made to the dependants of personskilled.(b) A &quot;court scheme&apos;, in which the victim of a crime of violence could make a claim against the Home Secretarysubstantially similar to the claim for damages which hecould, under the existing law, make against the aggressor.Entitlement to compensation, which would take the formof a lump sum, would be decided by the courts, unless asettlement were reached out of court.    The Home secretary would have the right to recover from the aggressor as muchas possible of any compensation awarded to the victim.4.       Virtually all the public comment since the Working Party&apos;sreport was published has been in favour of a State compensation scheme of some sort.    Various types of scheme have been advocated by outside bodies.    All resemble one or other of the two schemesconsidered by the Working Party - a Conservative Party PolicyCommittee in their published report favoured a court scheme.    Allpostulate a right to compensation, and all would require legislation.5.      However, in the debate in the H;.use of Lords last Decemberseveral speakers proposed that compensation should be payableex gratia, rather than as of right.    The feasibility of an ex gratiascheme was subsequently examined by officials, who, in an-1-
CONFIDENTIAL ..        *j ^ 0unpublished report, outlined an arrangement under which a body of trustees would be appointed by the Home Secretary, without thenecessity for legislation, and would be supplied with funds from whichthey would pay at discretion such sums as they thought appropriate tothose who had suffered serious injury from violent crime.      the trustees would act within general principles approved by Parliament,As, however, payments would be made as an act of grace and not as of right, there would be no appeals against the trustees&apos; decisions andthey would not be bound to give reasons for them.6.       Just before the recess I held a meeting of Ministers and officials, at which there was unanimity that the practical alternativeswere a court scheme (see paragraph 3(b) above) or an ex gratiascheme.     There was, however, divided opinion on the merits ofthese alternatives.    It seemed to me - and this is still my opinion that in the long run a court scheme would be the more satisfactory,for three main reasons:-(a) It would be difficult to satisfy Parliament and the publicwith an arrangement under which applicants had norights, and no reasons were given for decisions.(b) Under a court scheme, disputes would be resolved bythe judiciary, and the Home Secretary would not beanswerable for their decisions, whereas it would bedifficult, in such a potentially controversial field, fora Minister to disclaim responsibility to parliament for the decisions of trustees appointed by him.(c) Provision for recovery of compensation from the offender, such as would be a feature of a courtscheme, could not in my view be incorporated ina non-statutory ex gratia scheme.7.       The Lord Chancellor, on the other hand, strongly prefers an ex^ gratia scheme, particularly on the ground, as I understand it,that it would be wrong to adopt a course which, by recognising aright to claim compensation and putting the Home Secretary in theposition of a defendant to an action brought by the victim of a crime,would seem to imply that the State was in some way to be held responsible for the criminal act giving rise to the claim.8.       Memoranda by the Lord Chancellor and myself setting outthe arguments for and against a court scheme and an ex gratia scheme were put to the Home Affairs Committee on 4th October.    W.j were agreed that in view of the public and Parliamentary pressure therewas advantage in any course that enables us to act quickly;  and themajority thought that it would be best to avoid any scheme which byappearing to give a right to compensation might be represented,however mistakenly, as an admission of failure by the Governmentto protect the victims of crime.    Their view was that we should introduce a non-statutory ex gratia scheme as soon as possible next session, although it could be made clear to Parliament that thescheme was experimental and that, in the light of experience,further consideration could be given to instituting a permanent scheme by legislation.-2-
9.      The ex gratia scheme should, it was thought, be presented asfilling a gap in the social services, rather than conferring rights onvictims of crimej and from this point of view it was thought to be preferable that the scheme should be the general responsibility ofthe Minister of Pensions and National Insurance, who would appoint the tribunal which dealt with claims, than of the Home Secretary.10. The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance was not ableto be present at the meeting of the Home Affairs Committee, and itwill be necessary to give further consideration both to the part thathe might play in an ex gratia scheme and to many other aspects ofit. The Minister has informed me of objections that he sees to theproposal that he should be responsible for a scheme presented as a social service.    In particular:-(a) Presentation of the scheme as a social service implies that the victims of crime can be singled out from the victims of other misfortunes whose injuries andfinancial losses are the same and who may in somecases (e. g. persons injured in attempting to savelife) be even more deserving.    If the differentiationis not to be justified by some argument putting victims of crimes of violence in a special category the Ministerfeels that it will be difficult to resist demands for a consequent far-reaching extension of the social services.(b) If the scheme is to be conceived of as a social service,it is not easy to see on what basis the payments areto be made.    The Minister does not consider that theindustrial injuries scheme is an appropriate analogy,because that scheme is designed for employed persons and includes benefits (i. e. , for incapacity for work,unemployability and loss of earnings) which are appropriateonly for such persons, whereas many, if not most, ofthe victims of crime will be housewives, children, old people and others not normally in employment.    Theindustrial injuries scheme is a contributory scheme.Moreover some of those who have pressed for compensa-tion for the victims of crime (e. g. , the Bow Group andLord Longford&apos;s Committee) have expressed the viewthat industrial injuries benefits would be insufficient.Whatever basis is chosen would be likely to have its effects on the payments for which the Minister is responsible to a much greater extent than if the schemewas run by some other Department and not expressly asa social service.    These effects in the long run couldbe extremely expensive.(c) The Minister also feels that the machinery of his department and the independent tribunals who determineclaims for benefits are unsuited for the kind of investigations and decisions which would be involvedin this field.    He has already indicated that he would,of course, be willing for the Ministry&apos;s medicalfacilities to be used for the purposes of an ex gratia-3-
scheme, but beyond this he does not feel that his department could accept anything more than very limited responsibility, i. e. , the investigations of claims and the presentation of cases at hearingswould have to be undertaken by staff responsible to the trustees and not to Ministers.11.      If however the Cabinet endorse the view expressed by themajority of the Home Affairs Committee, that a non-statutoryex gratia scheme should be introduced next session, I will examine these questions as rapidly as possible with the Minister and myother colleagues concerned with a view to seeking their approval to proposals which would be put before the House as soon as possiblein the new session precise,    I would then propose to say, in replying to a motion at the Conservative Party Conference, which calls on theGovernment to introduce legislation for the payment&quot; of compensation,that the Government intended to make a statement to Parliamentearly in the new session.Summary12.      I ask my colleagues to consider:-(a) whether we should now decide in principle tointroduce as an experiment a non-statutoryex gratia scheme for compensation of victims of crimes of violence (rather than a &quot;courtscheme&quot; such as I would prefer), and make an early announcement in Parliament of our intention to do so;(b) on what lines I should be authorised to reply atthe Conservative Party Conference.H.B.Home Office, S.
