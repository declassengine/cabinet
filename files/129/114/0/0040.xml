Printed for the Cabinet. July 1963C. (63) 1.40 Copy No.     g g29th July, 1963CABINETLONG-TERM GROWTH OF PUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general  undertook (C.C. (63) 47th Conclusions, Item 8) to circulate a memorandumon the long-term growth of public expenditure. This follows from our discussionlast May of C. (63) 72. The Cabinet then agreed that limits should be established to the rates of growth of certain major blocks of expenditure; and that the actuallimits should be settled in the light of this year&apos;s Public Expenditure Survey. Thisis now available, costing expenditure to 1967-68 on the basis of present policies,and I am circulating it herewith.2. The picture presented is exactly the same as that on the ForecastEstimates for 1964-65 (C. (63) 125); and that on public service investment for1964-65, which has recently been discussed in the Economic Policy Committee;and the increasingly acute problem for local rates. These are all short-term partsof the whole long-term situation.3. In recent years we have become committed to policies, in defence, social services, subsidies, etc., which involve a faster growth of expenditure than anyconceivable sustained growth in our resources, the gross national product (G.N.P.).4. In 1958-59 public expenditure (excluding debt interest) was 36 per cent of G.N.P. Last year it was nearly 40 per cent. In 1967-68, on present policies,and assuming a sustained growth of 4 per cent per annum in G.N.P. (twice as fast as ever before in this century), it will be 41-1 Per cent. One would expect the proportion to turn out greater, for the Departments&apos; long-term expenditure forecasts are always much under-estimated.Rising Public Share of G.N.P.5. Does this trend matter? In the 1950s we scored heavily in lower taxes and economic buoyancy by increasing the private sector&apos;s share. The reversal ofthis trend since 1959 is raising the public sector&apos;s share to what it was 12 years ago.6. First, the Budgetary effect. We have lately both increased expenditure and reduced taxes (while pushing up local rates and national insurance contributions). This was possible only because of slack and stagnation. Once we get back to full employment, the expenditure trend will lead to very difficultBudgets.7. Second, the public expenditure trend will certainly imply a slower growth of private consumption than in recent years. This may not be a bad thing, for public services may rank higher. But if this is our view we must face it and be willing to enforce it by taxation.8. Third, and most important, the progressive reduction in the private sector&apos;s share of G.N.P. threatens to undermine our economic strength. Afterthe public expenditure claims have been met, too few resources will be left to sustain our industrial power and foreign trade, which is the indispensable basisof defence, foreign policy, social services and everything else.9. There is no crucial ratio of public expenditure to G.N.P. The trend is what counts. This trend has now been running for five years; and on present policy it will continue. The nation&apos;s economic performance has not been good inthese years.2899
New Expenditure Proposals10. I must mention five new major expenditure projects, of which only apart of one is included in the 1967-68 costings.11. Defence-The maintenance of our defence policies is increasingexpenditure much faster than had previous ;ously been envisaged. Our defence effort in. the Far East costs  300- 400 million a year, rising fast; apart from defenceaid for India and Malaysia. In addition, we are spending about half this on defence in the Middle East.12. Robbins Committee.-The re )rt in October will press for a greatacceleration of expenditure on higher education (already the fastest increasingpart of the Estimates). This implies further expansion of education at all levels.13. North-East and Central Scotland.-Om White Papers in October will certainly mean much more expenditure, in industrial inducements and publicservice investment.14. Crowther I Buchanan Report.-This will be published in November. Itis primarily a guide to future decades&apos; needs in urban roads and renewal; butit will create immediate pressure on the road programme.15. Wage-related Unemployment Benefit. We are starting (in this and inwidowhood) the process of enquiry which normally leads to large new spendingprogrammes.Priorities16. We cannot afford everything; and so we must have priorities. In the1950s we made room for growing social services by cutting defence; and within this we made room for education by cutting back housing, and by keeping downroads and health. This was how the priorities worked.17. I was asked by the Cabinet how to work priorities now. I envisage threedecisions.(i) How fast can we allow defence expenditure to rise? The faster it goes,the less for social services.(ii) Is the present balance between the civil public services socially and politically right? Do we give higher priority to education or to housing? And what is the relative priority of prisons and healthincluding the hospital service? These are for the Cabinet to decide.(hi) If new projects come forward, what shall be cut out to make room forthem or shall they be matched by extra taxation?18. The various services, from defence and overseas aid at the one end tofamily allowances and hospital beds at the other, are in a sense incommensurate,but they all call for economic resources manpower of various skills, materials,and savings. &quot; Priorities &quot; means which should grow fastest. If we say we cannotchoose, it means that we are actually choosing more taxes, lower private consumption, less private investment, less exports, slower growth.&quot; Blocks &quot; of Expenditure19. The essential decisions are long-term ones, for it is difficult substantially to affect public expenditure quickly. I propose that for each great &quot; block &quot; ofexpenditure (except for defence) we accept for planning purposes the rate of growth of expenditure from 1963-64 to 1967-68 that the Departments have themselvesindicated. These are set out in Annex A. For defence, I propose we take a rate whichkeeps the total within 7 per cent of G.N.P., and require defence policy to accommodate itself within this amount of resources.20. The &quot; blocks &quot; will cover roads, housing and environmental services(investment), education, health and welfare, police and prisons, benefits and assistance. They include capital and current, central and local the total claim on resources for these services, which represent about two-thirds of the total of public expenditure. There are other smaller items that can be developed in this way. Thereare other kinds of expenditures (notably agricultural support, local employmentgrants, etc.) which cannot be planned ahead; here it is important to get the rightpolicy.
New Commitments24. I was asked by the Cabinet to expand further my proposal on how to dealwith new commitments. For long-term commitments, the previous paragraph sets out my proposal. The Minister responsible will either find room in his own &quot; block &quot;,or will have to seek a deliberate Cabinet decision to adjust the growth rates of other&quot; blocks &quot; or abandon the proposal altogether.25. This is for when the &quot; blocks &quot; are in full working order. In the context of1964-65 Estimates, before the &quot;block&quot; system is working, I propose that mycolleagues should, as far as they possibly can, absorb the desired new project by adjusting something else provided for in their forecast Estimates. If they cannot do this, we shall have to consider the project in relation to the whole 1964-65 Estimatespicture and its implications. The essential one of the main points of the PlowdenReport is that major decisions to increase expenditure should never be takenexcept in this background.Conclusions26.   I therefore recommend as follows that (a) A system of &quot; blocks &quot; of the major elements of public expenditure shouldbe set up, and a permitted rate of growth laid down for each for long-term planning purposes. Any proposal for significant additional expenditure must either be absorbed in the relevant &quot; block &quot; or mustbe submitted to Cabinet for decision, which either rejects the proposalor reduces another &quot; block &quot; or authorises an increase in the aggregate,accepting consequences on the other side of the balance-sheet.(b) The growth rate for defence would be fixed as keeping the total within7 per cent of G.N.P.; and for the other blocks in accordance with thegrowth rates indicated in Annex A.(c) Expenditures outside the &quot; blocks &quot; will be treated as far as possible on thesame lines, i.e., decision by the Cabinet, with the full picture ofexpenditure and resources provided, if it is impossible for the Ministerto make corresponding reductions elsewhere.(d) Officials to be instructed to divide the &quot; block &quot; growth rates between theDepartments whose expenditure (capital and current) is included withinthe same &quot; block &quot;.(e) Within these aggregates of all kinds of public expenditure, proposals for additional 1964-65 Estimates and increased public service investment should be handled analogously, with submission to Cabinet in order todecide whether and how much room should be made for the additional expenditure proposed.J. B.-C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,26th July, 1963.21. If for planning purposes we take the Departments&apos; figures, we shall bedeveloping public services on a scale that involves a continuing increase in public expenditure in relation to G.N.P. This is a highly expansive pattern of public expenditure. We must face the fact that higher rates of taxation are implicit in it.22. Nevertheless, I recommend my colleagues to accept these growth rates for planning purposes. Within each &quot; block &quot; they will then be broken down intoDepartmental limits (capital and current), against which the growth of expenditurecan be judged, due consideration being given to changes in the value of money.23. Of course there will be new proposals. When these come, the minister should normally accommodate them within his &quot; block &quot; by adjusting something of lower priority. In some cases, the Minister will be unable to do this. The Cabinet will then decide whether the proposal should be accepted and, if so, whether theMinisters &quot; block &quot; should be widened, and some other &quot; block &quot; reduced to make room; or whether the aggregate should be increased. When such issues are taken to cabinet, I shall always submit particulars of the aggregate, thus enabling mycolleagues, if they wish, to adjust some other expenditure correspondingly.

The Defence Departments&apos; costings figure for 1967-68 is  2,105 million at Survey 1963 prices (this figure is believed to be too low by  35-50 million). This implies an annual rate of growth in real terms of 3 - 4 per cent and if, as recommended in this paper, defence expenditure at this level were to be kept within 7 per cent of G.N.P., there would have to be a rise in G.N.P. ofat least 4-5 per cent a year. If G.N.P. rose at 3 per cent a year, an increase in defence expenditureof about 2 per cent a year at constant prices would keep the total within 7 per cent of G.N.P.; if G.N.P.rose at 4 per cent, the permissible rate would be nearer 3 per cent.(b) Roads. All capital and current expenditure, including local authority expenditure onunclassified roads, street lighting, etc.(c) Housing and Environmental Services. Investment expenditure only, on housing, water and sewerage, and local government general investment.(d) Education. All expenditure (capital and current) by local authorities, the two EducationDepartments and the University Grants Committee, including awards to students, but excluding the cost of school meals.(e) Health and Welfare.

All capital and current expenditure of the Departments concerned andthe local authorities.(g) Benefits and Assistance. National insurance and industrial injuries benefits, war pensionsand national assistance, but excluding family allowances. The 1967-68 figure represents estimated expenditure on the assumption that rates of benefit increase in line with a rate of growth of real earnings per head of 2-9 per cent a year.

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1967-68Introduction1. This is the third annual report on public expenditure. O It sets out whatpublic expenditure is likely to be in 1967-68 on the basis of present policies and programmes, so that the aggregate of expenditure can be seen in relation toprospective resources. It deals with public expenditure in its widest sense, includingcentral and local government current and capital expenditure, investment of nationalised industries and the outgoings of the National Insurance Funds, but excluding debt interest.2. The report is agreed by the Public Expenditure Survey Committee asgiving as realistic a costing as possible of present policies and programmes. It is accepted however that the inclusion in this report of forecast expenditure figuresdoes not of itself commit either the Treasury or Departments to those figures.3. In some fields (e.g., education, health, roads, defence) Departments havebeen able to make projections of expenditure on the basis of specified policies and programmes. Although programmes are not necessarily firmly agreed withinthe Government there is no reason to suppose that the figures contain any marginwhich would allow them to be painlessly reduced later; indeed experience isthe opposite and new demands not allowed for are bound to arise in a five-year period.4. There are other items of expenditure where projections of this kind arenot possible. Here predictions have been made on the basis of past trends or by such other means as seemed most appropriate.5. Purchases of goods and services are expressed in terms of constant prices.Figures for current expenditure are on the same basis as the 1963-64 budget estimates; figures for investment expenditure are at March 1963 prices. Thefigures for benefits allow for rates of benefit increasing in line with a rate of growth of real earnings per head of 2-9 per cent per annum. Such payments asgrants and loans to industry, subsidies and overseas aid are money figures, butgenerally related to current levels of prices rather than to anticipated futureprices. These bases of the figures are referred to as &quot; Survey 1963 pricesPublic Expenditure in 1967-686. The results of the costing are shown in considerable detail in the appendix to this report. It will be seen that the total for 1967-68 at Survey 1963 prices is 12,731 million, including  300 million for contingencies (see paragraph 51 ofthe Appendix). This is an increase of  1,828 million or 16-7 per cent above thefigure for 1963-64.7. Ministers recently agreed (C.C. (63) 28th Conclusions, Item 5) that in establishing new arrangements for the long-term control of public expenditurespecial attention should be paid to certain main blocks of expenditure. Thefollowing table shows how the blocks of expenditure, as defined for Ministers&apos;discussion, now appear on the basis of the figures in this report.  million				Percentage	1962-63	1963-64	1967-68	per annum	actual	survey,	prices	increase	prices	1963		1963-64 to				1967-68Defence       .........	1,775	1,838	2,105*	3-4Roads         .........      ......	320	360	465	6-housing and environmental services (invest-				ment only)t        ............	469	555	694	5-7Education     ...............	1,154	1,251	1,571	5-health and welfare............	972	1,019	1,160	3-3Police and prisons......      ......	184	201	231	3-5Benefits and assistance       ......	1,512	1,746	2,058	4-2Total        ............	6,386	6,970	8,284	4-other expenditure............	3,488	3,933	4,447	3-grand total        .........	9,874	10,903	12,731	4-0* Defence Budget costings adjusted to Survey, 1963 prices.t Housing, water and sewerage and local government general only.(!)The two previous reports were: Public Expenditure and Resources, 1961-62 to 1965-66;Public Expenditure to 1966-67.SECRET2841 a 2
Comparison with 1962 Survey8. A similar costing of public expenditure (down to 1966-67) was carriedout last year; and some of its findings can be usefully compared with those ofthe present survey. This year (as stated in paragraph 6 above) the costing impliesan increase in total public expenditure of 16-7 per cent (or 4 per cent per annum)in the four years 1963-64 to*1967-68; last year the increase was 15f per cent (or3-7 per cent per annum) for the four years 1962-63 to 1966-67. The differencebetween the outturn for 1962-63 and the estimated total for 1963-64 (on the same basis as regards prices and rates of benefit) is calculated at rather more than per cent.9. Calculations have been made of the difference between last year&apos;s total for 1966-67 and the total for 1966-67 implied in this year&apos;s costings, afteradjusting last year&apos;s figures for difference in the price basis and in the nates ofbenefit and assistance used. The difference is estimated at  715 million. A large part of this reflects the prospect of a striking increase in expenditure between1962-63 and 1963-64 (see paragraph 8 above). Of the total increase, some 295 million is in the nationalised industries investment and another  105 million in the field of public services investment. The rest is pretty widely spread. In theservices covered by the major blocks of expenditure listed in paragraph 7 above,the difference apart from the investment element is  100 million.10. By the nature of the calculation, the figure of  715 million above forthe difference between last year&apos;s and this year5s costings in respect of 1966-67excludes the substantial increase that has taken place in the real rates of national insurance benefits and assistance since last year, which increase is reflected inthis year&apos;s costings.Conclusion11. The costing suggests that public expenditure at Survey 1963 prices (as defined in paragraph 5 above), will grow from 1962-63 to 1967-68 at 4-6 percent per annum. Within the total, current expenditure on goods and services isexpected to increase at 3 - 6 per cent per annum and gross fixed capital formationat 7-7 per cent per annum. Assuming that the gross national product grows at per cent in real terms from the beginning of 1963 and that average moneyearnings (and rates of benefit and assistance) increase by 4^ per cent per annum,it is calculated that the Gross National Product in money terms will increase by5-9 per cent per annum. The costing suggests that in that event public expenditure (as here defined) would represent almost 41  per cent of the gross national Product in 1967-68, compared with just over 39^ per cent in 1962-63.

SUPPORT OF EXTERNAL POLICYDefence Budget1. The Defence programme costed in the 1963 Forward Look is based onthe same strategy as that costed in 1962, modified by some major decisions, forexample the substitution of Polaris for Skybolt. According to the defence departments&apos; costings it envisages a total expenditure of  2,120 million in1967-68, an increase of  282 million over the 1963-64 Budget Estimates and of 393 million over 1962-63 Budget Estimates. The costings have been examinedfor realism by the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence. There is agreement thatthe total of  2,120 million is understated at any rate by  35 million. The Treasurythink that  50 million would be nearer the mark.External Relations2. By far the largest item is overseas aid. The outturn in 1962-63 was ofthe order of  150 million, but for 1963-64 it is expected to rise to  180 million- 220 million, and Ministers have approved the recommendation of theCommittee on Development Policy and we should accept that a continuing increasein the size of our aid programme in the years ahead is inevitable, and that our policy should not be one of containing expenditure within a rigid ceiling, but rather of restraining the increase. What this increase will amount to over the nextfew years is impossible to say, since it will depend on such factors as the stateof our economy and the external situation. But for the purpose of this exerciseoutturn in 1963-64 has been taken to be  200 million, with annual increases of 10 million thereafter, giving a figure of  240 million for 1967-68.3. Expenditure on overseas information is currently operating within a ceiling of  23 - 6 million a year, and this figure has been adopted for 1967-68despite the possibility that some increase in the ceiling may have to becontemplated. The remaining items of administration, subscriptions and miscellaneous total  85-8 million for 1963-64. We estimate that in 1967-68 this figure will have risen to  100 million.ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL services table TPublic Expenditure on Economic and Environmental Services  million	1962-63	1963-64	1967-68Roads .....................	320	360	465Housing (investment only)*        .........	320	387	495Water and sewerage (investment only)    ......	102	111	130Local governmental general (investment only)   ...	47	57	69Other environmental and local services (investment			only)         .........      ...      ......	37	50	58Housing subsidies    ...............	184	207	192Environmental and local services (current)...	296	308	360Deduct excess of investment by housing associa-			tions over finance provided by the Exchequer ...	 	 	-55Total        ...............	1,306	1,480	1,714* Including investment by private housing societies.

Forecasts of investment expenditure on new construction and majorimprovement on major roads from 1963-64 onwards are based on proposals still under consideration in the Road Programme Committee. These forecaststherefore imply a revision of allocations agreed last year from the five-year programme, 1963-68, to take account of the following:(a) An allowance for price increases of 25 per cent of the allocations agreedlast year on payments arising out of new commitments during thefive-year period 1963-68, with smaller increases on payments arisingout of commitments undertaken during the two previous years. this involves a total addition of about  130 million to the programme forGreat Britain in the period 1963-64 to 1967-68, with increased payments of  8 million in 1963-64 rising to about  37 million in 1966-67, and thenfalling a little to about  32 million in 1967-68.(b) Additions for short and medium-term schemes approved in the winter of1962-63 as unemployment relief measures (just over  2 million in1963-64 and a balance of  3-2 million spread over the two following years 1964-66).(c) Provision   for   &quot; real&quot;   increases   in   agreed   programmes  of  nearly 20 million mainly for motorway construction in England and Wales( 17-7 million), additional work on the Forth Road Bridge and ClydeTunnels ( 2 million), and additional provision for preparatory work( 0-65 million) in Scotland.No provision has been made in these forecasts for additional investment in roadswhich the Departments have proposed as part of regional development plans forthe North-East and the Central Belt of Scotland.5. Forecasts for maintenance and minor improvements expenditure on majorroads are also based on proposals which have not yet been agreed (or evenconsidered) by the Road Programme Committee. A 10-year programme for trunk roads which provided for an average annual expenditure of  18*3 million wasagreed early in 1961, but the Departments are now asking for upward revisionto take account of price increases of the order of 10 per cent ( 1-8 million a year).In addition the Ministry of Transport want to make some changes in theprogramme in the light of a more thorough investigation into the state of the
trunk road network; these will add about  1-4 million a year (the long-term proposals agreed in 1961 were based on a sample). Other recurrent expenditureon maintenance of unclassified roads and street lighting is expected to rise from about  80 million in 1963-64 to  93 million by 1967-68. The Department arenot in a position to control this expenditure, which is determined by localauthorities; but traffic growth and higher prices indicate an upward trend.housing table IIIPublic Expenditure on Housing  million	1962-63	1963-64	1967-68Investment England and Wales     ............

An allowance is also made for houses to be provided by housing associationsunder the Housing Corporation proposed in the recent White Paper (Cmnd. 2050).These houses are expected to be financed as to about one-third of their capital cost by the Exchequer and as to about two-thirds by the building societies; it hasbeen agreed that, for control purposes, the whole of the investment by the housing associations should be taken as public investment, but the amount of non-Exchequerfinance is deducted before reaching a total for public expenditure (see paragraph 9(hi) below). In 1967-68 it is estimated that output will be some 15,000 houses a year,at a cost of  5,000 per house including land, which will add  75 million.7. In Scotland starts in the public sector (i.e., local authorities, Scottish special housing Association and new towns) are expected to rise from 24,000 in 1962-63to some 28,000 in 1967-68.8. Allowing for the extra cost arising from the increased number of houses to be built under the investment programme and assuming an increase in rentincome between 1962-63 and 1967-68 of 48 per cent, compared with an increasein gross expenditure of 35 per cent, the total housing subsidy bill for England andWales for 1967-68 is estimated to be  111 million, an increase of  13 million over1962-63. It is assumed that local authorities in England and Wales will continueto increase their rents at broadly the same pace as in the past. The subsidy bill forScotland in 1967-68 is expected to be  53 million, an increase of  16 million over1962-63. In the case of Scotland, it has been assumed that rents will continue tocover only one-third of the total cost of housing but this may well prove to bepessimistic.
9.   The other major items of expenditure on housing are:(i) Net advances by local authorities for house purchase: These are expectedto fall in England and Wales to  7 million in 1967-68 (because of a steady increase in the amount of repayments, despite an allowance fora further increase in gross advances the latter being put rather higherthan last year in the light of recent experience), and in Scotland to rise from  0-8 million to  1 million.(ii) Improvement grants by local authorities: Expenditure is expected to riseby 1967-68 to  22 million for England and Wales and to over  1 million for Scotland. The rise is more than estimated last year since an allowance is now included for the new policy contained in the White Paper on housing (Cmnd. 2050).(iii) Exchequer advances to Building Societies: and Housing Associations.The scheme for advances to Building Societies has now ended. as explained above (paragraph 6), the whole of the investment by private housing associations to be aided by the proposed new housing corporation, has been included under public investment; since theExchequer will cover roughly only a third of the cost of these housesan adjustment deducting the remainder is necessary before reaching thetotal of public expenditure.Environmental and Local services table IVPublic Expenditure on Environmental and Local Services  million	1962-63	1963-64	1967-68Investment						Water and sewerage			England and Wales			Water...............	36 1	36-7	44-1Sewerage      ............	54-9	61 1	70-3Scotland			Water...............	5-9	7-2	10-1Sewerage      ............	4-6	5-6	5-5Total      ............	101-5	110-6	1300Local Government general			England and Wales        .........	44-0	52-4	660Scotland    ...............	3-2	4-1	3-3Total      ............	47-2	56-5	69-other environmental and local services			England and Wales			Town and country planning	17-0	25-3	35-3New towns (excluding housing and			sewerage)   ............	7-5	10-6	7-5Coast protection      .........	1-3	1-3	i-3Arterial drainage     .........	81	8-9	9-7Scotland			Town and country planning	1-2	1-6	2-3New towns (excluding housing and			sewerage)   ............	1-9	2-2	2-2Total      ............	37-0	49-9	58-3Total investment      ...............	185-7	217 0	257-of which:			England and Wales............	168-9	196-3	234-scotland       ......      .........	16-8	20-7	23-current expenditure			Water and sewerage    ............	50	52	60Other environmental and local services	246	256	300Total current expenditure    ............	296	308	360of which:			England and Wales   ...	271	282	329Scotland	25	26	31Grand total    ..................	482	525	617of which:			England and Wales............	440	478	563Scotland       ...............	42	47	54
InvestmentWater10. The increase in investment expenditure from some  36 million in 1963-64to  44 million in 1967-68 in England and Wales reflects the need to provide fora constantly rising demand for water and is a continuation of the trend over thepast five years. Similar considerations apply to Scotland where expenditure isexpected to increase from  7 million in 1963-64 to  10 million in 1967-68.Sewerage11. Forecasts of expenditure on sewerage are based on an assumedcontinuance of the average trend of expenditure over the last five years. No increase is forecast for expenditure in Scotland.Local Government, General12. This head covers a miscellaneous group of services of local authorities;it includes the provision of sporting facilities. Expenditure on these services tends to rise steadily and there is a backlog of desirable, though not essential, work which local authorities have been prevented from carrying out because of earlierrestrictions on investment.Town and Country Planning13. The bulk of this item is for land acquisition for purposes of town centreredevelopment, town expansion and factory building by local authorities. the forecasts are based on the latest estimates of local authorities for purposes ofgeneral grant and on estimates of redevelopment work where there is mountingpressure for greater expenditure.New Towns14. Investment in new towns, other than on housing and sewerage, is made up largely of industrial building and commercial development: the remainderis mainly for road construction and the acquisition of land for buildings. the forecasts of investment include provision for Skelmersdale and for expansion ofthe designated area of Bracknell. They do not, however, make allowance for the designation of Redditch, Runcorn or any further new towns; nor for the furtherapproval of extensions to the designated areas of existing new towns.Current Expenditure15. Current expenditure on water and sewerage, local government general,town and country planning and other environmental and local services all taken together, is estimated to rise from  308 million in 1963-64 to  360 million in1967-68 at Survey 1963 prices a rate of increase of 3-9 per cent per annum for england and Wales, and 4-5 per cent per annum for Scotland (4 per cent forGreat Britain).OTHER ECONOMIC services table VPublic Expenditure on other Economic Services  million	1962-63	1963-64	1967-68Railways and waterways subsidies.........	154-5	145-9	115Other assistance to industry         .........	70-9	75-8	100Agricultural support.........	309-7	350	350Other services to agriculture, fisheries and forestry	41-7	40-9	42-5Expenditure other than investment         ......	576-8	612-6	607-5Investment 			Other assistance to industry   .........	30	39	35Other services to agriculture, etc.......	11	15	9Total...............	618	667	652
British Railways and Waterways Subsidies1.6. It is little easier than it was in 1962 to forecast progress towards eliminatingsubsidies to British Railways and Waterways. Improvement in the situation of theRailways Board depends very largely on the implementation of the Beechingproposals for the reshaping of the railway system. The Beeching report forecaststhat, if the whole plan is implemented with vigour, much (though not necessarilyall) of the deficit should be eliminated by 1970. On the information at present available the Ministry of Transport cannot make a firm forecast but they estimate that this could at best mean a reduction of the current deficit (estimated at  150million for the calendar year 1963) to  80 million (i.e., the operating deficit wouldbe eliminated, leaving the interest burden on the Board) in 1970. Such progressassumes, in so far as assumptions can be made at this stage, a steady realisation of economies and improvements under the plan, a continued rise of wages and ashare in the growth in overall demand for transport, regard being had at the sametime to a level of fares and charges compatible with the need to retain and increasetraffic suitable to rail. On this basis, and assuming an extension of legislative cover,the subsidy for 1967-68 would be  115 million.17. For British Waterways in their present circumstances the Ministry wouldcautiously assume a small improvement and estimate the subsidy as  1-5 million for 1967-68, but the sum is so small in comparison with the railways deficit that itseems unnecessary to show it separately. Accordingly, the figure of  115 million is included for railways and waterways taken together.Other Assistance to Industry18. Expenditure on assistance to specific industries, on the promotion of local employment, and on other economic services has been allowed for at  100 million in 1967-68, compared with  76 million in 1963-64. These forecasts represent thebest estimate that can be made at a time when a number of possible commitmentsare envisaged, but decisions have yet to be reached. Substantial additional expenditure may be required by regional plans, such as those for the North-east of England and for Central Scotland, and by future schemes of assistance to particular industries (e.g., ports and nuclear shipping). An allowance of  20-25million has been made for these and other contingencies. As last year, the forecastsassume some reduction in expenditure on the promotion of local employment, partly offset by increased assistance to the aircraft industry as development of thesupersonic airliner proceeds.Agricultural Support19. If present policies remained unchanged for the next five years, no decreasein the present level of agricultural support could be expected, rather the contrary.Present agricultural support policies are now being reviewed but it is impossible at this stage to estimate the effect on Exchequer expenditure of any changes whichmight result. For forecasting purposes, it has been assumed that the figures for1967-68 will be of the same order as the estimate of expenditure in 1963-64 as revised in the light of the 1963 annual review.Other Services to Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry20. Expenditure on other services to agriculture, fisheries and State forestryseems likely to rise from the current level of  41 million in 1963-64 to about 42-5 million in 1967-68.SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY services table VIPublic Expenditure on Social and Community Services  million	1962-63	1963-64	1967-68Education (including universities).........	1,154-6	1,250-7	1,570-6Health and welfare...............	971-9	1,019-3	1,160-2Police          ..................	160-8	173-8	1960Prisons         ..................	23-5	26-7	35-2Benefits and assistance       ............	1,511-8	1,746-4	2,058-3Children&apos;s services   ...............	274-6	289-2	313-8Total        ...............	4,097-2	4,506-1	5,334-1

Forecasts throughout the education field are made uncertain for two reasons. First, and most important, the Robbins Committee on Higher education has yet to report, and its report to be considered by the Government, so that the pace of educational expansion cannot be effectively assessed even within very widemargins. In particular, the figures for capital investment for 1967-68 must beregarded as token figures only; they have been inserted on the purely arithmeticalassumption that existing trends of capital expenditure continue in blocks directly affected by Robbins an assumption that is unreal but which cannot at present belimproved upon. The second point is that it is not yet known what effect theGovernments proposals for industrial training will have; they could lead toconsiderably increased expenditure in further education, both on capital and current account, from 1964-65 onwards.Primary and Secondary Schools22. The number of pupils is expected to rise by 7 per cent over the period,and it is estimated that the teacher force will increase by 11 per cent; the comparablefigure for the teacher force in Scotland is 5^ per cent. Non-teaching costs are shownas rising by 22 per cent in both England and Wales and Scotland.Teacher Training23. The figures reflect the announced expansion programmes both for Englandand Wales and for Scotland. Students are expected to increase in numbers by 55 percent in England and Wales and by 30 per cent in Scotland.
Colleges of Advanced Technology, etc.24. The increase in student numbers is estimated to be 50 per cent in C.A.Ts,while in the Central Institutions in Scotland it will be about 16 per cent. further expansion is envisaged but no firm plans have been made.Other Further Education25. Other further education continues to expand according to policies laiddown in the White Papers of 1956 and 1961, to which has now been added theWhite Paper on Industrial Training issued during the last year. In England andWales an increase is assumed of 46 per cent in teaching costs, and of 55 per centin non-teaching costs. The increase in Scotland is marginally lower.Universities26. The level of current expenditure for the universities up to 1966-67 is governed by the quinquennial settlement with the universities for 1962-67 togetherwith agreed adjustments for salary increases and other increased costs. Thenumber of university places in Great Britain as a whole is expected, according topresent plans, to reach a total of 150,000 by 1966-67; this represents an increaseof about 30 per cent over the whole period covered by this report. The estimatesshown for 1967-68 represent an extension of the trend established by the earlier years.Capital Expenditure27. The substantial increases in the number of pupils and students have their implications also for capital investment. Larger building programmes are assumednot only for universities and teacher training colleges, but also for further education institutions to meet the increasing demand for facilities at all levels, andfor primary and secondary schools as the result of rising birthrates, a continuingtrend towards a longer school life, and shifts of population to new housing. Thesehigher building programmes do not significantly affect current expenditure duringthe period under review, but they will be reflected in higher expenditures in thefuture.Health and WelfareTable VIIIPublic Expenditure on Health and Welfare  million	1962-63	1963	-64	1967-68Investment								Hospitals		52		76-9England and Wales        .........	37-7		5	Scotland    ...............	5-3	7	4	10-other central services and grants				England and Wales        .........

28. The Health Departments&apos; estimates up to 1965-66 for current expenditure are consistent with the policy of planning development in the health service as a whole at the rate of 2\ per cent a year, which was agreed in 1961 forthe next four years, although this policy has for some time imposed a speciallimitation on development, in the hospital service in particular. The forecast for1967-68, however, implies that the 2\ per cent rate will be exceeded after1965-66.29. The Ministry of Health figures for current expenditure on hospitals inEngland and Wales show a 2 per cent rate of increase from  500 million in1963-64 to  520 million in 1965-66 and then a 2\ per cent rate to  546 million in 1967-68. In Scotland the corresponding rates of increase are 2\ per cent and34- per cent respectively, from  64 million in 1963-64 to  67 million in 1965-66and  71-5 million in 1967-68. The difference in these rates of increase in the twocountries reflects the relatively greater emphasis in England and Wales on thedevelopment of &quot; community care &quot; in the form of local authority services outsidethe hospital service.30. Expenditure on the Executive Council Services, comprising the general medical, dental and ophthalmic services and the cost of prescriptions, is expectedto rise from  212 million in 1963-64 to  234 million in 1967-68 in England andWales and from  24 million in 1963-64 to  26 million in 1967-68 in Scotland, separately of increase of nearly 2\ per cent a year. This increase reflects increases in thenumber of doctors, the number and cost of prescriptions and the volume of dentaltreatment.31. A high rate of growth is forecast in current expenditure in England andWales on local authority health and welfare services. Expenditure on local health services is estimated to rise from  86 million in 1963-64 to  103 million in1967-68 and on local welfare services from some  32 million to nearly 42 million. (The comparable figures for Scotland are  7-3 million and 8-4 million for local health services and  2-4 million and  3-2 million for localwelfare services.) Long-term estimating for these services is complicated by thenumber and diversity of the authorities concerned, but the Ministry of Healthare satisfied that the forecasts are realistic and generally consistent with the 10-yearplans published in April 1963 (Cmnd. 1973). The Ministry see in this developmentof local community care a means of relieving the burden on the hospitals,particularly in the case of the old and the mentally ill.Police and PrisonsTable IXPublic Expenditure on Police and Prisons  million	1962-63     1	1963-64	1967-68Investment			England and Wales     ............	13-5	16-5	23-scotland..................	11	1-7	2 0Total        ...............	14-6	18-2	25-2Current expenditure			Police			England and Wales        .........	137-2	147-3	1640Scotland    ...............	14-6	15-6	170Prisons			England and Wales        .........	16-4	17-6	22-7Scotland    ...............	1-5	1-8	2-3Total...............	169-7	182-3	206-0of which:			England and Wales      ......	153-6	164-9	186-7Scotland............	16-1	17-4	19-3Grand total         ......	184-3	200-5	231 -2of which:			England and Wales      ......	167 1	181-4	209-scotland............	17-2	19 1	21-3
Police32. Expenditure, of which 50 per cent is paid by the Home Departments, isexpected to rise by about 13 per cent in the period. About 85 per cent of this expenditure is on pay, etc. (mostly for police, but also for civilian staffs). Strengthsand rates of pay are, therefore, the determining factors. The estimates are basedon the likely rate of recruitment at current rates of pay and it is thought that by1967-68 the total strength of the police in England and Wales might, on this basis,increase by about 8,500 to 87,500 and in Scotland by about 500 to 10,350.33. These estimates of strength are higher than the total establishments atpresent authorised, but it has been assumed that existing establishments will be substantially increased.Prisons34. The estimates provide for an increase in current expenditure of about29 per cent in the period from 1963-64 to 1967-68. mostly for additional staff for new establishments under the authorised building programme and to improveconditions in the prisons. It is impossible accurately to predict the future prisonpopulation but an increase of about 12 per cent over the period has been assumed.A bigger increase than this would reduce the improvement in prison conditionswhich could be achieved by the proposed increase in expenditure; a smaller increase would allow more rapid improvement, e.g., by reducing the number of prisonerssleeping three in a cell.35. Investment expenditure is estimated to grow from  7-3 million in1963-64 to about  10 million in 1967-68.Benefits and AssistanceTable XPublic Expenditure on Benefits and Assistance  million	1962-63	1963-64	1967-68National Insurance...............	1,210-0	1,423-0	1,709-0War pensions ...	101-8	1120	1140Non-contributary and old age pensions   ......	7-5	6-2	30National Assistance...............	192-5	205-2	232-3Total        ...............	1,511-8	1,746-4	2,058-3 national Insurance Benefits and War Pensions36. Apart from any further changes in rates of benefit, total expenditure on national Insurance benefits and war pensions would rise from  1,312 million in1962-63 to  1,633 million in 1967-68 mainly because of the higher rates of benefitintroduced this year and the continuing increase in the number of retirement pensioners. The Governmenfs pledge in the 1959 Election Manifesto, which hasbeen repeated from time to time, was &quot; to ensure that pensioners continue to share in the good things which a steadily expanding economy will bring &quot;. consistently with this pledge, policy has been that rates of benefit should rise broadly in line with earnings, although this years increase in rates went a good deal further than was needed to keep pace with the rise in real earnings (in cash terms the mainNational Insurance and war pensions rates were put up by some 17 per cent abovethe rates introduced in April 1961, compared with a rise of only some 7 per cent inmen&apos;s average industrial earnings since that date). For the purpose of estimatingexpenditure in 1967-68 on the basis of present policy, however, we have assumed that from 1963 rates of benefit are increased in real terms in line with an increaseof 2-9 per cent per annum in real wages per head. On this basis, the 1967-68 figurebecomes  1,823 million, an increase of  511 million in the five years from 1962-63.National Assistance37. It is estimated that the cost of national assistance (includingnon-contributory pensions) at current (1963) rates will increase from  200 million

The increase in current expenditure is in general related to the expectedrise in the number of school children using these services. The increase in capitalexpenditure is consistent with the trend in such expenditure on primary and secondary schools. The charge for school meals is under consideration by ministers at present.Child Care39. The forecasts reflect the established trend in the number of childrencommitted to the care of local authorities or sent to approved schools and remandhomes, and some expansion in child care work.Welfare Foods40. The increase in expenditure is related to the expected rise in the birthrate.Family Allowances41. It is estimated that the expenditure on family allowances will increase from  135-5 million in 1962-63 to  151 million in 1967-68 due to an expected increase in the number of eligible children.CIVIL PUBLIC INVESTMENT42.   Civil public investment is dealt with in two parts:(a) Investment by the nationalised industries and public corporations.(b) Public service investment, i.e., investment by the central Government andthe local authorities.This distinction follows from the development of the Government policy towardsthe nationalised industries as set out in the White Paper &quot;The Financial andEconomic Obligations of the Nationalised Industries &quot; (Cmnd 1337)in 1962-63 to  210 million in 1967-68. When allowance is made for the rates ofnational assistance to keep pace with National Insurance benefits rising with real earnings, the cost in 1967-68 becomes  235 million and this is the figure given asthe estimate of expenditure in that year.Children&apos;s services table XIPublic Expenditure on Children&apos;s Services
43. As our previous reports have emphasised there is a close link betweencapital and current expenditure. Accordingly, the major public service investment programmes have been considered along with the associated current expenditure in the preceding paragraphs. This section is concerned with general questions concerning investment and with describing the main features of nationalised industries&apos; investment.44. Departments&apos; estimates of investment expenditure are summarised in the table below. To permit direct comparison with the figures for 1963-64 and later years the estimated outturn for 1961-62 and 1962-63 has in each case been shownnot only at the actual prices of the time but also at March 1963 prices.

March 1963 prices.45. Total public investment is thus shown as rising by  825 million for march 1963 prices or 42 per cent in real terms over the five years 1962-63 to1967-68. The rate of increase falls off in the later years and the forecast for1966-67 is only marginally smaller than that for 1967-68. In practice it is unlikelythat this trend will be borne out by events since, for the reasons noted below,there will be a steady pressure to add to investment expenditure.Nationalised Industries and Public Corporations46. Investment by the nationalised industries and public corporations isshown as rising by  190 million between 1963-64 and 1966-67, followed by aslight decline of  10 million in the succeeding year. The forecasts prepared lastyear indicated a decline from 1964-65 onwards. The change in pattern is the resultof the upward revision of some of the major programmes (electricity and thePost Office) in conformity with the adoption of a national 4 per cent growthtarget. There is probably still some under-estimation of expenditure at the endof the period, because of the difficulty of predicting investment requirements sofar ahead.47. The figures for individual programmes are of course under consideration in the current investment review, and some figures are subject to furtheradjustment by the industries concerned. Apart from these uncertainties, whichmay alter individual figures in either direction, the general picture is of an increaseof the order of 7-8 per cent per annum in the period 1963-64 to 1965-66,compared with 3-4 per cent in the period 1960-61 to 1962-63.Public Service Investment48. Public service investment expenditure is expanding very rapidly. the forecast outturn for 1963-64 is about 15 per cent higher in real terms than theestimated outturn for 1962-63 and a further rise of more than 8 per cent in real terms is expected in 1964-65. The figures suggest some reduction in the rate of increase in the later years of the period, but this flattening out is unlikely tomaterialise as the full implications of current policies are worked out. Nor dothe figures make any allowance for additional expenditure flowing from new policies. Thus no account is taken, for example, of the likely consequences on education investment of the report of the Robbins Committee on Higher
Load on the Construction Industries49. About 50 per cent of civil public investment is on construction and thequestion arises whether the rates of increase in expenditure described above are within the capacity of the construction industries. A joint group of officials fromthe Treasury and Ministry of Public Building and Works have studied theprobable trends in demand and capacity for construction up to 1967-68. Theyestimate that in this period the total demand public and private for new construction will increase by 28 per cent and that capacity will rise by 27 per cent.This margin of excess demand is not sufficient to justify the slowing down ofpublic investment programmes on grounds of overload of the construction industries. But there will be some danger of overload in the early part of theperiod until demand and capacity for construction are brought more nearly in balance in the later years as the effect of a wider use of industrialised buildingtechniques and the efforts to train more craftsmen are increasingly felt. All thisassumes demand increasing only on the basis of present programmes of public investment and takes no account of the large &quot;fresh potential demands for construction which could arise from new policies, e.g., in the fields mentioned inparagraph 48 above.ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER SERVICES50. On the basis of recent trends, expenditure on central administration and allied services is taken as rising from  410 million in 1963-64 (investment 20 million; current expenditure  390 million) to  431 million in 1967-68(investment  25 million; current expenditure  406 million). Expenditure on other services amounts to  362 million in 1963-64 (investment  20 million; current expenditure  342 million). Because of the estimated increase in receipts by the atomic Energy Authority and the assumption that the Purchasing RepaymentServices Votes will be in balance in 1967-68 (compared with a net expenditure of 43 million in 1963-64), the total of expenditure on other services in 1967-68 isestimated at only  302 million (investment  25 million; current expenditure  277million). The large items in the 1967-68 figure are General Research andDevelopment ( 116 million), Fire ( 50 million), the Courts ( 44 million) and civil defence ( 27 million).CONTINGENCY ALLOWANCE51. The total of expenditures so far estimated is not a reliable forecast ofwhat total public expenditure will be in 1967-68 even on the basis of present policies. Experience shows that such forecasts of expenditure tend to under-estimate the eventual cost of present policies and so there must be an additionfor contingencies. As last year, we make an arbitrary addition of 2\ per cent (or 300 million) for contingencies. There are also factors which will lead to changes of policy and hence greater public expenditure. Some of these, such as the RobbinsCommittee in the field of education, have been mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, but there are other influences making for greater public expendituresome of which cannot even yet be foreseen. The figure of  300 million is not intended to allow for additional expenditure arising from such changes in policy,whether foreseeable or not.ADJUSTMENTS52. Finally, to arrive at an appropriate total of public expenditure for theUnited Kingdom, it is necessary to add Northern Ireland expenditure and tomake certain statistical adjustments.Education; nor has anv specific allowance been made for higher investment inScotland and the North-East of England as a result of the consideration now being given to means of fostering the economic rehabilitation of such areas.
