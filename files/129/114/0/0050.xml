( THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJSST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)IQth^september, 1?63CABINETOPERATION rSCJ^NTFF.It is quite natural for Australia, New Zealand or any othercountries in the Pacific to object to forthcoming French nuclear tests.     They are in the position which the African countriesoccupied when the question of explosions in the Sahara was raised.But, I do not think that we ought to join inj  when it suited us todo so we exploded our bombs off Christmas Island and neither wenor the Americans, nor the Russians can now object to FrenchTests on moral grounds.    I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will agree that it would be better for us not to join in thiscontroversy.H. M.Admiralty House, S. W. 1. .9th September, 1963COPY NO.CONFIDENTIAL
