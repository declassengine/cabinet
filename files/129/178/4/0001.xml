DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO   78CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1974-79:V; THE ECONOMIC FRAMEWORKMemorandum by the Central Policy Review staff. The 1974 Public Expenditure Survey presents Ministers with perhaps the most difficult and intractable decisions they have had to face since the Government took office.2. The economic background is set out in the Chancellor of theExchequer^ memorandum (C(74)-23).    The main conclusions are:-%\a. after taking into account all the likely gains from north sea Oil, if we are to get out of deficit by 1978-79, we shallhave to devote about 20 per cent of the probable increase in national resources over the next five years to the balance ofpayments;b. if we are to sustain our present modest rate of economic growth and provide the capital equipment necessary for full employment in the medium term, we need to increaseproductive investment, both public and private, by up to about per cent a year: this extra investment will pre-empt a further25 per cent of the probable increase in resources up to 1978-79;c. in consequence, if the needs of the balance of payments and productive investment are to be met, little more than half theincrease in resources over the next five years is likely to beavailable for increases in public expenditure and in the realtake-home pay of wage and salary earners;d. if public expenditure is allowed to increase at the 2.\ per cent a year shown in the Public Expenditure Survey, what is left over for private consumption implies a rate of increase in average realtake-home pay of about 1^ per cent a year, or less than half the expected rate of increase of output.C(74) 7924 July 1974
3. Ministers will find it hard to accept these conclusions, if only because: -a. the 2f per cent a year increase in public expenditure makes no provision for the implementation of a large majority of the february Manifesto commitments, and imposes an uncomfort-ably tight squeeze on many existing programmes;b. an average rate of increase of real take-home pay oflj per cent a year is so little that workers&apos; expectations of rising living standards will be frustrated and there will belittle prospect of securing acceptance of any social compactabout pay and prices.4. Ministers may therefore wish to challenge the ChanceUar&apos;aanalysis.    There are four critical questions:-a. Are not the assumptions about the probable increasein resources over-cautious ?In fact, the rate of increase in output assumed is higher thanthat achieved in the past 15 years: it could well proveoptimistic either if North Sea Oil comes on stream late,or if high rates of inflation make it impossible to keepunemployment down to something like its present level.b. Why do we have to aim for balance of payments balanceby 1978-79?   Can we not go more slowly?In fact, even if we get back into external balance by 1978-79,we shall by then have accumulated something like 15, 000 million in overseas debt, and be paying aroundSI. 500j ^year abroad in interest; the longer we postpone the restoration of balance, the larger the debt burden andthe weaker our credibility as a borrower: indeed, thereis a considerable risk of a loss of foreign confidence well before 1978-79.c. Do we really need to provide so much for productive investment?In fact, small changes in the resources put to investment do not affect the picture significantly: large reductions must inevitably reduce the rate of expansion and modernisation in industry, so that in the longer term our rate of economic growth will lag still further.
cfi: r&apos;-j-9 ;--fd.    Why will redistributive taxation of income and wealth notrelease sufficient resources to make possible both fasterincreases in workers&apos; living standards and higher public expenditure ?Redistributive fiscal action is important in relation to socialequity, but it cannot offer a significant source of extraresources for increasing public expenditure or raising realwages:  so far as income is concerned, only 10 per cent of families have pre-tax incomes in excess of twice averageindustrial earnings, and these incomes are already prettyheavily taxed; so far as wealth taxes are concerned, people are likely to pay them by reducing their savings or sellingassets, rather than by reducing their expenditure on goods and services very much, so that the resources released forother purposes will be very small.5. The conclusion from these questions and answers is that the constraints described in the Chancellors paper are genuine.    ministers have practically no room to manoeuvre.6.        If public expenditure is allowed to rise faster than the rateimplied by the Survey, resources will be diverted from the balance ofpayments, with the risks of a sterling crisis, exchange depreciation,and an unavoidable major &quot;stop&quot;: resources will be diverted fromproductive investment, with adverse effects on the future rate ofeconomic growth.7. The \\ per cent a year increase in private consumption is arrivedat, on the Chancellors arithmetic, as a residual.    Ministers should consider the implications of this.    The average wage   and salaryearner will not, in practice, be prepared to be treated as a residual.lj per cent a year is by historical standards very low.   Unless the public in general and trade unionists in particular are prepared to accept thatthe scope for increases in living standards over the next five years isvery limited, it is almost certain that the resulting dissatisfaction willexpress itself in unrealistically large wage claims and unmanageablyaccelerating inflation.    If Ministers feel that increases of if per cent a year in average real take-home pay are too slow, the only way toincrease it without running undue risks with investment and the balanceof payments is to reduce the public expenditure totals below the low levelsshown in the present Survey..8.        Finally, Ministers should be aware that, while the present public expenditure Survey has been put together by officials on the basis of a procedure agreed by Ministers, it is in fact misleadingly optimistic ina number of important respects:-
a. It assumes that defence expenditure is held at its 1974-75level for the next five years;  the present status of the defence review makes this assumption rather questionable.b. It assumes a gradual phasing out of food subsidies: it maywell be difficult to achieve this.c. It assumes increases in nationalised industry prices toreduce their deficits: this may not be politically possible.d. It assumes that expenditure on assistance to trade, industryand employment will be confined to existing commitments and thatthese, eg Concorde, RB 211 and the reconstruction of variousshipyards, will tail off.    No account is taken of new projectscoming forward which will require support from public funds and for which no allowance has been made.ii //&apos;-.&apos;e. No account has been taken of the resource implications of nationalising development land.CONCLUSIONS(1)       Ministers will not be able to take a coherent view of theirpriorities either within or between programmes until they havedecided what the overall limits on the growth of public expenditure should be.(2)       Unless Ministers are prepared to risk a major balance ofpayments crisis, a collapse of foreign confidence, an unmanage-able depreciation of sterling, and a quite inadequate level of productive investment at home, they will need to accept public expenditure ceilings no higher (and preferably lower) than those shown in the 1974 Public Expenditure Survey.(3)       It follows that decisions about actual expenditures on the 5 itemsset out in paragraph 8, and about other bids for extra expenditure,cannot be taken in isolation;  they will need to be fitted into the framework of the present Public Expenditure Survey: where they constitute claims that go beyond the ceilings implied by the2.\ per cent a year increase, they will need to be matched by corresponding reductions in other programmes.(4)       The only alternative to these cuts in public expenditure is that ministers must persuade people that public consumption has priority over private spending - hospitals and schools before cars and clothing.    Whatever else they do, Ministers must not raiseaspirations without the resources to meet them.Cabinet Office24 July 1974 4
