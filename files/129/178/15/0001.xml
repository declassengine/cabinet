The Regeneration of British IndustryINTRODUCTION1. Britain&apos;s prosperity and welfare depend on the wealth generated by itsindustry and all those who work in it. It matters vitally to all of us that Britishindustry should be strong and successful. We need both efficient publicly ownedindustries, and a vigorous, alert, responsible and profitable private sector, workingtogether with the Government in a framework which brings together the interestsof all concerned: those who work in industry, whether in management or on the shop floor, those who own its assets, and those who use its products and depend upon its^ success.2. Since the war we have not as a nation been able   for a variety of reasons,social, economic and industrial   fully to harness the&quot; resources of skill and ability we should be able to command. We have been falling steadily furtherbehind our competitors. We have not found the self-confidence to bridge thatgap; and as it widens, the investment and new industrial relationships that we need if we are to maintain our living standards become progressively moredifficult to secure.3. In 1971, investment for each worker in British manufacturing industry was less than half that in France, Japan or the United States, and well below thatin Germany or Italy. In spite of the measures to encourage investment taken,since then, it has still lagged behind; indeed, it was significantly less in 1972and in 1973 than it was in 1970. Moreover, when it comes to making effective use of our manufacturing equipment, we are less successful than most of our competitors. Because there has not been the demand for investment in manii-facturing industry here, funds that could have been used to improve andmodernise British industry have been deployed elsewhere. In the last ten years the rate of direct investment by British firms overseas has more than trebled.4. Successive Governments have striven to correct these deficiencies, both bygeneral economic measures and by various forms of assistance to industry.But the attitude of Governments to industry, and indeed of industry to Govern-ments, has been too remote, too much coloured by the concept that the Govern-menfs main function towards industry is that of regulation to prevent theactivities of industry, or the abuse of its powers, damaging the interests of other sectors of the community. That relationship is no longer enough. Industry andthe Government should also be partners in the pursuit of the objectives whichspell success for industry and prosperity for this country. This requires a closer,clearer and more positive relationship between Government and industry; andthe construction of that better relationship requires the development of newinstitutions. This White Paper sets out the Government^ proposals for achieving ijthese results.
5. The Government^ main proposals for extending public ownership were set out in the manifesto on which the Labour Party fought the last GeneralElection, and are now being presented to Parliament and the public in greater detail. They include proposals for community ownership of development land,the establishment of the British National Oil Corporation, the nationalisation of the shipbuilding and aircraft industries, the extension of public ownershipin the road haulage and construction industries, and schemes for bringingcommercial ports and cargo handling activities under public ownership andcontrol.6. In pursuit of the more general objectives for the relationship between government and industry which have already been described, the government propose in this White Paper the creation of two new instruments: a system of planning Agreements with major firms in key sectors of industry, and a. national enterprise Board to provide the means for direct public initiatives in particularkey sectors of industry.7. Planning Agreements will bring about a closer understanding betweencompanies   workforce as well as management   and the Government onthe aims to be followed and the plans to be adopted in pursuit of them. Theywill not only help to ensure that the plans of companies are in harmony with national needs and objectives; they will also provide a securer and more coherentbasis than has existed in the past for ensuring that Government financial assist-ance is deployed where it will be most effectively used. A fuller exchange ofinformation will be an essential ingredient in Planning Agreements; the informa-tion which companies provide in this context will be used for this purpose only.8; The National Enterprise Board will take over the ownership of the sharesthat the Government now hold in a number of companies. It will be a newsource of investment capital for industry, able to provide capital by loan oracquisition of shares - though the general rule will be that, where the Boardprovides such capital, it should take a proportionate share in the ownership ofthe firm. It will act as the agent of the Government in the efficient restructuringof industry. It will be able to channel grants to companies in difficulties. In all its activities it will pay close attention to regional development opportunities.For many of its activities the Board will be able to follow the pattern and buildoh the experience of the former Industrial Reorganisation Corporation.9. These proposals will be presented to Parliament in a new Industry Bill;and, as the need arises, appropriate changes will be proposed in company law.In the meantime, the Governments intentions are more fully set out in the. restof. this White Paper, so that the private sector of industry will know where it stands and can press ahead with its own plans for development.10. The Government believe that this new initiative will contribute to the achievement of greater industrial efficiency, more and better investment, anda higher return on that investment. By thus entering into explicit partnership with industry, the Government expect to raise the quality of management;develop industrial democracy, and improve both the quantity and the quality of manufacturing industry&apos;s contribution to the development and growth of the economy on which the prosperity of all of us depends.   &apos;
PLANNING AGREEMENTS11. In their application to the private sector Planning Agreements will providea new and improved framework for co-operation between the Government and leading industrial companies. A Planning Agreement will not be an agreement in the sense of a civil contract enforceable at law. It will, however, be givensufficient recognition by statute to enable the company concerned to rely on assistance promised under it. The Act which gives effect to the new system willalso provide reserve powers,to require the relevant companies to provide theGovernment and the workers in the firm with the information needed to formu-late and monitor a Planning Agreement. There will, however, be no statutoryrequirement upon a company to conclude an Agreement.12. \The heart, of this system,will be a series of consultations between theGovernment and companies, leading to an agreement about plans for thefollowing three years; these will be reviewed and rolled forward annually. In thecourse of these consultations, the Government will assess with the company itsneeds for assistance to support and reinforce agreed company plans, with special reference to selective assistance for new employment projects in the regions.In particular, if in the course of these discussions it becomes clear that in orderto align, the company&apos;s plans with national needs some financial assistance isrequired beyond that which would in any case be available to the company.byway of capital allowances, regional development aid and regional employment premium, the Government will be ready to provide the kind of discretionaryfinancial assistance by way of grants and loans for which the Industry Act 1972now provides. They will discuss with the company the scale on which and thepurposes for which this assistance should be provided, so as to meet the require-ments of individual recipients and to further the achievement of nationalobjectives. In order that companies shall have greater certainty in making and carrying out their plans, the Government intend that once an Agreement hasbeen concluded, regional assistance for the projects which it covers will, duringthe currency of the Agreement, not fall below the rates in force at the time ofthe Agreement. Moreover these discussions could help to identify requirements for investment funds for consideration by the National Enterprise Board, ifnecessary by means of joint ventures with the companies. More generally, theintention is that the outcome of discussions with companies will have animportant bearing on the formulation of the Governments own plans; in thisway the needs of companies and the economy will be better served.13. Financial assistance under the Industry Act 1972, including regional development grants, will of course continue to be available for companies notcoveredby Planning Agreements, as well as those entering into Agreements whichsatisfy criteria for assistance. The payment of regional employment premiumand capital allowances will not be affected by any of these proposals. ..14. The principal application of Planning Agreements will be to large com-pameSj but in times of economic difficulty it is often the small businessman,dependent to a great extent on personal wealth as a source of finance, whosuffers the greatest hardship. The Government are therefore reviewing theproblems of small businesses and will put forward separate proposals to cater for their special needs.
15. In their discussions with companies, the Government will be concerned only with strategic issues. In addition, they regard it as most important thatthe new arrangements should not restrict the freedom of companies to respond to market changes, particularly where they are in competition with overseasmanufacturers. The Government would welcome the views of firms on the issues that principally concern them. Clearly they might well vary from company to company but matters of obvious concern to the Government would include:Investment, with particular reference to its timing and location;Prices policy;Productivity;Employment, with special reference to its regional balance;Exports and import saving, and investment directed to these ends;Product development;Implications of company plans for industrial relations and arrangementsfor negotiation and consultation;Interests of consumers and the community.16. The Government recognise that, even in relation to a small number ofimportant issues of this kind, companies&apos; plans and forecasts which go beyondthe immediate future may be subject to change at short notice in response to market fluctuations. Despite these reservations and uncertainties the Govern-ment believe that the new relationship they are seeking with companies andthe associated financial assistance will benefit the companies taking part andwill lead to better arrangements for the management of the economy.Companies to be Covered17. The new arrangements will apply to major and strategic firms in keysectors of manufacturing industry, and in selected industries other than manu-facturing of particular importance to the economy. Multinational companies will be included only in respect of their British holdings. It will not however be possible to operate Planning Agreements from the very outset so that theycover all the companies that will eventually fall within their scope. A transitional period will be necessary, both for the companies themselves and for Govern-ment Departments which will need to develop adequate arrangements to handle without delay the plans that are put to them. The Government are determined to see that the benefits of the new arrangements they proposeshould be secured with the minimum of extra administrative cost for the com-panies concerned and for the Government service. They will therefore beselective in their initial approach. They will introduce Planning Agreements in selected sectors of particular importance, beginning with companies in sectorswhich, like the engineering industry, lie at the heart of our export effort.18. The major nationalised industries and publicly-owned firms will alsofall within the scope of the Planning Agreements system, which for them willbe administered through the sponsoring Departments. Their relationship with government is already very close, and extends beyond the relevant statutes
governing the nationalised industries into, for example, the joint scrutiny of their corporate plans. Recent years have seen the introduction of arrange-ments by which the nationalised industries and major publicly-owned firmssubmit corporate plans to the Government, and by which Departments monitortheir progress at regular intervals against an annual operating plan.The Interests of Employees19. Employees and their representatives will have a major interest in the issues covered by Planning Agreements. The Government intend that the plans to be covered by an Agreement will be drawn up by management in close consultation with trade union representatives from the firm. The framing andupdating of Agreements will thus involve a continuing discussion between management and unions and will constitute an important advance in the part to be played by industrial democracy in the planning of company strategy.The Government envisage that union representatives from companies, while not formally parties to Planning Agreements, would also take part where they so wished in consultations on Agreements with the Government.20. If consultation is to be effective, union representatives must be provided with all the necessary information relevant to the contents of Planning Agree-ments. The Government will therefore require employers to disclose informationof this kind, except where disclosure could seriously prejudice the company&apos;commercial interests or would be contrary to the interests of national security.Consultation21. The Government propose to enter into immediate discussions with bothsides of industry, and with the National Economic Development Council, aboutthe best means of implementing the new system and the sectors of industryin which it might most usefully be first employed. The Governmenfs intentionthroughout is to look for arrangements which are simple and flexible and basedso far as possible on the existing planning arrangements of individual companies.The kind of procedural arrangements which might lead up to a PlanningAgreement are briefly described in an Annex.Information to be Provided by Government22. The Governmenfs projections and the companies&apos; own intentions and plans will interact on each other: the primary purpose of a Planning agreement is that they should. In producing their projections the Government will need totake account of companies&apos; own plans, while the companies will for their partwant to know the Governmenfs views on the likely development of the economy.In this way the Government and the companies concerned will share with eachother their developing assessments of future trends. The Government would welcome the views of those responsible for corporate planning in industry aboutthe information which would be of the greatest value to them and how it mightmost suitably be disseminated. The question is not whether Governmentprojections should be supplied within the context of Planning Agreements but which projections, given the unavoidable uncertainties, are likely to be of mostvalue.
NATIONAL ENTERPRISE BOARD23. The Government propose to create a new instrument to secure where necessary large-scale sustained investment to offset the effects of the short-termpull of market forces. These new powers of initiative are better exercised through a new agency than dealt with direct by Government, and for this purpose it isproposed to set up a National Enterprise Board (not).24. One of the functions of this new agency will be to build on and enlargethe activities,previously discharged by the Industrial Reorganisation Corpora-tion (1958-59). It will in addition be an industrial holding company with subsidiary companies in manufacturing industry. A number of existing Governmentshareholdings in companies will be transferred to the Board immediately oh its establishment. Adequate funds will be made available to enable the Board,subject to Governmental and Parliamentary control as set out in paragraphs38-40, to&quot; expand its activities vigorously to discharge the responsibilities setout below:a. It will be a new source of investment capital for manufacturing industry;in providing finance it will normally take a corresponding share in the equity capital. In this it will set out to supplement and not to displace thesupply of investment from existing financial institutions and from com-panies&apos;own resources (see paragraph 27).b. It will have the former Industrial Reorganisation Corporation^entrepreneurial role in promoting industrial efficiency and profitability bypromoting or assisting the reorganisation or development of an industry but, unlike the 1958-59, the not will in general retain the shareholdings itacquires. In discharging these functions it may take financial interests incompanies or act in a purely advisory role (see paragraph 28).c. It will act as a holding company to control and exercise central manage-ment of:i. certain existing Government shareholdings vested in it;ii. interests taken into public ownership under powers in the industry act 1972, which it is proposed to consolidate and extend;iii. new. acquisitions under the arrangements described in para-graphs 30-33.d. It will be a channel through which the Government will assist soundcompanies which are in short-term financial or managerial difficulties(sec paragraph 32).e. It will be an instrument through which the Government operate directly to create employment in areas of high unemployment (see paragraph 35).f. Government Departments, the nationalised industries and private firmswill be able to seek the advice of the not on financial and managerialissues.
g. Its main strength in manufacturing will come through the extension ofpublic ownership into profitable manufacturing industry by acquisitionsof individual firms in accordance with paragraphs 30-33 below.h. It will have power to start new ventures and participate in joint ventureswith companies in the private sector.25. The Board will be responsible for securing the efficient management of thecompanies and assets vested in it. It will compete with companies in the private sector and be expected to operate in accordance with suitable financial objec-tives. Its guiding financial objective will be to secure an adequate return on that part of the nation&apos;s capital for which it is responsible. When the Governmentrequire the not to depart from this objective on social grounds, the subsidieswill be administered by the not, and will be separately accounted for. TheBoard&apos;s financial arrangements will bave to be carefully worked out to safeguard against uneconomic allocation of the nation&apos;s resources.Industrial Democracy26. The Government envisage a major development of industrial democracythroughout industry in the years ahead. Within that framework, the not will play its part in ensuring that enterprises under its control provide for the fullinvolvement of employees in decision-making at all levels.Provision of Investment Capital27. Within the framework of Governmental control outlined below (seeparagraph 38), the not will have powers to make loans and to take share-holdings in companies where it considers that such action is in the publicinterest and in particular when in its judgement lack of finance is prejudicingworthwhile industrial development. In deciding which projects to support within its financial allocation, it will be expected to give priority to the promotion ofindustrial efficiency; to the creation of employment opportunities in assisted areas; to increasing exports or reducing undue dependence on imports; toco-operation with the Offshore Supplies Office in promoting development in theoffshore oil supplies industry; and to sponsoring investment that will offset theeffect of monopoly.Restructuring Industries28. : In exercising its powers to promote or assist in the reorganisation ordevelopment of an industry the Board may take a share in the equity capital ofexisting companies or take part in the establishment of new enterprises. Whenit is involved in restructuring programmes, its overriding purpose will be topromote the effectiveness and efficiency of the industry. It will work closely with the Department of Industry which will be able to complement initiativesby the not through the use of its powers of selective financial assistance underthe Industry Act 1972.Vesting Existing Government Shareholdings29. The Government have a number of existing shareholdings in industry.Their acquisition over a large number of years has been in response to a diverserange of policy objectives. Some of these holdings may not be appropriate for
vesting in the not eg, the holdings in shipbuilding companies or in companieswhose activities are largely overseas (the British Petroleum Co. Ltd., cable and Wireless Ltd. and the Suez Finance Company). It is however intended thatthe Government shareholdings in the following companies should be vested in the not:Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd.International Computers (Holdings) Ltd.George Kent Ltd.Nuclear Enterprises Ltd.Dunford and Elliott Ltd.Kearney and Trecker Marwin Ltd.Norton Villiers Triumph Ltd.Future Acquisitions30. The not will be the instrument by which the Government ensure thatthe nation&apos;s resources are deployed to the benefit of all, by extending public ownership into profitable manufacturing industry in accordance with the policies defined in paragraphs 31-33 below.31. Acquisitions by, or on behalf of, the not may take place in a number of ways. The intention is that all holdings in companies, whether 100 per centor in part, should be acquired by agreement. Where part holdings in. companiesmay be acquired in future in return for assistance from the Government underthe Industry Act 1972 they will normally be held by the not. The Board may also acquire part holdings in companies through joint ventures or through itsparticipation in a reorganisation. But to act decisively in its role of creatingemployment and creating new industrial capacity, the Board will need a numberof companies where it holds 100 per cent of the equity capital, in order to avoidconflict between its objectives and the interests of private shareholders. TheGovernment consider that suitable criteria for the acquisition of a company should include the following: danger of its passing into unacceptable foreigncontrol; and stimulation of competition in a sector where that is weak.32. Although the not will be principally concerned with profitable com-panies, it may on occasion be called on to take over an ailing company whichis in. danger of collapse but needs to be maintained and restored to a sound economic basis for reasons of regional employment or industrial policy. this responsibility of the not will be distinct from its other functions, and it will be separated in such a way from them that the not will be compensated specifically -cally for this rescue activity, to ensure that its overall financial discipline andviability are not undermined. The Board may also be asked to act in supportof financial measures by the Secretary of State for Industry to assist a company in temporary difficulty, for example by providing managerial reinforcement.33. Together with the separate proposals in paragraph 5, the preceding paragraphs represent the whole of the Governmenfs policy towards public ownership for the next Parliament. If in any case compulsory acquisition
proved to be necessary, this would normally be authorised by a specific Act ofParliament. If unforeseeable developments of compelling urgency were to arise   for example, the imminent failure or loss to unacceptable foreigncontrol of an important company in a key sector of manufacturing industry  the Government would bring the issue before Parliament, and any action would require specific parliamentary approval. Compulsory acquisitions wouldbe subject to prompt and fair compensation to existing shareholders.The Official Trustee34.  The Government wish however to retain other means of dealing withfactory closures in the private sector on those occasions when, for social and economic reasons, it is desirable to find some way of keeping a plantin operation while Government Departments and other interests concernedconsider whether and in what manner a permanent solution to the resultingproblems can be found. To supplement the powers that already exist under sections 7 and 8 of the Industry Act 1972, which enable financial assistance to .be provided in order to sustain productive capacity, it may therefore be desir-able to provide for the intervention of a Government Manager or Trusteewho would take over temporary responsibility for handling the crisis. But ,such a proposal inevitably raises difficult issues of company law and will need&quot;further study before decisions can be taken by the Government.Creating Jobs35. The Government recognise the importance industry attaches to stability and certainty in financial incentives to stimulate industrial and commercialexpansion in areas of high unemployment. But the experience of the last25 years shows that financial incentives are by themselves inadequate: theGovernment need a power of direct action and the National Enterprise board will therefore have a responsibility on its behalf to create employment throughcommercially sound public enterprises and joint ventures with private enter-prise in the areas of high unemployment. Its subsidiary companies will qualify for financial assistance under the Industry Act 1972 on the same terms ascomparable companies in the private sector.Financial Arrangements36. The National Enterprise Board will be funded by the Government and theSecretary of State for Industry will be empowered, with the approval of theTreasury, to make funds available by way of loans or in the form of publicdividend capital. This is capital which does not bear a fixed rate of interest,but on which a public corporation is expected to pay a dividend similar todividends on equity shares in private companies. Since the not will be com-competing with the private sector and is intended primarily to operate withinprofitable sectors of manufacturing industry, it is appropriate that apart of itsfunds should have the character of equity rather than of fixed interest finance.37. As envisaged in paragraph 27 the Board will be a source of finance for the1companies in which it holds shares, and for any new public enterprise which itestablishes. The not&apos;s internal financial relationships with its subsidiary
companies will be for it to settle with them. The not will be given financial obligations which reflect its duty of securing the efficient management in thepublic interest of the companies vested in it. Detailed financial guidelines forthis purpose will be prescribed by the Government.Relations with the Government38. Within the framework of its constitution and the funds made availableto it, the not will be free to exercise its commercial judgement in carryingout the functions described in paragraph 24 above. It will however requirethe prior agreement of the Government before it takes a controlling interestin any enterprise or a minority interest exceeding  5 million. There will alsobe occasions when the Government will wish to influence the activities of theBoard and its constituent companies in the national interest. The Governmentwill therefore need a power to give general and specific directions to the Board.The Government will not however interfere in detailed issues of day-to-day management. Directions to the not will have to be given in writing by theGovernment and will be published in due course in the Board&apos;s annual report.Parliamentary Control39. The not will be set up under a new Industry Bill which will consolidateand develop existing legislation to promote national industrial expansion.The Board will be accountable for its actions to the Government who; in turn, will be fully accountable to Parliament for the funds which it makesavailable to the Board. In addition, the Board will produce an annual report and accounts which will be laid before Parliament and its activities, like thoseof any other major public sector body, will come under review by the appropriateParliamentary Committee.40. The Government already have powers under Sections 7 and 8 of theIndustry Act 1972 to provide financial assistance to a company by takingshare capital. These powers of agreed share purchase will be widened and made permanent. The Government propose that parliamentary control ofthis extended power should be on the lines of Section 8 of the Industry Act,ie expenditure on a single acquisition in excess of  5 million should beauthorised by Resolution of the House of Commons under main legislation which provides the means by which this is to be done,Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland41. The Government have announced their intention to introduce legislationsetting up in Scotland a Scottish Development Agency,- responsible to theSecretary of State, which will be given a substantial measure of responsibilityfor the promotion of industrial and economic development.42. The Government consider that the most effective assistance and support for the modernisation and growth of Scottish industry will be achieved by giving the Scottish Development Agency executive responsibilities over a wide field. It has therefore been decided that appropriate functions of the
not should be carried out in Scotland by the Scottish Development Agency,and that the Agency should be fully associated with the Board in considerationof matters of relevance to employment and economic growth in Scotland.Similar arrangements will be made for Wales, on the basis envisaged in theSecretary of State for Energy&apos;s Report to Parliament of 11 July 1974 aboutUnited Kingdom off-shore oil and gas policy. Industrial development inNorthern Ireland is a transferred matter under the Northern Ireland con-stitution, and the relationship between the not and the Northern Irishauthorities is under consideration.
AnnexPLANNING AGREEMENT procedure. A Planning Agreement will not be an agreement in the sense of a civilcontract enforceable at law. It will, instead, reflect the outcome of discussions between a company, the unions.and the Government during the course of whichit is hoped that agreement will have been reached about the shape and directionof the company&apos;s plans and their relationship to the Governments economic objectives. The kind of information which each company is asked to providewill aim to reflect that company&apos;s own planning system and its accountingarrangements. In companies with corporate planning arrangements the normalpattern is for plans to be revised annually and rolled forward for a further year.At the same time account is taken of the extent to which the company has succeeded in achieving its planning objectives in the past year.2. The Government have it in mind that Planning Agreements should reflectthis approach: companies would be asked to provide the appropriate Govern-ment Department and unions with information of three main kinds. First, therewould be information relating, perhaps, to the two or three years immediatelypast. In the early stages, while experience of Planning Agreements was being built up, it would obviously be helpful if this material could be providedsomewhat in advance of information about future plans so that the GovernmentDepartment concerned could familiarise itself with the company&apos;s situation in preparation for the forthcoming discussions.3. Second, companies would be asked to provide forecasts relating to the topicsto be covered by an Agreement and looking three years ahead. They would alsobe asked to give an indication of any longer term plans which they might havewhich would be likely to affect the main development of the company or itspattern of investment, employment or trading activity. Third, the company would as a separate matter be asked to keep the Department in touch with anyintended major departures from its plans as and when they arose.4. The Agreement itself would normally be for a period of three years, althoughit would be reviewed annually in the light of progress over the previous yearand rolled forward for a further year.Printed in England for Her Ma]esty&apos;s Stationery Office by Oyez Press LimitedDd 139340 K 240  8/74
