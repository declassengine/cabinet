DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 84 COPY NO       f g26 July 1974CABINETNATIONAL SUPERANNUATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. In our Election Manifesto we promised pensions of  10 for a single person and  16 for a married couple; we undertook to link further pensionsupratings to earnings rather than price movements; and we promised toreplace the previous Administration^ long-term pensions plan with ourown.2.        We have made an excellent start.    The  10 and  16 pensions arenow in payment.    Legislation linking the next pension uprating to earningsmovement has been enacted.    We now need to get on with our long-term plan for pensions.    I have promised a White Paper about this as soon aspossible; it is essential to publish no later than September.    We havecleared the way by cancelling the previous Administration^ plans for areserve pensions scheme and the occupational pensions scheme arrange-ments that went with it, primarily on the grounds of their inadequacy andthe fact that they took far too long to make any significant impact on the dependence of pensioners on supplementary benefit,SUMMARY OF MY PROPOSALS3,        My proposals went before the Social Services Committee and received that Committee&apos;s general endorsement.    The main featuresare described in Annex A, and I attach as Annex B the draft of the white paper in which, if colleagues approve, they will appear.    They may besummarised as follows:i. BenefitsRetirement pensions will be  1 for every  1 of average weekly earnings up to a base level, and a quarter of those earnings betweenthe base level and a ceiling.The base level will be set at the amount of the single flat-ratepension in force when the scheme is introduced and the ceilingwill be seven times that amount.    In current terms therefore the base level will be  10 a week and the ceiling  70.    Thesefigures are used in the Annex, and will be used in the White Paper,
for illustrative purposes.    When the scheme is in force they will berevalued each year in line with the movement of average earnings.The first full pensions will be payable after 20 years, and thereafter the calculation of pension will be based on the contributor^ best 20years of earnings.    The maximum single pension (in current terms)will be  25 a week.Widows will inherit the whole of their husband&apos;s pension entitlement,to which they may add, after age 60, a quarter of their own earnings above the base level, subject to a maximum.Maintenance of value.    The earnings on which pensions will be calculated will be revalued in line with the movement of average earnings.    The base level pension will similarly go up in line with earnings, and the remainder of the pension will get no less thanprice-protection after award.ii. Contracting outOccupational schemes which give pensions of at least 1^ per cent(one-eightieth) of earnings each year will be eligible to contract outof the 25 per cent element of personal retirement pension, providedthat they guarantee an occupational pension which is equivalent orbetter.    Contracted-out schemes will also be required to providehalf of that part of widow&apos;s pension which is related to earnings abovethe base level.    The balance needed to make this widow&apos;s benefit upto what the State scheme will provide will be paid out of the national insurance Fund and the State will also finance the price-protectionafter award of both the personal pensions and the widows&apos; pensions for which contracted-out schemes have taken over responsibilityfrom the State.    However the final details of contracting out (onwhich a fuller note is attached at Annex C) will not be settled until after consultation with the representatives of occupational pension schemes.    This consultation will take place after the White paper is published and a minimum of three months must be allowed for it.iii. ContributionsWhen an employee earns more than the base level he and his employer will pay earnings-related contributions on all his earnings up to the ceiling.    Married women will not be allowed to opt out ofpension cover, but may retain an option for short-term benefits.I would propose to leave a final decision on this until after the consultations which will follow the publication of the White Paper.Annex D, prepared by the Government Actuary&apos;s Department, shows the estimated cost of the scheme over its first 30 years,    I propose an initial contribution of 16   per cent of earnings up to the scheme&apos;sceiling, shared between employer and employee on the basis that the employee will pay 67 per cent of earnings and his employer 10 percent,    (This compares with a combined contribution of 14 per cent,divided 5-f- per cent:8^ per cent, from next April.)   On earnings2
above the base level, however, the smaller State benefits availableto the contracted-out will be reflected in a reduced contribution.The contracted-out employee will pay 4 per cent of those earnings,and his employer 6 per cent,COST AND STAFFING4.        The extra annual cost of the benefits proposed, compared with present benefits, will build up slowly and is shown in Table 1 of Annex D,with variations according to the number contracted out (ranging from fourt eight million).    If, for instance, there are six million contracted out,the extra cost after the first year will bei around  135 million, after fiveyears  270 million, after ten years  520 million, after 20 years 1, 290 million and after 30 years  2, 240 million (though in termsof constant prices, which is the basis used for the Public expenditure survey, the costs would be higher, as explained in the footnote to Table 1.These figures are of gross cost; they do not take account of savings on supplementary benefits, nor of the extra tax yield.    Further, they assume the abolition of the contribution option for all married women, including those who have already &quot;opted out&quot;.    The retention of an option for short-term benefits, as I now envisage, would reduce the cost by about 75 million in the scheme&apos;s early years, rising to  100 million later.It would also largely eliminate any need for extra staff: if short-termbenefit cover became compulsory for working wives an extra 2, 300 people would be required in the Department of Health and Social Security andanother 2, 100 in the Department of Employment.THE DRAFT WHITE paper .        The Social Services Committee agreed that I should circulate tothe Cabinet a draft of a White Paper, taking account of a number of points made by the Paymaster General.    These points have since been discussed with him and on most of them agreement has been reached on the way inwhich they should be treated in the White Paper.    This is reflected in theattached draft.    We were agreed, for instance, that the best way of givinghelp to existing pensioners would be through some system of negativeincome tax, if one can be devised.    This is being studied urgently.If it proves possible to devise an acceptable system and this can beagreed in time, I would propose to leave in the White Paper the first of the two alternative paragraphs 9 of the foreword and paragraph 7 in chapter 1, which at present appear in the attached draft in square brackets.If, as seems possible, however, we cannot be sure about this by the timethe White Paper has to be printed, paragraph 7 will have to be dropped andthe second of the two alternative paragraphs 9 will have to be used.    In thisversion, there are two alternative endings, indicated by square brackets;the first of these is the one which the Paymaster General would prefer, thesecond is the one I would prefer.6.        The only other passage in the draft which is still square bracketedis in paragraph 20 in Chapter 2.    This refers to the retention of thepresent pensionable ages of 65 for men and 60 for women and I have3
agreed to omit any reference to the possibility of a reduction in the pension age for men. The Paymaster General would prefer the sentence in square brackets to be omitted also.7.        Further paragraphs on the economic implications of my proposals are being drafted and will be circulated as Annex E to this paper.    also being drafted, but not yet available, is the Government Actuary&apos;s reportpn my proposals.conclusion.        I ask my colleagues for their agreement to the publication of a white paper on the lines of the attached draft, subject to such drafting, or other minor changes as may prove necessary.    We should aim to publish it, ifpossible, before the annual Trades Union Congress early in September.BAGDepartment of Health and Social Security26 July\19744
Annex ATHE PROPOSED SCHEME OP NATIONAL SUPERANNUATION3C0:-&apos;E AND MEMBERSHIP OP mi scheme,  The scheme will apply to employees whose earnings are at the base level( 10 a week in 1974 terms) or above.   The self-employed will also be covered.They will pay flat-rate contributions entitling them to pension at the baselevel of  10.   They will also pay &quot;earnings-related&quot; contributions on a partof their earnings, but it is not proposed at the present time to give a benefit return on them.   Non-earners and employees with earnings below the base level will not be covered compulsorily but. there will be a facilityfor them to pay voluntary flat-rate contributions to maintain a record atthe base level.   Those who are not in employment but are caring for childrenor for sick or aged dependants will, retain their membership of the scheme.Membership of itself will not actually earn benefit, but will help to satisfy the four-fifths test - see 3.2 below. llPENSIONS:   GENERAL PROVISIONS2.1  Pensions will be based on the average of earnings in the contributorsbest 20 years.   Earnings up to the base level of  10 a week will produce apension on a  1 fox  1 basis; and earnings between  10 and the ceiling of 70 a week will produce a pension at the 25$ rate.   In 1974 terms, therefore,the maximum pension will be made up of a base level of  10 plus 25$ of  60,making  25 a week in all.2.2 The scheme &apos;s base and ceiling levels will go up annually in line with earnings,The earnings of contributors will be revalu d each year so that they maintain their relationship with the base level up to the time that the pension iscalculateds the value of pensions in payment will also be protected - the baselevel ( 10) going up in line with the movement of earnings and the upper tier(2$) receiving no less than price-protection.2,3 People claiming pension in the scheme&apos;s first 20 years will not qualify for the full 2jfo of earnings above the base level but for l^jfo for each year of earnings in the scheme.   The full  1 for  1 return on earnings up to the baselevel will however be payable for the majority on their existing records.RETIREMENT PENSION3.1  The present pensionable ages of 65 for men and 60 for women will beretained,   because    of    the    cost    that   would    be    involvedboth    for    the      economy    and   the    scheme    inlowering    the    pension    age    for  men.The retirement condition and earnings rulewill remain, but the level at which the earnings rule affects pensions will beregularly reviewed.   People who defer retirement will qualify L&apos;or additions totheir pensions.3.2  A full pension calculated as in 2.1 above - will be paid provided thatthe contributor has been a member of the scheme for four-fifths of the taxyears from that which includes the 19th birthday to the last complete year before pension age, inclusive.   If the four-fifths test is not satisfied therewill be a reduction in the pension.   If scheme membership has been achieved infewer than one-fifth of the relevant years, no pension at all will be payable,3.3 Married women who pay contributions will qualify for pensions.   the pension of  6 paid to the wife of a pensioner on his contributions will continue.Where there is entitlement to both pensions there will be no duplication betweenthe  6 pension and the wife&apos;s own base level entitlement, but she will receive any pension derived from her earnings above the base level.
Tables A and B below illustrate&quot; in 1974 terms the amounts payable toa single person or a married couple after contributions have been paid for the full maturity period of 20 years.   Tables C and D illustrateentitlement on the same basis as table A but for those who claim pensionafter 5 or 10 years of the scheme.TABLE a table A assumes that the wife has not contributed and that her entitlementon her husband contributions is at the current level of  6 a week.PENSION AFTJR 20 YEARS(V/ife not earning)Contributor1 s	Married couple&apos;s	$ of	Single Person1s	&amp; of weekly earnings	Pension	earnings	Pension	earnings 	 		 	20	18.50	92	12.50	6230	21.00	70	15.00	5040	23.50	59	17.50	4450	26.00	52	20.00	4060	28.50	47	22.50	3770	31.00	44	25.00	36TABLE B				Table B illustrates the position where both the husband and the wi&apos;fe havesatisfied the four-fifths test and where one has the average earnings(over 20 years) set out in the first column and the other has earned  20a week.PENSION AFTER 20 YEARS(both husband and wife earning)Main SubsidiaryBreadwinner (Wife or Husband&apos;s(Husband or wife&apos;s weekly earnings)weekly earnings)MainPensionJointPensionSubsidiary   Joint    1&quot; of totPension Pension   earnii 	 	 	 	      ...	20	20	12.50	12.50	25.00	6230	20	15.00	12.50	27.50	5540	20	17.50	12.50	30.00	5050	20	f 20.00	12.50	32.50	4660	20	/   22.50   -	12.50	35.00	4470	20	25.00	12.50	37.50	42

Graduatedentitlement will also be revalued in line with the movement of earnings.WIDOWS PENSIONS4.1   The.widow s full -pension and the personal element of widowed mothersallowance will be equal to the retirement or invalidity pension which the husband was drawing or had earned at his death.   The husband will need tohave established scheme membership in at lea3t one year.   Where he had lessthan 20 years of earnings, ba3e level earnings will be credited to his recordfor sufficient years to make up 20.Ml - &apos;        ...... .-3.Tables C and D like table A assume that the wife has not contributedand that her entitlement on her. husband^ contributions, is at the current level of  6 a week.
4.2  Childless widows between 40 and 50 will qualify for a reduced pension,but those under 40 at widowhood (or when their children cease to be dependant) will get no long-term benefit.   This is the present position.4.3   From age 60 a widow - irrespective of her age at widowhood - will be&apos; able to add 25$ of her own earnings above the base level to her pension on her husband^ record (subject to the limitation that her total pensionmay not exceed the maximum payable on one record).Table E shows in 1974 terms the pension that will be payable to widowsover 60 who have had. earnings of their own.TABLE ERETIREMENT PENSION PAYABLE TO A WIDOWHer average  Late husband1 s     Pull pension       Addition on     Total retirementearnings   average earnings   on his earnings   her earnings Pension                                 10 20 12.50 nil 12.5020 20 12.50 2.50 1 5.0030 30 15.00 5.00 20.0040 40 17.50 7.50 25.00 (Maximum)50 60 22.50 2.50 25.00 (Maxuram)(immaterial) 70 25.00 nil 25.00 (Maisimum)WIDOWERS5.   The scheme will improve the retirement and invalidity provision for widowers.A man who is over 65 when his wife dies will have his retirement pension cabulateofon the same formula as will apply for a widow - see Table E above.   For a manunder 65 when his wife dies there will be a right to an invalidity pension, ifhe is sick, on her record if it is better than his own,INVALIDITY PENSIONS6.1   These will be calculated on the retirement pension.earned up to the onsetof sickness, with earnings at the base level credited into the record ifnecessary to make up 20 years of earnings.6.2    Invalidity allowance will be improved so that the highest weekly rate willbecome payable to people incapacitated before age 40 (rather than 35 as at presentand the intermediate rate to those falling sick before age 50 (instead of 45).DEPENDANTS7.   The dependence of adults and children will continue to be recognized byflat-rate additions to the personal benefit.   The right of a married woman toa retirement pension on her husband&apos;s insurance will continue (see paragraph3.3).
SHORT-TERM BENEFITSCONFIDENTIAL8.    These are being considered separately.The intention is that these benefits should fit in with the new pensionstructure. fOCCUPATIONAL TENSION SCHEMES9.1    Schemes which provide an accrual rate of l  per cent of earnings(eightieths) per year, or better, may apply to contract out of the 25 per oentpart of the retirement pension.   Schemes contracted out will be termed qualifyingschemes and they and their members will pay reduced contributions on earnings between the base, level.   The schemes will have to guarantee that the pension theypay will not be below what the member would have got from the state scheme.9.2  Suoh contributors will retain full state cover for invalidity.   Asregards widowhood the widow of a contracted-out contributor will be guaranteed by his occupational scheme half of the pension appropriate to his earnings abovethe base level.    The State will retain the liability for upratlngs of pensions,both for retirement and widowhood.9.3    The reduction in the contributions paid by contracted out contributorstheir employers will be calculated on the basis of the benefits forgone.   It willbe age-averaged, so that the reduction will be the same for contributors of allages but the possibility of different reductions for employers of men and womenwill be considered.94    All occupational schemes (whether qualifying or not) will be subject togeneral requirements governing for example preservation (as in currentlegislation), equality of treatment for women, and representation of schememembers on boards of management.CONTRIBUTIONS10.1 Fall membership of the scheme will depend for each year on contributionsbeing paid or credited in respect of earnings at the base level, or on the need to stay at home to care for children or for sick or aged dependants.   The greataajority of the working population, and women looking after their children will therefore be covered.   The self-employed will be within the scheme, and will pay a flat-rate contribution plus 8 per oent of their earnings between three times the base level ( 30 a week, in 1974 terms) and the scheme s oeiling. ,,10.2  The percentage contributions will be:-

National insurancebeneficiaries who receive sickness or unemployment benefit, invalidity pensionor maternity or widows1 allowance will be credited with earnings to the extent necessary to maintain a record at the base level.10 . 4 A Treasury supplement of 18 per cent will be payable on all contributions:in the case of contracted out contributions it will be calculated as if full andnot reduced contributions had been paid.6
Annex BCONFIDENTIALBETTER PENSIONS FOR ALLGUARANTEE!) AGAINST INFLATIONI, KREWOED BY THE RT HON BARBARA CASTLE   mp secretary OF STATE FOR SOCIAL services,    I have called this white Paper &quot;Better Pensions for All&quot; because that isprecisely what it is about.   It describes a comprehensive, plan for betterpensions for every pensioner, present and fixture, those in occupational schemes and those without such cover.     I invite the fullest public debate and discussion on these proposals.2.    They fulfil the Government&apos;s pledge to bring to an end the massive dependence on means-tested supplementary benefits which is the sad hallmark of old age today.Die scheme will provide better pensions in retirement,in widowhood and chronicill health.   It will bring security at the end of working life to all our people,including the many millions who at present lack the advantages and cover of agood occupational scheme.5,    In return for earnings-related contributions the scheme&apos; will provide earnings-related pensions fully protected against inflation at all times, both duringworking life and after they are put into payment.   This is one of the most preciousassets of the scheme, as people already retired on fixed Incomes will testify.Moreover, we have designed our proposals to help particularly the lower paid.4.    The new scheme will operate in partnership with well-founded occupational schemes, whose members will gain considerable benefit from the state scheme andfrom the new minimum requirements for occupational schemes.   Terms for contractirir^-out of the state scheme are as simple as they can be made, and the pensions whichoccupational schemes will provide will be at least as good as those of full member;?of the state scheme. \I -v:,        - ./        .        , :    ..... : - mmm :5.    The pension entitlement of the individual earner will build up each year.But we cannot wait 40 years and a full working life for mature benefits.   To do so would be   to neglect the needs of those in mid-career or beyond.   So the scheme will mature in 20 years.   Thereafter pensions will be based on the contributorsbest 20 years of earnings.   This is a completely new feature which will ensurejustice for manual and salaried workers alike.   It will help the younger workerand particularly one who is hit by unemployment, ill health or disablement.   Itwill enable women to draw the fullest advantage from their contributions during their working years.6. we are proposing to introduce earnings-related invalidity benefits which havebeen requested for so long by groups representing the disabled.7.For too long women have been treated as second class citizens in pension and benefit provision.   All women stand to gain under the new. scheme whether workinginside or outside.the home, whether single, married or widowed.   The working wifewill he assured of a decent pension  in her own right.   She can achieve a fullpension despite years spent away from paid employment while bringing up her family.Women looking after elderly relatives can similarly benefit.   The widow may inherit100% of her husband&apos;s pension entitlement and may add to this by her contributionsat work.   The older widower and the widower who has had to be supported by his wifebecause of prolonged sickness can inherit her pension rights.1
CONFIDENTIAL0.    We have - sought to make this scheme as simple as its social objectives allowand we have established a pension formula which is comprehensible both in termsof contributions and benefits.   You will see what I mean when you look at the tables in this White Paper.   The scheme also has the great merit of flexibilitywhich will enable successive governments to respond to the developing aspirations of future years./&quot;9. No pensions arrangements, however, could be remotely regarded as acceptableif they looked only to those retiring in the future and did little or nothing for the present generation of retirement pensioners whose interests must never be neglected or overlooked.   This Government has made a start with the payment ofpensions at the new higher levels and with the guarantee of increases in line withaverage earnings for the future - but that is only the beginning, not the end, ofthe job.   Our further proposals for helping existing pensioners, possibly throughthe tax system, will be available soon.^/*9. The new pension scheme should be seen as an extension of the policy underwhich existing pensions have been raised this summer to  10 for a single person and  16 for a married couple, with an undertaking that these basic pensions willbe uprated annually in line with earnings.   It is the basio pension whichiparticularly helps those with low incomes.   With the introduction of the new scheme the Government will therefore be reviewing the position of existingpensioners in the light of the development of the economy in the meanwhile andwith ^/&quot;special attention to those who have to rely mainly on their State pensionsJZ/&quot;a view to improving in particular the position of those who have to relymainly on their State pensionsJ7^/10.   The cost of the commitments in this White Paper has been very carefully considered in relation to the capacity of the country to support it.  Thedevelopment of adequate pensions such as we propose must, however, imply growingcost to be met by the rest of the community through contributions and taxation.The Government is confident that the country will be ready to pay that cost.11.   So I invite you to study this White Paper, confident that it fulfils the government&apos;s promise of security in retirement for all.
CHAPTER 1THE FUTURE SHAPE OP PENSIONS1.   For ten years successive Governments have considered plans for pensionsreform.   One element of the problem to he tackled has always been clear.   Thatis the failure of the present combination of a flat-rate national insurance pension, and of occupational pensions of sharply varying quality and limitedcoverage, to guarantee all old people more than a low standard of living or toprevent large numbers of them from having to rely on means-tested supplementary benefits.   Occupational pensions schemes have removed the threat of povertyin old age from a minority of pensioners, and offer the promise of adequatepensions to greater numbers in future; hut they are still far from universalin coverage, and their emphasis has mainly been on personal retirement pensionsrather than on contingencies such as ill-health or widowhood.2.   There is a second factor which has assumed enormously increased significancein recent years - inflation.   If people are now to face^ retirement withoutcontinual anxiety about money, they must have a guarantee that their pension will maintain its value.   Indeed so changed is the situation - even in the last threeyears - that the Government believes that no responsible political Party could come forward today with proposals for pension provision which did not includeguarantees against inflation - both on a person&apos;s pension rights before retirement,and on the pension paid afterwards.Dependence on supplementary benefit3.   Of about 8 million retirement pensioners, some 2 million - or about 25&apos;;;&quot;&quot;&apos;also receive a supplementary pension.   For widows over 60, who are the poorestgroup among the elderly, the proportion is 60jb.   In addition it is broadly  -estimated, that a further million old people would be entitled to some supplemen-tary pension, although ususally quite a small amount, if they claimed it.These figures reflect the paradox that the British social assistance!programme   ,is one of the hest in the world, while British contributory benefits havefallen behind those of most other advanced industrial nations.4.   It is wrong that such large numbers of pensioners should have to rely on supplementary benefit.   Such benefits are socially divisive.   Hen and womenunderstandably resent the fact that after a lifetime1s work and service in thecommunity they have to rely on means-tested supplementary benefits in order tokeep themselves out of poverty.   Further every claim for such benefits requiresdetailed personal investigation of the particular circumstances of an individual or family group.   This calls for a high degree of human sympathy and tact inenquiring into personal circumstances, and the staff of the supplementary benefits Commission cope well with this very difficult task - but it is not onewhich can be satisfactorily undertaken for massive numbers of people.   Therewill always be a few whose exceptional circumstances will   put them in need ofa &quot;safety net&quot; provision.   It is quite another matter when millions of peopleneed supplementary benefit after a normal working life.The present role of occupational pensions5.   For some people a reasonable income in old age is already guaranteed by their membership of an occupational pension scheme.   Such schemes are socially valuable and, as they represent an important element of personal savings and investment,economically important.   But for a number of reasons they do not - and cannot -cover the whole working population against all the contingencies for which long-term benefits are needed.   They provide benefits at widely varying levels,
ranging from pensions of two-thirds of final salary on retirement down to afew pence a week.   Although the best of them manage in practice to protect their pensions in payment against inflation, many fall far short of this.Coverage is far better for staff than for manual workers, and for men ascompared with women.   Though provision for widowhood is becoming commoner andhas been improved in recent years, many widows inherit less than a half of theirhusband&apos;6 pensions, and some get nothing at all.   Most occupational schemesdo not yet make adequate provision for the member forced into prematureretirement through ill-health.   The arrangements for the preservation ofpension rights when someone leaves a pensionable employment are still incomplete,so that, in general, an employee who divides his working life between a numberof jobs is less well provided for than one who stays with a single employer.But in so far as occupational pension schemes are set up voluntarily there isa limit beyond which the Government cannot go in compelling all schemes to conform to the standards of the best.   If the state wishes to make thosestandards universal,.it must take the lead through its own pension scheme.The Government&apos;s answer6.   The Government&apos;s first major decision on taking office was to raise the flat-rate national insurance pension of  7*75 for a single person and  12.50 for a married couple, set only 9 months earlier, to the present figures of  10 and 16, and to undertake that these new rates would maintain their relationship with general earnings levels.   This was an essential first step towards thenew pension scheme.[7.   The new soheme will be accompanied by further improvements in theprovisions for existing pensioners so as to raise the incomes of as many as possible above the supplementary benefit level.  A study is nowbeing made of the best way of doing this, possibly by creating forpensioners with lower incomes .a counterpart to the age exemptionprovisions of the tax system.] &apos;     &apos;8.   Future pensioners will qualify for higher pensions, under the Government&apos;snew scheme.   These will be earnings-related reflecting the fact that pensions are deferred pay.   For everyone with a complete contribution record, newpensions will begin at a base level to be set at the amount of the singleflat-rate pension in force when the scheme is introduced.   In 1974 terms thiswould be  10 a week.   Up to the base level, the new pension will represent a  for   replacement of earnings; on earnings above that level, it will provide in addition a quarter of earnings between the base level and an earningsceiling of seven times the base level,  70 a week in 1974 terms.   The pension will thus be earnings-related.   If, for example, a man with average industrialearnings had been contributing to the scheme for 20 years he would be entitledtoday to a pension of  17-75 single and  23-75 married.   If he had been at the top end of the earnings scale   these rates would be  25 and  31 respectively.In addition the married, pension would be increased in respect of any earningshis wife might have had.   (See Table B in chapter 2).   The combination of abase level and a further earnings-related return has the effect of weightingthe scheme in favour of the low paid.   It also has the advantage of flexibilitysince improvements in the base level pension will be incorporated automaticallyin the total pension.9.   Table A illustrates the full pensions which the new scheme will provide at different earnings levels.   The examples in the table and throughout this white Paper are necessarily in 1974 terms, but annual increases in the flat-rate pension will mean that the new scheme starts from a higher base level than  10, and that in cash terms its benefits will be correspondingly higherthan those shown here.

Full details of these new pensions are given in Chapter 2U   In particular they will:-&apos;(i) ensure that accruing rights to an adequate earnings-related pensionretain their relationship to earnings levels generally, and thatpensions awarded under the scheme are fully protected against inflation. &apos;   ,0&quot;&apos; /&apos;-) \ &quot; &apos; k    -A ; 7 0(ii) guarantee a woman the same pension as a man with the same earnings;   ^(iii) provide the first full pensions after 20 years, rather than after a working life-time of 45 years or more;(iv) cover death and long-term sickness by widowhood and invalidity pensionson the same terms as those for retirement; and(v) ensure that the recognition tests which have to be satisfied bycontracted-out schemes are such as to ensure adequate provision for themembers of those schemes, and for their widows.11.   The Government considered whether the Reserve Pension Scheme for which provision was made under the Social Security Act 1973 should be introduced ashad been planned by the previous administration, and later adapted to serve the objectives sat out in this White Paper.   This proved not to be practicable.It was inherent in the structure of the reserve pension scheme, which was based on money purchase principles, that older contributors should get a lower pension return for their contributions than younger contributors.   Thus   .older contributors could not be provided with an adequate pension except by imposing contribution rates which would be wholly excessive, and this would-not be acceptable in a state scheme.   Nor could a money purchase scheme provideany guaranteed protection against inflation for the pensions put into paymentunder it.   In these circumstances the Reserve Pension Scheme, if introduced,would have been merely a temporary expedient designed to operate only untilthe Government&apos;s own plans could be brought into effect.5
CONFIDENTIAL&apos;12.   The Government decided that, from the social standpoint, the ReservePension Scheme was not of sufficient value to justify requiring employees and their employers to contribute to it.   It was also clear that theinterests of those concerned with occupational schemes would be betterserved by not introducing the reserve scheme.   To have done so would havemeant a period of great administrative confusion, as the present contracting out arrangements were replaced first by those associated With the ReservePension Scheme, and then by those appropriate to the Government&apos;s own pensionsplans.   There were however other features of the 1973 legislation - notably the replacement of the present flat-rate and graduated contributions by a fullyearnings-related contributions structure - which were wholly acceptable to theGovernment.   These are to come into force, as planned, in April 1975,13.   The Government&apos;s proposals follow.   They aim at providing adequate income for all during retirement, widowhood and invalidity with a minimum of disturbancefor good occupational schemes.   The Government are confident that, when theseproposals are considered, they will be generally Welcomed by those who share the common concern for better pensions and that it will be possible to proceed,through early legislation, to a speedy implementation of them.6
CHAPTER 2THE HEW SCHEME14.     It is a vital element of the Scheme that the pension rightsbuilt up and payable under it are fully protected against inflation.A major defect of the present graduated scheme is that it does notI offer such protection.   The last administration&apos;s proposed ReservePension Scheme could not have guaranteed it.   Under the new scheme the pensions payable during retirement, widowhood and invalidity willbe earnings-related.   Their accruing value during working life willbe maintained by the revaluation of contributors&apos; past earnings in line with the growth in earnings generally.   Thus the amount earned in any year by an average earner will be revalued so that it representsaverage earnings in the year in which he retires.   Once a pension  hasbeen awarded the base level element will be increased so as to maintain its relationship with current earnings levels, and the remainder will receiveless than price protection.    Price-protection will also extend underthe new scheme to graduated pensions that are already in payment andto the rights which have been built up under the existing graduated pensions scheme.Retirement Pension(i) The Pension Formula15.    A similar pension will be available under the new scheme for menand women contributors alike.   It will be based on the earnings onwhich contributions have been paid in the individuals best 20 years.It will represent  1 for every  1 of weekly earnings up to a base level,and a quarter of the earnings between the base level and a ceiling.   the base level will be set at the amount of the single flat-rate pension inforce when the scheme is introduced and the ceiling will be seven timesthat amount.   This means, in 1974 terms, a base level of  10 a week anda ceiling of  70,   These figures are used throu$out this White paper for illustrative purposes.   No full contributor, however low his earnings,will get less than the base level pension of  10, which will be thescheme&apos;s basic minimum.16.    Examples of entitlement when the scheme is fully mature have alreadybeen given in Table A in Chapter 1, which shows the position where the wife has not been working.   Table B illustrates the full pensions payablewhere both the husband and the wife have contributed where one has the earnings set out in the first column and the other has those in thesecond:-/-   A

Pensions at the levels quoted in tables A and B will be awarded after thescheme has been in operation for 20 years.   Progress towards the new scheme rates will be made year by year.   For each year of the new scheme a contributor will get \1% of his earnings between the base level and the ceiling until those whohave contributed for 20 years qualify for the full 2$%.   As regards pension on earnings up to the base level, entitlement under the new scheme will combine withearlier records of contributions so as to produce the  10 pension for the fullypaid-up contributor.   Tables C and D give examples of pensions during thematurity period.   These tables, like Table A, assume that the pensions for a married couple are derived from the husband&apos;s contributions alone.//&quot;

CONFIDENTIAL -(iii) Pensions for Married Couples18.    A married pensioner   who has a wife under 60 will continue to beentitled to an increase of his pension for her, and the pension willbecome hers when she reaches 60.   At present the rate of this pension is  6 and tables C and D assume that It is in payment.   Where a married woman has contributed under the new scheme she will receive either the 6 or her own base level entitlement, whichever is the higher.   But inany case her pension on earnings above the base level will be payable in addition.(iv) 20 Best Years19.    Calculating the pension on the best 20 years will improve pension rates by allowing moderate or poor years to be left out of account.However it is not intended that people who have only 20 years1 contribu-tions or not many more should do as well or better than those who belong to the scheme for a life time.   Full benefit will depend on keeping upmembership of the scheme in four fifths of the possible years.   Pensionswill be reduced where scheme membership has been maintained in fewer yearsthan this.   However this rule will not affect the pension rights of people who are unemployed or sick - and credited with earnings - or people whoremain at home to look after children or sick or elderly dependants (seeparagraph 43),(v) Pension Age and Increments20.   The present pensionable ages of      for men and 60 for women willbe retained, because of the cost that would be involved both for the economy and the scheme in lowering the pension age forjnen./^ This cannot have priority over the needs of existing pensioners./The retirement condition and earnings rule will remain but the level at which the earnings ruleaffects pension will continue to be reviewed regularly.   Anyone whodefers retirement beyond normal pension age will increase his pensionby (fy/o for each year it is forgone.   Contributions will cease to be payable by people who remain at work after pension age, though their employers will continue to pay.(vi) The Contracted Out21.    Members of contracted-out occupational pension schemes, who will pay a reduced rate of contribution (see paragraph 37), will rely on their occupational schemes for a part of their retirement pension entitlement.The Governments proposals are described in more detail in Chapter 3.Widow&apos;s Pension(i)    The Pension FormulaIf22.    The widow s full pension and the personal rate of widowed mother&apos;allowance are at present at the flat-rate of  10.   Under the new schemethey will be replaced by earnings-related pensions.   These will comprisethe whole of the single rate of retirement pension which the husband was receiving or had earned at his death.   Where the husband dies before reaching retirement age his rate of pension will be calculated on thebasis of his earnings in his best 20 years.   If he has contributed forfewer than 20 years, earnings will be credited to him at the base levelin the years required to make up 20.
(ii) Widows under 60---23.    The pensions described in the last paragraph will become payableafter six months of widowhood: during that first period of widowhood awidow1 s allowance, including an earnings-related supplement will as nowbe payable at a preferential rate.   When widow&apos;s allowance ceases, thefull pension will be available to a widowed mother or to women who are over 50 when widowed or when their children grow up.   lounger, childlesswidows will receive smaller earnings-related pensions, reduced accordinglib their age at widowhood.; v..f v:&quot;; V:        &apos; V/ vVv.&apos;&apos;  7 &apos;       //M&apos;-;M       -p&apos; :-.&apos;::--X!&apos;-&apos;-: X^i^-iK^-iX&apos;^.;-.(iii) Retirement Pension for Widows !lV, \ &apos; .--y:-y&apos;:7 ::^yX[ &apos;yyyy-y:\y^-:&apos;&apos;yy &apos;::;.y[:&apos;:y/-.24.    Prom age 60, or on retirement if this is later, a widow - irrespective of her age at widowhood - will be able to add 2$% of her own earnings abovethe base level to the pension she draws on her husband^ record, subject tothe limitation that her total pension may not exceed the maximum payable on one record.   Table E shows the full pensions which will result from thisproposal.TABLE ERETIREMENT PENSION PAYABLE TO A WIDOWHer averageearningsLate husband&apos;saverageearningsFull pension on hisearningsAddition on her earningsTotalretirementpension   1020304050(immaterial)20203040607012.5012.5015.0017.5022.5025.00nil2.505.007.5O2.5Qnil12.5015.0020.0025.0025.0025.00MaximumiMaximum, Maximum(iv)    The Maturity Period25.    The attainment of full pension under the scheme will build up stepby step during the first 20 years, as described in paragraph 17.   Themaximum pension available to a widow who derives her retirement pensionpartly from her husband&apos;s earnings and partly from her own, as illustratedin Table E, will similarly increase to the full  25 over the course of thematurity period.(v)The Contracted-Out26.    Members of contracted-out occupational pension schemes who will payable reduced level of contributions (see paragraph 37) will rely on their occupational pension schemes for a part of their widowhood cover.   The(k)vernment&apos;s proposals are described in more detail in Chapter 3*
27.     An important new feature of the scheme is the recognition of the financialneeds of widowers.   A man over 65 when his wife dies will have his retirement pension recalculated on the same basis as the retirement pension his widow wouldhave got if he had died first - see table E.    For example, if a husband.has apension of  15 including  5 related to earnings above the base level and his wife has a pension of  13 including  3 related to earnings above the base level,the survivor will receive a pension of  18, whether it is the husband or the wife.28.     The scheme also recognises the needs of a widower under retirement age who,has been dependent on Ms wife&apos;s earnings.   Where such a man is ill at the tineof his wife&apos;s death he will have a new right to an invalidity pension calculated on the basis of her earnings record if it is better than his own.Invalidity Pensions(i) The Pension Formula29.     The existing invalidity pension is at a flat-rate.     This will be replaced by a benefit equivalent to the retirement pension earned by the claimant&apos;s pastrecord of earnings.    As with retirement pension and widow&apos;s pension this will comprise a base level pension plus a quarter of earnings between the base leveland the ceiling.     Where the claimant has not contributed for 20 years, earningswill be credited at the base level in the years required to make up 20.    Thisprovision is the same as for the widow&apos;s benefit.30.   Invalidity allowance is an addition to invalidity pension and depends on theage at which the claimant becomes sick.   At present it is payable at three ratesdepending on whether his incapacity begins before age 35* age 45, or before age 55for women or (0 for men.   It is proposed to ease these age conditions so thatthe highest rate will normally be available to anyone who falls sick beforehaving built up a record of 20 years of earnings.   This rate will become payable for incapacity starting before age 40 and the intermediate rate will correspondingcover incapacity beginning before age 50.(ii) The Maturity Period51.     Full pensions will become payable once the scheme has been in operation for20 years.     Until then progress towards the full rates will be made year by year as shown in paragraph 17./it
financeh   on the assumptions stated in his report, which ie attaohed to this &quot;White Paper,the Government Actuary estimates that a combined contribution from employers and employees of not more than 16^ of employees8 earnings up to the scheme&apos;e ceiling wouldbe required to finance the scheme in its early years if 8 million employeesvere contracted out.  This contribution would compare with the 14$ combinedcontribution proposed for April 1975 under the Social Security Amendment Billsow before Parliament.   It covers all national insurance benefits, industrial injuries benefits, a contribution to the National Health Service, and theemployer1 s contribution to the redundancy fund.33,  The balance between the scheme&apos;s income and expenditure will be affectedby the number of occupational scheme members who are contracted out.   Forexample, a contribution of not more than 16% would be needed in the early yearsif the number contracted out turned out to be ^/million, rather than 8 million.In either case, the rate would need to be increased by up to tyb within 10 to15 years, and would reach about Id^d in 30 years.34.  It is not necessary to decide the initial contribution rate firmly atMs point.   This will depend on various factors, which will need to be re-appraised nearer the time. But, for the present, it is thought right to illustrate the effects of the scheme by assuming- an initial contribution of16$ and the figures shown in the text of this white Paper are on that basis.   Of a 16-1$ contribution the employee would pay 6jj$ and the employer1$.IsBejMS-,&apos;-,:.&quot; . I - ::&apos;:\\(i)  employees  Contributions35.  For employees who earn more than the base level, contributions will be payable on all earnings up to a ceiling, which will be set at seven times, the base level - roughly 1^- times average male industrial earnings.   In 1974 terms,the base level and ceiling would be  10 and  70 a week respectively.   Thoseemployees who earn less than the base level will continue to be covered for thebenefits of the industrial injuries scheme and they will be able to contributevoluntarily to maintain pension entitlement at the base level.36.  Employees with earnings above the base level of  10 a week will paydifferent rates of contributions depending- on whether or not they are members ofoontracted-out occupational schemes (see Chapter 3 below).   Those who are not members of such schemes will contribute 6%fa of all their earnings up to the ceiling.  Employees contracted-out in approved occupational pension schemes will contribute at the 6%% rate on earnings up to the base level, and at a lower rate on earnings between the base level and the ceiling to take account of 1the fact that their occTipational pension schemes will be providing a partof their pensions which would otherwise be provided by the state scheme.In paragraph 66 it is suggested that the^appropriate reduction would initiallylie between 6% and T/o of &quot;the employee&apos; s ,/reckonable earnings.   For illustra-tive purposes it is assumed that the reduction would be divided between theemployer13CONFIDENTIAL
awl employee so that the employee is relieved of 2Jf/&amp; - and the employer of the&quot;balance.   In that event the full 6^% contribution would come down, on earnings above the base level, to 496.37.   Table F gives examples, in 1974 terms, of the contributions which would be payable at various earnings levels compared with the contributions proposed inthe Social Security Amendment Bill to come into force next April.TABLE F		New Scheme	Weekly Earnings	April 1975	Not Contracted out   1	Contracted out 			 15 30 45 70 ( 69 maximum at April 1975)	0.83 1.65 2.48 3.79	0.98 1.95 2.93 4 .55	0.85 1.45 2.05 3.05
(ii)   Employers1 Contributions39.    The pattern of contributions payable by employers will follow that of employees but will be set approximately 50 per cent higher.   Thus an employerwhose employees are fully within the state scheme will contribute 10 per cent of their earnings up to the ceiling.    For contracted-out employees an employer,on the assumptions in paragraph 36,would, pay   10 per cent on earnings up to the base level and 6 per cent on earnings between the base level and the ceiling.Table G illustrates the contributions payable for employees at different earningslevels, and compares them with those applying from April 1975.TABLE Gweekly	April	National Superannuation	Earnings	1975	Not Contracted out	Contracted out 	 	 	 15	1.28	1.50	1.3030  ,	2.55	3.00	2.20 .45	3.83	4.50	3.1070	5.86	7.00	4.60( 69 maximum			at April 1975)			(iii)   Treasury supplement39.    The contribution from general taxation to the existing national insurancescheme amounts to about 18 per cent of the total contributions paid by insuredpersons and employers.    The same proportion will be continued for the new scheme,but it will be based on the contribution income, which the National Insurance fund would receive if contracted-out employees and their employers paid full contri-butions.     This, together with the increase in the percentage rates of contributionsas compared with those that are proposed from next April, means that Treasurysupport of the scheme will be substantially increased.   In 1978-79 it will be 1,110 million compared with the  865 million which would otherwise have been paid under the Social Security Amendment Bill.15
(iv)   The, Self-Employed(iv)   The Self-EmployedAO.     Self-employed people will pay a flat-rate contribution of  2.41 a week in1974 terms, those with low earnings being excepted from compulsory payment, asthev are now.   In return they will receive pension at the base level.   those with profits or gains exceeding  ?0 a week in 1974 terms (3 times the base level)will in addition pay an earnings-related contribution of 8% on the excess up tothe  70 ceiling.   This w&amp;Ll spread the cost of self-employed peopled benefitsmore fairly and will avoid the need for a substantially higher flat-rate contribution, which would cause hardship to those with lower earnings.(v)    The Non-Employed41.&apos;  Prom April 1975 compulsory contribution liability will cease for people whose earnings are below a threshold level.   This arrangement will be carried forward into the new scheme, where earnings below the base level will not carry contribution liability.   However, low earners and the non-employed willbe entitled to pay voluntary contributions of  1 .90   a week in 1974 terms ifthey so wish, in order to maintain title to pension at the base level.   Suchoontributions may also be paid by those who wish to repair gaps in their contribution record.Membership of the scheme?.   As indicated in paragraph 19 pension entitlement will depend in part ona ^contributor maintaining membership of the scheme.   Membership will bemaintained primarily by the payment of contributions as an employee or as a self-employed or non-employed contributor, or by receipt of widow!s orinvalidity pension or of short-term benefit.   People who qualify for any suchpensions or benefits will be credited with earnings to the extent-necessary tobring their records up to the base level.43.   Membership of the scheme will continue, without any requirement to pay contributions, for a person who is looking after children or caring at home for an adult receiving an invalidity or retirement pension or an attendance allowance.   This provision will help those concerned to satisfy the four-fifthstest described in paragraph 19*   It will be of particular value to the married woman or single parent who remains at home while her children are growing up,as well as single women and others who are obliged to cut short their careersin order to look after aged relatives.Married Women and Widows ,44.   The scheme will provide comparable treatment for men and women and inparticular will involve the following changes:-/(i;    Men and women with the same earnings will receive the same pensions.Every year of contribution under the new scheme will ensure, even for married women who have previously been &quot;opted out&quot;, some additionalpension.16
(ii)   The half-test, under which married women who have not paidcontributions in half the total of weeks between marriage and pension age lose their title to pension on their own records,will cease to operate.Married women who are entitled to sickness or unemploymentbenefit will receive it at the full rate.   The discriminatorylower rate for them will cease.Pension rights will be protected during periods spent at homelooking after children or the old or sick.(v) Widowed mothers and most widows will inherit the whole of the earnings-related retirement pensions which their husbands have earned..(vi) A retired widow will be able to derive pension from both her latehusband&apos;s earnings and her own. (A parallel provision will applyto men who become widowers in retirement). n&apos;.&apos;:,&apos;.-;&apos;;-v.W&apos; . -v ,;X *    &quot;  &quot;&apos;      &apos; -&apos;ighe contribution optioniij, The Government are not prepared to perpetuate a system under whichsarried women and some widows who go out to work have a choice between paying fu]contributions for inferior benefits or paying at a reduced irate which confersno benefit rights at all except for industrial injuries.   In a scheme which provides earnings-related benefits in ret\irn for earnings-relatedI contributions working men and women should contribute on exactly the samelasis whether they are single or married.   The existing married women&apos;1!?option should therefore be abolished but the Government recognise that, for large numbers of working wives who have opted out of full contributions underthe present scheme, the complete and abrupt withdrawal of their right to payat the reduced rate would cause a sharp reduction in their pay.   The questiontherefore is how to bring about equality in the new scheme in such a way thatit serves the best interests of the present and the future generations ofsarried women and the community as a whole.46.  It is proposed that new entrants to the scheme should no longer have theright to opt out of paying full contributions and thereby deprive themselves of the valuable new benefit rights which are being made available to them.At the same time they will be able to qualify for the same rates of sickness and unemployment benefit as men and single women with the same earnings, andat pension age they will not be subject to the &quot;half-test&quot; which restrictsthe entitlement of married women to a retirement pension on their owncontributions. m.      ,   &apos; &apos; . -4?.  For the present generation of working wives the Government will initiatediscussions with organisations representing employers and workers and with other interested organisations as to the best way of phasing out theexisting system.   For them also, reduced rates of unemployment and sickness1 confidential
&quot;benefit and the half-test at age 60 will go.   But the Government willalso want to examine the possibility that working wives should retain their right to opt out of cover for short-term benefits while coming fully intothe scheme for retirement pensions and invalidity benefit.   If, in thelight of these discussions, this turns out to be a generally acceptable andworkable proposition theGovernment will consider making this limitedoption available to all working wives.48.   No final decision has therefore been reached, but for illustrativepurposes the scheme has been costed on the basis that married women who go out to work will be fully covered for long-term benefits but that therewill continue to be an option for short-term benefits. Table H shows,on theassumption that a married woman who did not seek cover for short-term benefits would have her contribution reduced by 1f?6, how her contribution would compare with those payable by opted-out women from April 19 75.TABLE HWeeklyearningsApril1975New schemeNot contracted-otitContracted-out   3045700.901.400.300.600.711.432.143.320.580.931.261 .82It18
I CHAPTER 3I PARTNERSHIP WITH OCCUPATIONAL PENSION SCHEMES49.   A crucial factor in determining the future pattern of pension provision isthe existence in this country of thriving occupational pensions.   occupational schemes provide their members with additional income in retirement, generallyrelated to earnings - including earnings in the hi^ier ranges which state provisiondoes not cover.   They may also be geared to the needs of, and agreements in,particular industries or occupations.   For example, they may provide for retire-ment at an earlier age than does the state scheme.,, And they make a valuableI contribution to the economy through their encouragement of private saving by whichemployees put aside some of their current pay to provide for retirement.I 50.   The Government Actuary&apos;s fourth report^ 011 occupational pension schemesestimated that in 1971 about 2-jjs- million retired people and    million widows andother dependants were drawing occupational pensions.   At the same time, some 11million of the working population were members of occupational schemes;   and thelatest figures suggest that cover for an occupational pension is enjoyed by about one-half of the working population, including two-thirds of employed men, butonly one-third of employed women. An increasing number of members are likely to retire with an occupational pension equal to half pay: some will have a lump Assuming addition, and the best schemes provide a widow with a half-rate pension.51.   On ,the other hand the benefits in many cases are very modest.   Although theaverage occupational pension in payment in 1972 was over  6 a week, about 30%of the pensioners received less than  2 a week.   Moreover there are gaps andweaknesses in the system.   One of the most serious is the virtual absence, outBidethe public sector, of any guarantee of inflation-proofing after award, even in good final salary schemes.   The reason for this is clear enough, but the problemremains.   Some schemes do not provide any cover for widowhood at all and manyschemes do not provide a pension for widows whose husbands have died before reaching retirement age.   Looking at schemes as a whole, they tend to cater more for men than for women and more for staff than for manual workers.52.   This inferior position of manual workers is a particularly striking feature of occupational pension provision.    In 1971 * despite the trend towards pensionsbased on final salary, most of the 2jt million members of manual workers&apos; schemes were in schemes offering a flat rate pension for each year of membership, andthe amount of pension earned each year was usually less than lOp. per week - apension of less than  2 after 20 years1 service.   For salaried staff, on the otherhand, flat rate schemes were almost unknown.   Even final salary schemes formanual workers tend to provide pensions which represent a smaller proportion of earnings than do similar schemes for salaried workers.53.   It has been a common feature of the pension plans of previous administra-tions that they have recognised the ^yalue of occupational pension schemes andsought to devise arrangements under which such schemes would share with thestate the responsibility of making provision for old age.   These arrangements have attempted to accommodate the kind of occupational pension schemes under whichpension rights are built up in fixed money terms, ignoring changes in the valueof money and the higher levels of earnings applying when the pension came tobe paid.   Such schemes are of little use in a period of inflation and cannoteasily be fitted into the framework of a state scheme under which pension levelshave to be judged against the living standards current at the time when thepensions are in payment.Nupational pension schemes 1971s   Fourth survey by the Government Actuary, HMSO.   -   -   .   19L: CONFIDENTIAL
54.   Successive Governments have tried various ways of resolving the problem.The National Insurance Act 1959 provided that a part of the state scheme should operate in fixed money terms, so that very modest occupational schemes couldcontract out of it fully.   The result of this is that the value of pensionunits earned in 1961,&apos; the first year of the state graduated scheme, has nowfallen, by 50%* and it has become a matter of urgency to revalue them (seeparagraph 14).   The National Superannuation and Social Insurance Bill 1969 choseinstead a system of partial contracting out or &quot;abatement&quot;, under whichoccupational pension schemes had to provide a pension calculated in fixed money terms and this would have been deducted from a state pension fully protected against inflation.   Such an arrangement, under which the- state and occupational pensions were calculated on entirely different bases, was however criticised bysome commentators as both complex and artificial.   The Social Security Act 1973was more akin to the 1959 Act, with the effect that the limitations of modestoccupational schemes were to be imposed upon the Reserve Pension Scheme.55.   If occupational pension schemes had not developed beyond such restrictedlevels, and all that was at issue was the need to bring schemes of this character into partnership with the state provision, the right answer wouldprobably be to abandon the attempt to devise a satisfactory basis for contracting out and to encourage employers to supplement their employees&apos; state pensionsthrough private provision.   This is the pattern of pension provision mostcommonly found in European countries.   Such a system, which did not aim at anyintegration between state and occupational pensions, would have the advantage ofsimplicity.   It would avoid the risk that improvements in the state scheme mighthave to be ruled out because they could not be matched by the private sector,and would mean that such requirements as Governments decided to lay on occupational schemes in general would not have to be supplemented by a further set of rules for those which sought to contract out.   In recent years, however, an increasing number of occupational schemes have adopted a &quot;final salary&quot; basis - reckoningtheir members&apos; pensions by reference to the salary or wage earned over a short period prior to retirement.   Between 1963 and 1971 the proportion of privatesep-tor schemes which adopted this basis rose from one in eight to nearly one&apos;intwo&apos;,&quot;&apos;&apos;and by 1971 62% of private scheme members, as well as almost all of those inthe public sector, were covered by such schemes.56.   Of the 8 million who were members of final salary schemes in 1971 over7^ million were earning pensions of at least one-eightieth of salary each year.Even allowing for the fact that not all salary may be pensionable, many of themstand to retire on at least half-pay after 40 years&apos; service with one employer.Both in terms of quality and quantity, therefore, such schemes now take the lead in occupational pension provision, and this makes possible a new and muchmore   worthwhile kind of partnership in which state and occupational schemescan combine in a simple and logical way to provide for the first time a totalpension that is adequate, dependable and fully protected against inflation.!In future, all employees, throughout their working life, will build up entitle-ment to an adequate pension based on their earnings.   Some will do this entirelythrough the state scheme;   others by a combination of state and occupationalprovision. iConditions for contracting-out57.   It will therefore be open to occupational schemes, on the terms described below, to contract their members out of a part of the state cover and instead to enter into partnership with the state in providing pensions for them.   Itis proposed that members of contracted-out schemes and their employers will pay
-    .     confidential the full state contribution on earnings up to the base level, and that they willbe fully covered for personal pension at that level from the state scheme.   on earnings between the base level and the state schemed ceiling, they and their employers will pay a reduced contribution and in return they will retain fullooverage under the state scheme for short term benefits and invalidity pension,and half coverage for earnings related widow s pensions (see paragraph 61).   Theywill earn no personal retirement pension on this band of earnings in the state scheme.   Instead a comparable or higher pension will be provided by the contracted-out scheme and there will be special arrangements, which will be very valuable tothe employee, for protecting the guaranteed minimum pension (see next paragraph)against inflation.58.!I The Government propose that an occupational pension scheme, if it is to contract out, will have to satisfy two main conditions in the provision of personal pensions.   First, a scheme will have to provide a pension based on finalsalary or average salary revalued in line with the growth in earnings generally,with an annual accrual rate equivalent to at least one-eightieth of pensionablesalary, that is remuneration counted for pension by the scheme in question.   Anaccrual rate of eightieths corresponds to the li% a year at which, as indicatedin paragrap h 17, state pension will build up on earnings above the base levelduring the new scheme&apos;s first 20 years.   It is also, as paragraph 56 mentions,a formula which is already commonly provided (or bettered) by final salary schemes.Schemes will be allowed to provide for accrual to cease after a member had completed 40 years1 service.   Second, a contracted-out scheme will be requiredto provide a total pension which will be at least as much as the state scheme would pay on the member&apos;s actual gross pay between the base level and the ceilingif the calculation were made over the member&apos;s lifetime earnings in the scheme.This amount, which will be referred to as the guaranteed minimum pension, wouldbe in practice the pension for which contracted-out schemes would take over responsibility from the state.   After retirement its value will, as paragraph 64describes, be guaranteed by the state.59.   The need for a &quot;minimum benefit rule&quot; of this kind arises because the calculation of pension entitlement from a contracted-out scheme will notnecessarily follow that proposed for the state scheme.   In the first place, manyoccupational pension schemes, unlike the state scheme, do not base their pensionson gross pay but on a lesser figure, which may exclude earnings from suchsources as bonuses and overtime.   Secondly, a scheme member&apos;s career pattern may,in some cases, mean that a pension based on final salary is not as favourable as one based upon earnings revalued in line with the growth in earnings levelsgenerally, as the new state pensions will be.   To meet this point, the minimumbenefit rule will, where necessary, override a scheme&apos;s ordinary rules so as toprovide the guaranteed minimum pension.60.   The minimum benefit rule will not however take account of the &quot;best 20 years&quot;formula (see paragraph   19) that will be used in calculating pensions in thestate scheme.   This is because there would be considerable practical difficultyin apportioning between schemes the responsibility for a minimum pensioncalculated on the &quot;best 20 years&quot; formula where more than one scheme was involved;and such a  Simula could only become/effective after 20 years, at a time whenpension in contracting-out schemes would, unlike that in the state scheme,continue to accrue at eightieths or better.   The amount of guaranteed minimumpension due to each scheme member will be notified to schemes in each case bythe Department of Health and Social Security.   It is also envisaged that therewill be arrangements whereby contracted-out schemes could be supplied with information about the current level of guaranteed minimum pension for particularscheme members before pension age.21&quot;
Cover for widowhood61.   The Government propose that a contracted-out scheme will be required toprovide a widow&apos;s pension at half the rate of the husband&apos;s personal pension.This means that a contracted-out scheme will have to provide a widow&apos;s pensionbased on final salary or average salary revalued, with an annual accrual rateequivalent to at least one one-hundred-and-sixtieth of pensionable salary.   it also means that a contracted-out scheme will be required to provide a widow&apos;pension which was at least half the amount of the husband*s guaranteed Mnimumpension at the time of his death.   The effect of this proposal Will be thatcontracted-out schemes will provide half the proposed rate of widow&apos;s pension onupper band earnings;   the other half will remain to be paid by the state scheme.This division of responsibility is proposed partly because it is consistent withthe present level of widowhood provision in good occupational schemes, but also because it makes possible a degree of flexibility in the type of benefit to beprovided.   In certain cases it will be open to occupational schemes to pay the death benefit to another dependant, where the circumstances seem to justify thiBcourse. . ,  .
62.   It has been a common practice amongst occupational pension schemes,particularly in respect of death in service benefits, to provide forwidowhood by means of lump sum cover rather than pension cover.   Whilstin general the Government consider that it is better for pensions ratherthan lump sum payments to be provided, they are ready to examine thepossibility of lump sum payments being accepted as an alternative towidow1s pensions in some circumstances.   The Government would welcome views,therefore, on whether lump sum payments should be accepted as an alternative to the provision of a widow&apos;s pension on the basis set out in paragraph 61and, if that alternative is recommended, on the circumstances in which itshould be permitted.Increments for deferred retirement63.   Where the drawing of the state pension is deferred beyond the normalretirement age of 65 (men) or 60 (women) it is proposed that incrementsshould be paid in recognition of the pension forgone in the form of a givenincrease of pension entitlement for each year of deferment.   To ensure thatcontracted out employees will be no worse off if they work beyond retirementage, contracted-out schemes will be required to make provision on asimilar basis.Protecting the pension against inflation64.   In the state scheme that part of the pension based upon earnings betweenthe base level and the ceiling will, as indicated in paragraph 14, receive no less than price protection.   At present only occupational schemes in thembliisector guarantee price protection although it is also achieved in practice by certain schemes in the private sector.   In these circumstances theGovernment have thought it right not to require contracted-out schemes to guarantee to provide any increase in pensions after award.   Instead thestate scheme will provide for the guaranteed minimum pension (seepar^Taph 58) to go up by no less than any increase in prices.   An alternatiV&apos;would have been to require schemes to provide a. fixed ineasxire of post-awardincrease, which can be insured against, and for the balance to be paid bythe state scheme.   In the Government&apos;s view a mixed arrangement of this kind would have been unnecessarily complex.65.   A problem arises as to how the increases mentioned above should be paidto the pensioner.   One way would be for the increase to be paid direct tothe pensioner as part of the state scheme pension.   The alternative wouldbe to pay the increase through contracted-out schemes as part of the occupational pension.   In that case the Government would have to besatisfied that satisfactory administrative arrangements could be made.It is reasonable to assume that such arrangements would involve some government supervision of the administration of contracted-out schemes.Subject to this, the payment of the increases through the occupational scheme has muoh to commend it, but the Government would welcome the viewsof those concerned with occupational pension schemes on this point.Contribution reduction66.   Members of occupational pension schemes who are contracted out will payable lower contribution to the state scheme on that account, as will their employers.   The contribution reduction will reflect the cost of providingthrough the occupational scheme the pension forgone under the state scheme.The amount of pension forgone in the state scheme for each year of service will vary according to the age of the employee at the start of the scheme;23
this is because the state scheme provides a higher rate of build-up in the initial years so as to enable full pensions to be paid to those who retireafter 20 years in the scheme.   It follows that the average cost of providing the pension forgone in the state scheme will fall over the years and so will the contribution reduction for contracted-out employees.   The adjustment inthe level of contribution reduction might conveniently be made at 5-yearly intervals.   On each occasion that the contribution reduction is assessedthe aim will be to set the reduction at a level which fairly reflects thecost of providing in a typical occupational scheme the pension forcontracted-out members which they would otherwise have received from thestate scheme.   This will involve striking an average cost as betweenemployees of different ages. and. in conformity with their policy of moving towards pension arrangements which are the same for men and women,the Government propose that the same contribution reduction should apply for both male and female employees.   Preliminary calculations by theGovernment Actuary suggest that the reduction might lie initially between % and T/c of the employee * s earnings between the base .level and the ceiling.   A more detailed assessment will be needed beforethe initial amount is finally settled, but for purposes of illustrationa reduction of        is assumed in this White Paper.Preservation of pension entitlement67.   Special provision will be needed to safeguard the pension entitlement of people who leave contracted-out schemes or who are members of schemes whichcease to be contracted out.   At present there is no requirement that thevalue of their pensions should be maintained until they are put into payment.A crucial weakness of &quot;final salary&quot; schemes is the fact that, when pension rights are preserved for an employee leaving before retirement age, they are based on his earnings at the time of leaving, which may be far below generallevels of earnings by the time he retires.   Some schemes provide for increases in preserved pensions but, except in the public sector, such increases are seldom more than a small fixed percentage, falling far short of increases in earnings and prices.  This could well be a bar to the mobility of members of contracted-out schemes.   Members of the state scheme will have their earnings revalued in line with the general movement of earnings no matter how many times they move from one firm to another.Clearly similar provision is needed for people in contracted-out schemeswho leave early.   Contracted-out schemes will, therefore, be required toensure that the amount of a preserved pension is no less than it would havebeen if the person had been in the state scheme for the same period, and the calculation had been made on his lifetime earnings in the scheme.Buying back employees into the state scheme68.   Where members leave a contracted-out scheme after only a short period,or where a scheme itself ceases to contract out, there will be arrangementsfor the scheme to reinstate - or &quot;buy back&quot; - members into full statepension entitlement.   The extent to which such a &quot;buy back&quot; facilityshould be available, and the basis on which it should be costed, will be amatter on which the Government will be consulting occupational pensioninterests.   But it is important to emphasise that this facility is seen by the Government as playing only a limited role.   It will not form a major part of the new arrangements but will be designed only to safeguard theposition of members of schemes which cease to be contracted-out schemes and of members who leave schemes after short service.
Supervision of contracting-out arrangements69.   When a satisfactory basis has been settled for the relationship betweencontracted-out schemes and the state, it will be necessary for the ensuingarrangements to be supervised.   The Government intend that the task of deciding whether an occupational scheme should be accepted as a contracted-out scheme, and of ensuring that a contracted-out scheme has adequatefinancial backing, should be the responsibility of the occupational pensions Board, which was set up under the Social Security Act 1973 withI certain responsibilities for occupational schemes.Clearing house arrangements70.   The Government also see a need to examine the extent to which it maybe necessary to set up &quot;clearing house&quot; arrangements of some kind forpreserved pensions.   This raises some difficult problems, and before coming to any definite conclusions the Government will wish to consult those concerned with occupational pension schemes.Summary71.   The previous paragraphs have outlined a system of contracting outwhich should make it possible for good occupational pension schemes tocontinue to make provision for their members in partnership with the state scheme, and with the minimum disruption to themselves.   They will berequired to provide an annual accrual rate equivalent to at least one-eightiethof pensionable salary and to provide a total pension (the guaranteedminimum pension) at age 65 for men and 60 for women&apos; which was at least as much as the state scheme would have paid on the member&apos;s actual grosspay between the base level and the ceiling.   After retirement, the state would ensure that the guaranteed minimum pension was uprated in line with prices.   Working out such an arrangement will inevitably involvethe study of many technical details, and the Government are anxiousto enter into early consultation on these.   But they are satisfied that,with goodwill on all sides, solutions can be found to any problems arising from the proposed arrangements in time for the necessary legislation to be introduced at an early date.Public sector schemes72.   Of the 11 million who are members of occupational pension schemes some4 million are employed in the public sector, composed mainly of civilservants, teachers, firemen, police, staff of local authorities and national health Service, and employees of nationalised industries.   Where theGovernment are the employer there will be full discussion withrepresentatives of the staff, but, in general, the Government are confident that public sector schemes can satisfy the conditions for contracting out of the state scheme and that those conditions wouldprovide a reasonable basis for such schemes to contract out.25.COMPgDENTIAL
CHAPTER 4IMPROVING OCCUPATIONAL PENSION SCHEMES GENERALLY ,7%   The White Paper has already referred to the role of occupational pension schemes in the Government&apos;s proposed pension arrangements.   Chapter 3 dealtspecifically with the proposals for occupational schemes which contract out of theState scheme to form an integrated partnership with the State scheme in totalpension provision.   This chapter deals with certain questions affecting all* occupational schemes, whether or not they are contracted-out.Equal Status for Women74-   The Government are committed to the principle that women should have a fairdeal in occupational pension sohemes.   This demands that schemes should notdiscriminate against women in the rules for admission to the scheme.   It isproposed therefore to legislate so that women have the same access to occupational schemes as men doing comparable work, so that they are admitted at the same^age, afterthe same period of qualifying employment and on the same basis of compulsion orchoice.   The tests of whether men and women are doing comparable work will be those laid down in the Equal Pay Act 1970.75*   With this fundamental right to equal access secured, the Government will goon to review in detail all the considerations relating to providing cover for women in occupational schemes to see whether there are other respects in which action isrequired to ensure that schemes do not discriminate against women.   The question of representation of women on boards of trustees and management of occupational schemeBis referred to below (paragraph 80).Preservation and Transferability76.   The pension rights of those who leave jobs before normal pension age must be preserved whether or not their occupational pension scheme contracts out.   TheGovernment have therefore judged it right to let the preservation requirements ofthe Sooial Security Act 1973 come into force in April 1975, as planned.   In brief,these require that all occupational schemes should at least preserve or otherwisesafeguard the pension rights whioh the early leaver has earned at the time he leaves.From any point of view they represent a long over-due step forward.   The Governmentappreciate that these requirements involve a considerable degree of adjustment formany schemes, and additional cost, and that the Occupational Pensions Board havedevoted a good deal of effort to helping schemes to implement the requirements.The present need is to get the new system fully established and working smoothly.The Government will maintain a close watch on the way these requirements work inpractice in order to see whether they need to be supplemented.77.   The question of a system of universal transferability of pension rights hasbeen much discussed by those interested in occupational pensions.   Most would agreethat transferability was a desirable ideal j /the difficulty lies in devising workablelegislative requirements capable of universal application, and fair to all concerned.The Government have concluded they cannot deal with the problem in the legislationnow proposed.78.   Protection of the value of pension rights earned and of pensions in payment arevital issues which have already been discussed in this White Paper.   The Governmentare proposing through the minimum benefit rule to require occupational schemes whichcontraot out to revalue, in line with the general movement of earnings, the accruedpension rights of early leavers for which the scheme has taken over liability from
CONFIDE-NTjAL.the State.   The question whether the balance of the pension rightB of early leaversin contracted out schemes, or all such rights in schemes which are not contractedjut, should be revalued is a difficult problem which the Government has underreview.   Increases of pensions in payment do not create a speoial problem, becausethe preservation requirements in the 1973 Act already require preserved pensions in payment to be treated in the same way as full-term pensions.iuestionB Referred to the Occupational Pensions Board19,. There are several matters concerning the actual running of occupational schemesgenerally which in the Government&apos;s view require special attention.   First, theneabers must be able to feel sure that the benefits which they have earned in ascheme will in fact be forthcoming at the time they are due;   and this question ofconfidence becomes particularly important in an era of inflation.   Secondly there is evidence of conoern about the degree of communication between those responsible forsohemes and the members, many of whom for example have no idea what level of pensiontheir scheme provides.   Thirdly, the close relationship between the state and occupational schemes now proposed clearly ought to involve members of schemesthemselves, either as individuals, or through their trade unions or representatives,in the administration and surveillance of Bchemes.80. This is the background to the Government&apos;s recent request to the occupational pensions Board to consider, and to report at an early date on, three issues - whichare interrelated&apos; - affecting all occupational schemes.   They are as follows(a) the financial security of the benefits which schemes have undertaken to provide, ie whether those benefits are adequately secured;(b) the provision of information about schemes, and in particular aboutschemes&apos;&quot;finances, both to members and more generally;   and(c) the possibilities of greater involvement of scheme members,especially women, in the running of their schemes eg as trusteesor on boards of management.In each oase the Occupational Pensions Board have been asked to indicate whether in their view legislation or further legislation is appropriate and if so what itshould cover.
CHAPTER 5THE WAY AHEAD81.   The Governments proposals show the way in which adequate pension provision,such as is common in industralised countries abroad, hut which most people in britain have lacked for too long, can be achieved by a partnership between the stateand good occupational schemes.^Continue with material on the scheme&apos;s economic implications/.82.   The next step will be for the Government to diBcuss their proposals with representative organisations, including the TUC, the CBI, and those concerned withoccupational pension schemes.   Some features, particularly in the area of contracting out, have been deliberately left open and will not be settled until after the viewsof those affected are known.   After taking account of views and comments theGovernment will present the new legislation as early as possible in 1975*   The aimwill be to bring the new scheme into force as quickly as possible, and in any caseno later than April 1978.83.   This is the third pension plan to be put forward by a Government in the last six years.   It draws on the best features of each of the two previous plans and provides a firm foundation for the development of pensions fitted to the needs ofa2 8
Annex CTHE PROBLEM OF CONTRACTING out.   The problem of contracting out is central to the scheme.No contracting out at all would make the scheme much morestraightforward and easy to understand, and would greatly reducethe need for state supervision of the solvency of occupational pension schemes.   This might well have been the correct line totake had these proposals been introduced tihirty years ago.   Howeverthere is now a system of occupational pension schemes covering morethan half the working population and providing in aggregate a largeproportion of the savings in the private sector.   Many of these schemes provide benefits which, when line state basic pension isadded in, provide a high level of pension cover in retirement.   Ifthere were no contracting out system at all, such schemes would inpractice have no option but to cut back their benefits severely soas to keep the total amount of pension cover much the same, andsuch a compulsory upheaval would be regarded as intolerable.   Itwould be fiercely resisted by both those responsible for schemes and representatives of workers and any such proposals would have little chance of success.   Therefore there must be a system of contracting out.2.   But there is a dilemma in choosing the terms of contracting out.If they are too easy then the protection given to the individual isweakened.   Moreover, the more contracting out there is the more .contribution income is lost to the state fund which could have been used to sustain benefits on a pay as you go basis.   If, on the otherhand, the contracting out terms are made too difficult, then the disturbance will be almost as great as if there were no contracting out at all.   The proposals in this paper attempt to resolve the dilemma by setting the conditions at a level which good occupational schemes (effectively final salary schemes) will be able to meet butnot others.3.   This meets the essential condition by giving employers withoccupational pension schemes a resonable choice.   It is very difficultto estimate what proportion of them will choose to contract out.   Ofthe 11 million people covered by occupational pension schemes about  million are in the public sector, with a high level of pensionprovision;   it would be consistent with the previous history anddevelopment of such schemes for them to contract out and theconditions seem to provide a reasonable basis for them to do so.As for the seven million in the private sector about four million will be in schemes which will be able to satisfy the conditions ifthey choose to do so.   On general grounds and particularly from theindustrial relations point of view most employers in this position might be expected to wish to contract out.   However if present economic and financial uncertainties continue to apply up to thetime they have to make the decision, employers might feel verytempted to remove some of the uncertainties by staying in the state scheme - so as in effect to hand a substantial slice of their futurepension liabilities over to the state - and cut back their own
schemes by a corresponding amount.   The outcome in terms of numbers contracted out in this category can only be speculative.Finally there are about three million people covered by schemesother than final salary schemes.   The employers1 choice in this area will be to reshape their schemes so as to meet the contracting out conditions, or to live on top, or to cut back,or even wind up.   Again it is very difficult to say how thenumbers will turn Out.4.   In the light of all these considerations estimates of thenumbers who would be contracted out could range from about fourmillion to around eight million.   The costings in this paper aregiven on the alternative bases of both four and eight millioncontracted out.   In the White Paper itself no single figure willbe given of the numbers expected to be contracted out, but theeffect of contracting out at different points within the rangewill be shown.5.   A number of problems of detail on contracting out remain tobe resolved, for example, about the terms on which people who leaveearly should be bought back into the state scheme.   The aim wouldbe toI leave these open whenever possible for discussion with thepensions interests, including the public sector, before they arefinally settled.X-........CONFIDENTIAL

f2.      The main aim is to raise  the standard of  living of retirement pensioners,  both in absolute  terms and in relation to  the rest ofthe population.    National   insurance pensioners already have aguarantee that  they will  share  in the general  improvement  in living standards made possible by economic growth,  now that  the Governmenthas undertaken to uprate the basic retirement pension  in line with earnings.    The additional  effect of the new scheme will be to raisepensioners&apos;   living standards  faster than those of the  rest of thepopulation.3. ;-   At present,   the basic State pension,   together with payments ofsupplementary pension and rent and rate rebates, provide pensionerswith roughly one-third of  the average  income before tax of  the restof the population,   (counting a child as half an adult  for thispurpose).    It  is estimated that other sources provide a further one-third so that  the average pensioner income  is now around two-thirds of that  of  the rest of  the population.    There  is,  of course;,considerable variation for individuals on either side of  theseaverage levels.4.      By the  time the new scheme  is giving most contracted-inpensioners full benefit at the new rates  -  say in about 40 years&apos;time -  the average value  of  the National  Insurance pension willhave risen to around half  the average income of  the rest of  thepopulation.    Thus,  without assuming any relative  increase inpensioners&apos;   income from other sources,   including occupational schemes,  their average income will have  increased from two-thirdsto about four-fifths of  that of  the rest of  the population.    this improvement will be concentrated on those who do not  have an    badequate occupational pension,  and those who have fewest  resourcesoutside their basic State entitlement.5.      In aggregate,  about  three per cent  of  total personal consumption will  in about 40 years&apos;   time have been transferred to pensioners.    This compares with  their present  share of  the order   *df ten per cent.    There will be a corresponding reduction in the share going to the working population;  but  on any reasonableassumption about  the rate of economic growth this will form a verysmall proportion of  the  improvement  in living  standards of  theworking population over this period.ANNEX economic  IMPLICATIONS OF THE PROPOSALS1,.,     The proposals will  lead to a gradually increasing  transfer of income,  and therefore claims on resources,  from the economicallyactive section of  the community to those who have retired.    This willbe reflected  in the gradual  increase in contribution rates referredto in paragraph 33.    These contributions,  and the  taxationrequired to finance the Exchequer&apos;s share  of  the cost,  will mean that take-home pay of employees will be restricted,  and pricesincreased,  compared with what would otherwise have been the case;but the full  costs will accrue only very gradually and as described below these effects will be far outweighed by the improvement  in living standards generally resulting from economic growth.
6.      The Government recognise,  and attach importance  to,   the contribution made through funded occupational  schemes  to savings.The amount  of  such savings has been estimated as being about 1,200 million in 1971,  and it would seem likely that  there willbe  some effect,  at  least at  the outset,  on these savings.    Theeffect will depend on the numbers  in occupational  schemes whichare contracted out.    However,   the proposals  for partnership with good occupational  schemes are designed to enable  those schemes  to maintain or expand their contribution to savings.7.      From the point of view of  the  individual contributor,  thescheme  implies  some  redistribution of   income  from his  years  in work; to his years in retirement.    For  the community as a whole, the redistribution must be within the  total available at the time for personal consumption - as determined&apos;by the potential  size of thetotal national product and by the claims of  investment, public services and the balance of payments.    Provided that adequate provision  is made for these claims,   there should be no adverse effect on employment or productivity,   or on future economic growth,II2
