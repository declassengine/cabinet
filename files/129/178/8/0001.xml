. SELECT COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYGOVERNMENT OBSERVATIONS ON THIRD REPORT, SESSION 1972-3TRACKED HOVERCRAFT LTDINTRODUCTION1e .  Tho Third Lloport from-the Select Committee on Science and technology, Session 1972-3* wi Tracked Hovercraft Ltd (the Report)was&apos; critical of the previous Government&apos;s decision not to support this subsidiary company of the National Research development corporation (NRDC), and of tho way in which the matter had boonhandled.   The Report also argued tho urgency of future needs for transport systems using advanced methods of suspension andpropulsion,,   It strongly supported a proposal originating fromImperial College of Science and Technology, London, for a newcentre for research and development (R &amp; D) work on guided electrictransport - to be based on the installation already built atEarith, and to be available alike to university scientists, industryand Government.   In addition, tho Report pressed for an urgent and fundamental review of the structure and powers of NRDC, andjit reiteratedan earlier proposal from the First and Fourth Reports from thoSelect Committee on Science and Technology, 1971-2 for the creationof a small, expertly staffed Department, responsible to a minister in the Cabinet and assisted by an Advisory Council, to manageGovernment R&amp;D work as a whole.   The Committee saw this as thebest means of assuring that the vital stage between basic R&amp;Dand commercial evaluation was effectively bridged,2, At the time it relinquished office, the previous Governmenthad not replied to the Report,   The Select Committee has now, however,asked for a reply, /3*    It is not for the present Government to answer for its predecessor, either over tho matter or over tho manner of the cancellation early in 1973 of the Tracked Hovercraft project. This
CONFIDENTIAL&quot;White Paper accordingly concentrates on two main themes.   Eirst,the machinery for innovation, including in particular the NRDC.Second, the scale and purpose of present R&amp;D work in this fieldas related to foreseeable practical noeds, including inparticular the question of the need for a new multi-user centroon the lines proposed by a consortium of Universities (secparagraph 39).THE MACHINERY FOR INNOVATION4.     The Select Committee concluded in the Report (paragraphs207-222) that the Government machinery for developing and exploitinginventions was inadequate.   They contended that there was an urgentneod for a framework within which the feasibility of new ,\;technological developments could be assessed, and for an organisation to ensure that the gap between R&amp;D. and commercial evaluation wasbridged, . They questioned the suitability of NRDC to manage complexdevelopments, and recommended a review the. organisation forinnovation.   Their observations-thus cover the various stages intho process of innovation, from research to exploitation.5.     Government&apos;has considerable experience and expertise, directly or tl^rough its agents, in providing support for fundamentalresearch^ through commissioning of applied R&amp;D, and in thodevelopment and exploitation of inventions.   Many thousands of individual programmes.are involved, of wide variety and scale.This in itself makes generalisation difficult, but broadly speaking,a prediction of market or customer demand is an important factorgoverning the expenditure of public money throughout the process;and it is crucial in the later and most expensive stages ofinnovation.    The Government believes that, as a general rule,market needs and the development of technology should evolve in parallel.   No promising technology ought to be stifled in infancyfor lack of funds, but the scale of funding should reflect thecurrent view of the market potential, and not outrun it,   Uherethis is clear, advanced development should go forward at the pacenecessary to make the new system ready for use when required.2
6,     There are various elements to the Government&apos;s machinery forinnovation; in particular, Government contracts for applied R&amp;D;the Research Councilsj and the NRDC, which is discussed in detailat paragraphs 10-15 belowe7.     Individual Ministers are responsible to Parliament for theexecution of policies defined by the Cabinet, for commissioningR &amp; D in support of these policies, for organising their programme with accountability at all levels and for assigning prioritiesbetween competing claims on their budgets.   For some years, appliedR&amp;D has been planned in response&apos;&apos;&apos;to the functional objectives of Departments and the machinery for implementing this principle was extended and defined in Cmnd 504-6. * Framework for government research and Development&apos;.8,     The Secretary of State for Education and Science provides fundsthrough the University Grants Committee and the Research Councilsfor the development of the sciences and the maintenance of fundamental capacity for research.   But the influence of customerneed is reflected to an appropriate extent in the arrangements for&apos;basic research,,   The Advisory Board for the Research Councils whichadvises the Secretary of State on the allocation of the science budget between the Research Councils and other bodies, has among its members four Departmental Chief Scientists and a representative the Cabinet Office,   The consultative process is further aided by the presence of Departmental representatives on the research councils and their subordinate bodies,9,    The present Government endorses the principles which nowapply and will refine and improve the machinery in the light offurther experience.   Functional organisation and the customer/contractor process aro accordingly tho cornerstones of the Government1policy for applied science and technology.   It is therefore thoGovernment1s view that tho appointment of a Minister for research and Development with statutory powers to adjudicate between-3
CONFIDENTIAL departmental research and development programmes would undermine 1tho positions of Departmental Ministers who are fully accountable        Ifor ensuring that their policy objectives are adequately supported       1in all respects, including research and development.   However, the       1Lord President of the Council is charged with ensuring that there 1is adequate co-operation and co-ordination between Departments Iin the research and development field.   The decision makingmachinery Is thus clearly defined, and the tracked hovercraft issuedoes not itself point to inadequacies in this machinery,THE NATIONAL RESEARCH DEVELOHvhJJT CORPORATION10,   NRDC was set up in 1949 to help the development and exploitation of promising inventions from both the public and private sectors.Its functions wore thoroughly investigated in 1971 as part of a major review of Government&apos;s role in exploiting inventions.   Theprevious Government1s general conclusion was that NRDC had a continuing and useful part to play in this field and that, takenin conjunction with other existing or planned resources withinGovernment, tho Corporation1s functions  did not need to be significantlychanged.   The present Government will keep the effectiveness ofNRDC under review,11,   NRDCs functions and duties are laid down in tho Developmentof Inventions Act 1967,   A public Corporation such as NRDC. canoperate with greater independence than a direct arm of government but is nevertheless subject to some Government control.   The control is not, in practice, a rigid one; exchange of views on broad policy issues and on specific activities has enabled the Government andNRDC to establish a satisfactory working relationship.12,   NRDC is required by the Act to seek formal approval for mostof its external expenditure, and this is given by or on behalf of the secretary of State for Industry, in consultation with other government Departments as appropriate.4    &apos;CONFIDENTIAL
13.   Assessment of the technical and commercial prospects of itsprojects is a major duty of tho NRDC, which has expert adviceavailable from Board Members, executive staff, and when neoossaryoutside consultants.   The Department of Industry  (Dl) brings toboar any Government view on theso matters, and is otherwiseconcerned to ensure that an NRDC proposal neither runs counter toGovernment policy nor duplicates other publicly funded work.   Acheck is also made on whether the company or individual involved is a suitable recipient of public funds.    DI and its predecessorshave co^toidered many hundreds of&apos; applications from NRDC, but onlyin a few cases has statutory approval been withheld.   Moreover,although the Act lays down a total limit on NRDCs borrowings,and account has to be taken of provisions made in ParliamentaryEstimates when considering proposed expenditure, the Department hasnot imposed any specific financial constraint which has proventedthe Corporation from supporting projects of its choice.   TheGovernment cannot, therefore, accept the suggestion in paragraph220 of the Select Committee^ report that the Corporation is placed under excessive financial constraints.14o   NRDCs purpose is to transfer innovation to industry; and totake commercial risks which the market will not boar.   Tho Actrequires it to break even, taking one year with another.   This,moans that, whilst the Corporation seeks a satisfactory return on capital from its portfolio of investments as a whole, it need not look for quick returns in all cases.   It is generally free toapply its own criteria in deciding what projects to undertake,although the G-overnment retains tho authority to approve projectsbefore they start or when extensions are proposed,15.   The Government is satisfied that departmental organisations,supplemented by the NRDC, provide adequate machinery for government participation in the development and exploitation of inventions,5
confidential the TRACKED HOVERCRAFT PROJECTa.     The Project16.   A sufficient account of present policy on advanced systems of suspension and propulsion must start, however briefly, by referenceto the history of the tracked hovercraft project.17.   NRDC set up Tracked Hovercraft Limited (TEL) as a wholly-ownodcompany in 19^7*   The noxi company was to carry out an experimentalprogramme to investigate tho economic and technical potential of ahigh speed ground transport system with air-cushion suspension andlinear induction-motor propulsion.   It was also necessarily concerned to explore power supply and pick-up problems, and.systems forautomatic vehicle control.18.   The project involved the development of full-scale testvehicles running over a now track.   The original aim was to proceed by stages through the testing of a manned experimental vehicle atspeeds up to 250 mph on 10 miles of full scalo track to thobuilding of a prototype and assessment of its suitability for commercial use.   Early in 1973 an experimental vehicle reached a speed of 107 mph oh the one mile of. purpose built track at Earith,The project fell well short of proving the technical potential ofan air cushion system such as to attract commercial support.   its most useful achievements were in basic development work onpropulsion - where the emphasis switched increasingly towardsimproved versions of the linear motor as timo wont on - and infuller understanding of tho air-cushion system and its problems.The final stages of the company&apos;s work also saw the beginnings of research into magnetic suspension systems, which was prompted byindications from work elsewhere that these had potential advantages in terms, for example, of reduced bulk and power consumption.19*   In short, therefore, though THL&apos;s achievements were in somedirections considorable, they wore also necossarily limited. Althoughthe work was to some extent diversified as it progressed, thocompany&apos;s initial commercial objectives for &quot;proving&quot; an air-6
cushion linear induction motor system ldjaited the attention whichcould be paid to other aspects of advanced suspension andpropulsion technology, including in particular its potentialapplication to relatively low speed systems for use in towns.Knowledge v/as therefore advanced in the main on a relativelynarrow front    with the object of securing, either from homemarkets or from overseas, as good and as early a return as possible on the very considerable capital invested.b.     Its Cancellation \\20*   A high proportion of investment went towards advanceddevelopment work on a particular high-speed system, costs forwhich rose substantially beyond initial estimates for a variety of reasons, but notably on account of difficulties met in tho. -   --&apos; - .11.-construction of the special track on which it was hoped that the viability of the air-cushion vehicle would be proved.21.   There was never a certain prospect for overseas markets forsuch a systemj and official studies made for the previous government by an Interdepartmental v/orking Party on Inter-CityTransport (l/PICT) which were concentrated on future passenger needs,reached the conclusion that a non-contact suspension system forintor-city travel in Britain might possibly be economic by about1985, but only in the heavily-used corridor through Birminghambetween London and Manchester and Liverpool.   wPICT also stressed,however, that British Rail&apos;s concurrent work on tho AdvancedPassenger Train (APT) would bo an important factor affectingdecisions about future needs.   It was true that - apart from certainpreliminary work looking at tho possibility of very high speedson conventional rails - this was aimed at speeds rather lower thanthose aimed at in the THL project.   But the AFT had &quot;the immenseadvantage that its track and terminals are already installed, andthat no additional land will be needed&quot;,   Particularly in view ofthis, tho capital costs of constructing new track networks fornon-contact suspension systems would vitally affect any futureinvestment decisions which might be called for should high-speednon-contact    technology show sufficient promise for its practicaluse.to be seriously entertained..7
CONFIDENTIAL   &apos;22.   The previous Government agreed in September, 1971, to allowNRDC to supply THL with a further and final  1.75 million,bringing tho total expenditure authorised for the project to 5.25 million.   By tho summer of 1972, however, these funds were running out, and the Government had then to decide whether therewas any way in which tho company could be preserved.23,   It is not for the present Government to answer for the ensuing processes of decision making, which occupied the second half of 1972, and wore completed early in, 1973.   Tho present government simply notes that, when it was found that THL&apos;programme could not be restructured and funded jointly by Governmentand industry, with a broader programme of research into suspensionand propulsion technology as the prime objective, its predecessorconcluded that the company could no longer be financed from government funds alone, and that the project should be terminated.2!f.   The previous Government also concluded that, taking account offoreseeable practical needs, the relevant technology could best be developed on a much smaller scale, through a series of specificresearch contracts with public and private industry, aimed atadvancing basic knowledge over a wider front and giving british manufacturers opportunities to tackle design and manufacturingproblems of the new technology at an early stage of its development.The then Department of Trade and Industry was to concentrate onlinear motor development   contracts with private sector industry.The Department of the Environment (DOE), in addition to its workconcerned with transport systems, would sponsor, through BritishRail, exploratory research on magnetic suspension and guidance, ratha view to the possible use of the technology in urban and in inter-urban systems. //THE CURRENT POSITION25,   An outline scheme for a series of Government research contractson these lines was accordingly prepared, and announced by thoprevious Government in February 1973*. at the same time as it made public its decision on the cancellation of the project.8
26. . The current position is that DI has placed throe contracts with industry for tho assessment and development of linear motors.The Hirst Research Centre of G.C Ltd has a one-year contract(costing up to  35*000) for a theoretical study of linear motorconfigurations for high-speed transport.   Brush ElectricalMachines Limited, a Hawker Siddeley Company, is undertaking on a cost-shared basis a programme of design and development of linearmotors and associated supply and control systems for heavy transportapplications.   The first phase, covering development and testing of transverse-flux motors, will cost DI  200,&amp;00 and is scheduledfor completion, in Spring 1975.   The third contract for two years,of which the Department&apos;s share of the cost will be  256,000, is with Linear Motors Limited for motor systems for industrial and light transport use,27,   Tho D0E&apos;s Transport and Road Research Laboratory has letcontracts with British Rail&apos;s R &amp; D Division for exploratoryresearch on magnetic suspension and guidance.   This work makes useof existing British Rail expertise in fundamental vehicle dynamicanalysis developed for mechanical suspensions.   The first phase,duo to be completed in mid-1974 at a cost of about  100,000 J]includes study of low-speed applications, concentrating uponstabilised (DC magnet) attraction systems.   The second phase, due -for completion a year or so later at a further cost of about 200,000, will include a study of high-speed applications.   The twophases will of course be linked by basic exploratory work, includingcomponent testing at relatively low speeds.   Further experimental work, including for example higher-speed testing, will be contingentupon the outcome of the present research and of the parallelmarket studies.THi PRESENT GOVERNMENTS POLICY28,   The present Government has concluded that these measures toprotect and develop the relevant technology represent the rightscale of official investment in the short-term, particularly in aneconomic climate where public expenditure has to be restrained withinthe tightest possible bounds.9
CONFIDENTIAL29a   In reaching this conclusion, the Government has taken account 0f ^eviews of the Planning and Transport Research Advisory Council (PATRAC),which advises the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotlandand Wales.   PATRAC endorses the present level of relevant national spending;emphasises the continuing need to update market studies; andargues that the earliest conceivable need for inter-city transportsystems looking beyond those now being explored by British Railfor use essentially on existing track has receded beyond 1985.30,   The Government will watch with particular attention theprospects for applying this technology at relatively low speeds to transport and industrial needs; and will pursue any justifieddevelopment work in this sector beyond the research stage as soonas this is warranted.   It will also ensure that analysis of marketneeds for high-speed or &quot;new technology&quot; transit systems is keptaa up-to-date as necessary, taking account of freight as well as ofpaa3onger uses.   There arc no strong grounds at present for believing that there is a need for moving our freight at highspeeds; but the Government accepts that the demand for freightuses should be considered together with passenger demand, so thatan overall appraisal of needs related to the new technology canbe made.31.   Market needs for systems looking beyond APT can now bo held to havo receded at least sufficiently far for there to be noquestion of difficulty about the provision of an adequate &quot;lead time&quot;for any advanced development work on high-speed non-contact suspensionsystems which may be called for.   It is also important to note thatBritish Rail is at present engaged on preliminary work on an-ultimate &quot;wheel on rail&quot; vehicle which might achieve 250 mph, andmay make use of the linear motor.   This might require newinfrastructure for the high-speed stretches, b^ut^could still useexisting termini and connections..   10
32.   Meanwhile, many fundanental questions about magnetic suspensionremain to be resolved, and, despite the considerable promise of the single-sided transverse flux induction motor which THL developed,comparative assessment of other linear motor configurations isrequired before deciding which, if any, of the many differentsuspension and propulsion systems to take to the stage of advanceddevelopments   The current contracts allow for both experimental workand theoretical studies.33*   Recent developments in the -technology have emphasised the very close connections between suspension and propulsion; and thisunderlines the need for DOE and DI to work in very close contactin supervising their respective research contractors.   They are ofcourse doing so.   low-speed linear motors may have importantapplications in manufacturing industry, and early development workin. this direction will be encouraged to the extent that it can be predicted to produce appropriate returns.   The Government willmeanwhile, seek to develop any further departmental sponsorship of research contract work in these fields in a way which ensures that,while DI discharges its general responsibilities for creatingindustrial capacity in this technology as fully and as effectivelyas possible, the development of applications of the new technologyto transport is sponsored by DOE,   &quot;3h-*   At the same time the Government is supporting, through the science Research Council (SRC), university research in the samefields in order to provide answers to some of the more fundamentalquestions and uncertainties in this technology.   SRC grants to universities include about  100,000 for research on magneticlevitation, linear motors and associated topics, and  80,000 for a comparative evaluation of transport components and systems.   TheSRC is.also providing, the universities with  250,000 for computingfacilities,, primarily for the support of control engineeringresearch, but including support for the use of two different
CONFIDENTIALintermediate-scale track and vehicle facilities being provided forSussex and Farwick Universities through grants from.&apos;tho Y/olfsonFoundation,   SRC is also currently engaged on a general review(with which DOE and DI are associated) of its support for research in the area of advanced suspension and propulsion systems,35.   The Government notes the Select Committee1 s view expressed inthe Report (paragraph 228) &quot;that research in propulsion, suspension,control and track technology must be kept together&quot;.   It recognises the importance of co-ordinating the work and interests of Governmentdepartments, industrial companies, British Rail, SRC and the universities, for which appropriate arrangements have been made.It sees no need, however, either for placing all the work under one organisation, or for conducting it all in one place,36,   The Government is not persuaded that tho only effective wayto develop the technology, particularly at the present experimentalstage, is by full-scale testing on an actual track (Reportparagraph 191).   Full-scale testing, of course, becomes progressively more desir&amp;0/0 as the need for a given system and its technicalrequirements develop,   VJhilo there is uncertainty about which now system,if any, to adopt much of the initial information required for decisions on the next steps in the development process can he obtained by other means.37*   The Government will, of course, encourage any proposals for exports, and for collaboration-with other countries, particularly intho use of expensive industrial test facilities.   In relationto Europe, any new and high-speed ground transportation systommight well require compatibility rather than identity of systems;,but problems arising from variations in national needs,circumstances and resources will nevertheless have to be solved.The Government is in touch with&apos; its European partners on thismatter, and is ready to consider taking part in collaborativestudies or joint industrial activity.   It is already participating in a joint European study of future inter-city passenger transportsystems which looks ahead to 1985, and, tentatively, towards thoend of the century,12CONFIDENTIAL
FUTURE OF THE EARITH SITE38.   Tho Report devoted considerable attention to the futuro of thoEarith site.   It recommended that the Government should accept theoutline proposals from Imperial College of Science and Technologyfor a multi-user test centre at Earith, defray the cost of retaining the site and extending the test track, and meet the initial running costs of the centre.   It also envisaged that industry should pay to use the facilities and that academically based experimental work at the aentro should be funded by SRC or by individual universities(Report, paragraph 200). jj39o   The Government notes the Select C9mmittee&apos;s views expressedin the Report.   Representatives of Imperial College of Science and technology had approached departments before and after the committee reported to expand on the memorandum which they had submitted totho Select Committoe, and SRC subsequently received draft proposals(1)on behalf of a consortium of universities.A &apos; It was apparenthowever, as tho Select Committee themselves recognised, that therewere differing views in the universities on the merits of Imperial   .College&apos;s broad proposals and on the usefulness of the Earith trackfor their own diverse purposes.   The proposals therefore requiredcareful consideration against the normal SRC criteria of academicmerit and national need.   This consideration has been given in thocourse of the review mentioned in paragraph 34 above.   The review,v&amp;ich embraces a general study of the kind of facilities required atthe present stage of research, is not yet complete,&apos; but earlyattention has been given to the possible use of the Earith track,lijhile it is hoped that further discussion with the consortium andother universities will lead to the prevision of an effective focusand framework of all relevant university work, the Council havealready concluded, on the basis of the evidence and arguments presentedconcerning the likely usage of the Earith track over the next fewyears and its usefulness to basic research programmes, that there isno justification at present for keeping the track in use for university research.)   The Consortium comprises the Imperial College of Science and technology, City University, Cranfield Institute of Technology,and University College of Swansea, in association with the universities of Aberdeen, Cambridge, Sheffield and Warwick.
26 July 197414CONCLUSIONS40.   The Government has decided that the foreseeable needs of thevarious Departments involved, the universities and industry donot justify further expenditure of public funds on the track atEaritho  As. a temporary measure, while the future of the trackwas under review, NRDC had been asked not to implement certainactions which would have led to its dismantling and to the disposalof instruments and other equipment.   This request has now been withdrawn.41.   In short, the Government considers that tho -present effort   ,and expense   ere appropriate in scale and pace.   The measures now being taken provide for a balanced programme of basic and applied research, and will supply design, development and manufacturing experience appropriate to the current state ofthinking both on the technology and on market needs.   TheGovernment will keep open the option to enlarge the scale of thework whenever this is justified by technological progress, orfirmly established needs cither at homo or abroad.
