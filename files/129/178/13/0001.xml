The introductory(paragraphs will be circulated separately.Signed   JOHN hunt cabinet office August 1974
PLANNING AGREEMENTS1.    In their application to the private sector, Planning Agreements willprovide a new and improved framework for co-operation between the Governmentand leading industrial companies,   A Planning Agreement will not be an agree-ment in the sense of a civil contract enforceable at law.   It will, however,be given sufficient recognition by statute to enable the company concerned to rely on assistance promised under it.   The Act which gives effect to the new system will also provide reserve powers to require the relevant companies to&apos; provide the Government and the workers in the firm with the information needed to formulate and monitor a Planning Agreement.   There will, however, be no statutory requirement upon a company to conclude an Agreement.2.    The heart of this system will be a series of consultations between theGovernment and companies, leading to an Agreement about plans for the following three years;   these will be reviewed and rolled forward annually.   In thecourse of these consultations, the Government will assess with the companyits needs for assistance to support and reinforce agreed company plans.   Inparticular, if in the course of these discussions it becomes clear that inorder to align the company&apos;s plans with national needs some financialft it ij &apos;assistance is required beyond that which would in any case be available tothe company by way of regional development aid and regional employment premium, the Government will be ready to provide the kind of discretionaryfinancial   assistance by way of grants and loans far which the Industry Actnow provides, and will discuss with the company the scale on which and thepurposes for which this assistance should be provided, so as to meet therequirements of individual recipients and to further the achievement ofnational objectives.   In order that companies shall have greater certaintyin making and carrying out their plans, the Government intend that once anAgreement has been concluded, regional assistance for the projects which it covers will, during the currency of the Agreement, not fall below the ratesin force at the time of the Agreement.   Moreover these discussions could help to identify requirements for investment funds for consideration by theNEB, if necessary by means of joint ventures with the companies.   more generally, the intention is that the outcome of discussions with companies will have an important bearing on the formulation of the Government&apos;s ownplans;   in this way the needs of companies and the economy will be betterserved.1
3.    Financial assistance under the Industry Aot will of course continue to be available for companies not covered by Planning Agreements, as well as thoseentering into Agreements which satisfy criteria for assistance.   The administra-tion of these programmes will be reviewed to ensure that the needs of smallcompanies outside the arrangements for Planning Agreements will be catered for.The Government also intends to conduct a thorough-going review of the arrange-ments for granting regional development aid, but there will be no changes inthe existing arrangements over the next twelve months.   The payment of regional Employment Premium will not be affected by any of these proposals.32
4*    In their discussions with companies, the Government will he concerned only with strategic issues.   In addition, they regard It as most important that the new arrangements should not restrict the freedom of companies to respond to market changes, particularly where they are in competition with overseas manufacturers.   The Government would welcome the views of firms onthe issues that principally concern them.   Clearly they might well vary fromcompany to company hut matters of obvious concern to the Government would include -Investment, with particular reference to its timing and location;Productivity;Employment, with special reference to its regional balance;Exports and import saving, and investment directed to these ends;Product development;Implications of company plans for industrial relations and arrangementsfor negotiation and consultation;Interests of consumers and the conmiunity.5*     The, Government recognise that, even in relation to a small number ofimportant issues of this kind, companies1 plans and forecasts which go beyondthe immediate future may be subject to change at short notice in response to market fluctuations,   Despite these reservations and uncertainties, theGovernment believe that the new relationship they are seeking with companies and the associated financial assistance would benefit the companies taking part and would lead to better arrangements for the management of the economy.COMPANIES TO BE COVERED6i    Tho now arrangements will apply to major and strategic firms in keysectors of manufacturing industry, and in selected industries other thanmanufacturing of particular importance to the oconomy.   Kultinational companies will be included in respect of thoir British holdings.   It will* howeverjnot be possible to operate Planning Agreements from the very outset so thatthey cover all the companies that will eventually fall within their scope.A transitional period will be necessary, both for the companies themselves and for Government Departments which will need to develop adequate arrange-ments to handle the plans which are put to them without delay.   The Governmentare determined to see that the benefits of the new arrangements they proposeshould be secured with the minimum of extra administrative cost for the companies concerned and for the Government service.   They will therefore be selective
CONFIDENTIALin their initial approach, and will introduce Planning Agreements in selectedsectors of particular importance-   We intend to begin with companies in sectors,whichflike the engineering industry, lie at the heart of our export effort,7*     The major nationalised industries and publicly-owned firms will also fall within the scope of the Planning Agreements system, which in their case willbe administered through the sponsoring Departments.   Their relationship with government is already very close, and extends beyond the relevant statutesgoverning the nationalised industries into, for example, the joint scrutiny of their corporate plans.  Recent years have seen the introduction of arrange-ments by which the nationalised industries and major publicly-owned firmssubmit corporate plans to Government, and &quot;by which Departments monitor their -progress, at regular intervals against an annual operating plan.I&apos; C ^%    is   A80     Employees and their representatives will have a major interest in the issues covered &quot;by Planning Agreements.   The Government intend that the plans to be covered by an Agreement will be drawn up by management in close consul-tation with trade union representatives at the level of the firm.   The framingHHHflNRMHHMHMMBRPnand up-dating of Agreements would thus involve a continuing discussion between management and unions and would constitute an important advance in the part to be played by industrial democracy in the planning of company strategy.The Government would also envisage that union representatives from companies,while not formally parties to Planning Agreements, would also take part wherethey so wished in consultations on Agreements with the Government.9.    If consultation is to be effective, union representatives must be provided with all the necessary information relevant to the contents of planning agreements.   The Government would therefore require employers to discloseinformation of this kind, except where disclosure could seriously prejudice the company&apos;s commercial interests or would be contrary to the interestsof national security. ,t!
CONSULTATION10.   The Government propose to enter into immediate discussions with both,sides of industry, and with the National Economic Development Council, aboutthe best means of implementing the new system and the sectors of industryin which it might most usefully be first employed.   The Government&apos;s intentionthroughout would be to look for arrangements which were simple and flexible andwere so far as possible based on the existing^planning arrangements of individual companies.   The kind of procedural arrangements which might leadup to a Planning Agreement are briefly described in an Annex.INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED BY GOVERNMENT11.    The Governments projections and the companies&apos; own intentions and plans will interact on each other:   the primary purpose of a PlanningAgreement is that they should.   In producing their projections the Governmentwill need to take account of companies&apos; own plans, while the companies will.y;ifor their part want to know the Government*s views on the likely developmentof the^economy.   In this way the Government and the companies concerned willshare with each other their developing assessments of future trends.   TheGovernment would welcome the views of those responsible for corporate planning in industry about the information which would be of the greatest value tothem and how it might most suitably be disseminated.   The question is notwhether Government projections should be supplied within the context of planning Agreements but which projections, given the unavoidableuncertainties, are likely to be of most value.5
! NATIONAL ENTERPRISE board . - - -; OUTLINE12.  The Government propose to create a new instrument to secure where necessary large scale sustained investment to offset the effects of the short term pull of market forces.   These new powers of initiative are better exercised through a new agency than dealt with direct by Government,and for this purpose it is proposed to set up a National EnterpriseBoard (not).13*  One of the functions of this new agency will be tb build on andenlarge the activities previously discharged by the Industrial reorganisation corporation (1958-59)i  It will in addition be an industrial holding company withcompanies in nalmfaotoing iadu^.   A numter of exiting Govern-ment shareholdings in companies will be transferred to the Board immediately on its establishment.   Its main strength in manufacturing will come howeverfrom the acquisition of a number of key firms (see paragraph 2  below).   It-1 */V-/,&apos; 1..&apos; ( - -will have power to start new ventures and participate in joint ventureswith companies in the private sector.   Adequate funds will be made availableto enable theXBoard to expand its activities vigorously to discharge the responsibilities set out below-- , --&apos; ^- -a. It will be a new source of investment capital for manufacturing industry; in providing finance it will normally take a correspondingshare in the equity capital.   In this it will set out to supplement andnot to displace the supply of investment from existing financial institutions and from companies&apos; own resources (see paragraph 16).b. It will have the former Industrial Reorganisation Corporation&apos;sentrepreneurial role in promoting industrial efficiency and profita-bility by promoting or assisting the reorganisation or development ofan industry but, unlike the 1958-59, the not will in general retain theshareholdings it acquires.   In discharging these functions it may takefinancial interests in companies// or act in a purely advisory role(see paragraph 17).c. It will act as a holding company to. control and exercise central management of -i. certain existing Government shareholdings vested in iujii. interests taken into public ownership under powers in theIndustry Act 1972, which it is proposed to consolidate and extend;iii* new acquisitions by the not (see paragraphs 18-23).6
&quot;CONFIDENTIALd.     It will be a channel through which the Government will assistsound companies which are in short term financial or managerialdifficulties (see paragraph 22).e.*     It wtfell he an instrument through which the Government operatedirectly to create employment in areas of high unemployment (seeparagraph 25).T,&apos; &quot;ft&quot;ft ^^ftftft^V,^^ (:&apos;&apos;h&apos;\Y-:!:y-y(:&apos;-&apos;:%s ftftftft/;.:-;.:&quot;;/;// ft:%ftftftft\!;;;.r/^ftft;:&apos;/ft;ftft^ftftftH%: ft :&apos;    &apos; &apos;   3f.    Government Departments, the nationalised industries nnd private firms will be able to seek the advice of the not on financial andmanagerial issues.14.   The Board will be responsible for securing the efficient management of the companies and assets vested in it.     It will compete with companies in the private sector and be expected to operate in accordance with suitablefinancial objectives.     Its guiding financial objective will be to secure anadequate return on that part of the nation*s capital for which it is responsible.    When the Government require the not to depart from this objective on social grounds, the subsidies will be administered by the not,and will be separately accounted for.    The Board&apos;s financial arrangements will have to be carefully worked out to safeguard against uneconomic allocation of the nation&apos;s resources.INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY15*   The Government envisages a major development of industrial democracythroughout industry in the years ahead.    Within that framework, the KBB will play its part in ensuring that enterprises under its control provide for thefull involvement of employees in decision-making at all levels.I PROVISION OP INVESTMENT CAPITAL16.   Within the framework of Ministerial oversight outlined below, the NEBwill have powers to make loans and to take shareholdings in companies whereit considers that such action is in the public interest and in particularwhen in its judgement lack of finance is prejudicing worthwhile industrialdevelopment.     In deciding which projects to support within its financialallocation, it will be expected to give emphasis to the promotion of industrial efficiency!   to the crea-fcion of employment opportunities in assisted areas;to increasing exports or reducing undue dependence on imports;   to co-operationwith the Offshore Supplies Office in promoting development in the offshore oil supplies industry;   and to sponsoring investment that will offset the effectof monopoly. CONFIDENTIAL
RESTRUCTURIHG INDUSTRIES17*   In exercising its powers -fco promote or assist in the reorganisationor development of an industry the Board may take share in the equity capital of existing companies or take part in the establishment of new enterprises.When it is involved in restructuring programmes, its overriding purpose willbe to promote the effectiveness and efficiency of the industry.     It will work closely with the Department of Industry which will he able to complementinitiatives &quot;by the MSB through the use of its powers of selective financialassistance under the Industry Act.VESTING EXISTING GOVERNMENT SHAREHOLDINGS18.   The Government have a number of existing shareholdings in industry.Thei^ acquisition over a large number of years has been in response to adiverse range of policy objectives.    Some of these holdings may not be appropriate for vesting in the not eg, the holdings in shipbuildingcompanies or-m companies whose activities are largely overseas(British Petroleum, Cable and Wireless Ltd and the Suez Finance Company).    -Itis however intended that the Government shareholdings in the following companies;aMBHHBHBHHBHBiilHHHIshould be vested in the not -Rolls Royce (1971) LtdInternational Computers (Holdings) Ltd[George Kent Ltd]\\&apos;Nuclear Enterprises LtdBunford Elliott LtdKearney and Trecker Marwin LtdNorton Villiers Triumph Ltd
FUTURE ACQUISITIONS&apos;19.   During tho past few years vast industrial onpi^a have been built on tho basisof asset-stripping and financial manipulations.   These have paid scant regarding to the interests of the workers in the firms involved and the real needs ofthe national economy,,   The MB will be the instrument by which the Governmentensures that the nation&apos;s resources are deployed to the benefit of all, by extending public ownership into profitable manufacturing industry inaccordance with the policies defined in paragraphs  20 to 23 belcw0loqcisiticas by, a or on behalf of, the not nay take plaoo in a- number ofwaysu   Wherever possible, companies will be wholly acquired by agreementsMinority holdings in companies may be acquired in future in return forassistance from the Government under the Industry Act and these will normally be held by the not.   The Board may also acquire part holdings in companiesthrough joint ventures or through its participation in a reorganisation.   Butto act decisively in its role of creating employment and creating new industrial capacity, the Board will need a number of   companies where it holds -]00 per cent of the equity capital, in order to avoid conflict between its objectives andthe interests of private shareholders.  When a company is provided with specialregional assistance, it is not intended that the not should on that account&apos;alone take a shareholding in the company.   The Government consider that suitablecategories of firms for acquisition include those where there is a dangerof a British company passing into foreign controls and sectors whereacquisition by the not would stimulate competition where this is now weak,07-;:5\li&apos;-tv^ \^:-;:XSiiy:.    -..-.J;.;i,i;^..-:i;&apos;i&apos;v-:v&apos;.   &apos;;:J^^^^;H-::: /V;:;v&quot;:y7v:i7 CSto21.   The main thrust of the Government *s proposals for extending public owner-ship will follow the programme set out in its Election Manifesto.   ThePHbHHBHMSMHHGovernment will soon publish their proposals for development land.   plans have already been announced to establish a British National Oil Corporationwhich will safeguard the country&apos;s stake in oil from the Continental Shelfand to take the shipbuilding industry into public ownership.   The aircraft industry will also be nationalised/and the Government&apos;s proposals for it willbe published separately.   Outside manufacturing, the Government plan to extend the public sector in the road haulage industry and to establish a vigorous,competitive public sector in the construction industry.   They are alsopreparing a fully comprehensive soheme for bringing commercial ports andcargo-handling activities under public ownership and control.   For the ports,a new National Ports Authority, separate from the not, will be established,-with powers of control and co-ordination.9
22.   Although the NED will he principally concerned with profitable companies,it may on occasion he called on to take over an ailing company which is in danger of collapse but needs to be maintained and restored to a sound economic basis for reasons of regional employment or industrial policy.   This responsi-bility of the not will be distinct from its other functions, and will be separated in such a way from them that the not will be compensated specificallyfor this rescue activity, to ensure that its overall financial discipline is notundermined.   The Board may also be asked to act in   support of financial measures by the Secretary of State for Industry to assist a company in temporary difficulty^ for example by providing managerial reinforcement.23o   The preceding paragraphs represent the Government&apos;&apos;s policy towards public ownership for the next Parliament.   If unforeseen developments require further proposals to be framed, the Government would bring them before Parliament and anycompulsory acquisition would require a specific Act of Parliament.   In circum-stances of compelling urgency the Government would bring the issue beforeParliament and any action would require specific Parliamentary approval.   Ifany compulsory acquisition proved to be necessary it would be subjectto prompt and fair compensation to existing shareholders.THE OFFICIAL TRUSTEE2A*   The Government wish however to retain other means of dealing with factoryclosures in the private sector on those occasions when, for social and economic reasons, it is desirable to find some way of keeping a plant in operation whileGovernment Departments and other interests concerned consider whether a permanent solution to the resulting problem can be found.   To supplement the powers that already exist under Sections 7.and 8 of the Industry Act, which enable financialassistance to be provided in order to sustain productive capacity, it may thereforebe desirable to provide for the intervention of a Government Manager or Trustee whowould take over temporary responsibility for handling the crisis.   But such aproposal inevitably raises difficult issues of company law and will need further study before decisions can be taken by the Government.10
CREATING JOBS25,   The Government recognise the importance industry attaches to stability and certainty in financial incentives to stimulate industrial and commercialthe present &quot;broad framework of measures introduced in the 1972 Industry Act.themselves inadequate,   the Government need a power of direct action and theNational Enterprise Board will therefore have a responsibility to createemployment through commercially sound public enterprises and joint ventureswith private enterprise in the areas of high unemployment.   Its subsidiary companies will qualify for financial assistance under the Industry Act onthe same terms as comparable companies in the private sector.expansion in areas of high unemployment. ^They therefore propose to maintainBut the experience of the last 25 years shows that financial incentives are by11
FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS26,   The National Enterprise Board will he funded by the Government and theSecretary of State for Industry will be empowered, with the approval of theTreasury, to make funds available by way of loans or in the form of publicdividend capital.   This is capital which does not bear a fixed rate ofinterest, but on which a public corporation is expected to pay a dividendsimilar to dividends on equity shares in private companies.   Since the NEBwill he competing with the private sector and is intended primarily to operate within profitable sectors of manufacturing industry, it is appropriate that a part of its funds should have the character of equityrather than of fixed interest finance.27e   The Board will be a source of finance for the companies in which it holdsshares and for any new public enterprise which it establishes   as envisaged in paragraph 16.        The not*s internal financial relationships with itssubsidiary companies will be for it to settle with them.   The not will begiven financial obligations which reflect its duty of securing the efficient management in the public interest of the companies vested in it.   Detailedfinancial guidelines for this purpose will be prescribed by Government.RELATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT28.    Within the framework of its constitution and the funds made availableto it, the not will be free to exercise its commercial judgement incarrying out the functions described in paragraph 13 above.   It will howeverrequire the prior agreement of the Government before it takes a controlling interest in any enterprise or a minority interest exceeding  5 million.   The12
policy objectives to which tho not will be required to contribute are so&apos;wide ranging that it would be unrealistic to try to enshrine them rigidlyin an Acta   There will also be occasions when the Government will wish to influence the activities of the Board and its constituent companies in thenational interest.   The Government will therefore need a power to give general and specific directions to the Board.   The Government will not however interfere in detailed issues of day to day management.   directions to the not will have to be given in writing by the Government and will bepublished in due course in the Boards annual report.PARLIAMENTARY CONTROL-&quot;^i) &apos;&apos;K&quot;)&apos; &quot; &apos;    M &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;\f:   A&apos; &quot; : j .&apos;&quot;290   The not will be set up under a new Industry Bill which will ocneolidatand develop existing legislation to promote national industrial expansion.The Board will be accountable for its actions to the Government who, in turn, will be fully accountable to Parliament for the Boards expenditure.In addition, the Board will produce an annual report and accounts whichwill be laid before Parliament and its activities, like those of any other major public sector body, will come under review by the appropriateParliamentary Committee.30o   The Government already have powers under Sections 7 and 8 of theIndustry Act 1972 to provide financial assistance to a company by takingshare capital.   These powers of agreed share purchase will be widened and made permanent.   The Government propose that Parliamentary control of thisextended power should be on the lines of Section 8 of the Industry Act,ie expenditure on a single acquisition in excess of  5 million should beauthorised by Resolution of the House of Commons under main legislation 8which provides the means by which this is to be done.I13
SCOTLAND, WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND31.   In Scotland, the Government have announced their intention tointroduce legislation setting up a Scottish Development Agency, responsible to the Secretary of State, which will be given a substantial measure ofresponsibility for the promotion of industrial and economic development.320   The Government consider that the most effective assistance and support for the modernisation and growth of Scottish industry will beachieved by giving the Scottish Development Agency executive responsibilitiesover a wide field.   It has therefore been decided that &quot;appropriate functionsof the not should be carried out in Scotland by the Scottish DevelopmentAgency, and that the Agency should be fully associated with the Board inconsideration of matters of relevance to employment and economic growth inScotland,   Comparable arrangements will be made in Wales and, as appropriate,in Northern Ireland.14
ANNEXPLANNING AGREEMENT procedure.    A Planning Agreement will not be an agreement in the sense of a civilcontract enforceable at law.   It will, instead, reflect the outcome of discussions between a company, the unions and the Government during thecourse of which it is hoped that agreement will have been reached about the shape and direction of the company&apos;s plans and their relationship to theGovernment&apos;s economic objectives.   The kind of information which each company is asked to provide will aim to reflect that company&apos;s own planning system and its accounting arrangements.   In companies with effective corporate planningarrangements the normal pattern is for plans to be revised annually and rolledforward for a further year.  At the same time account is taken of the extentto which, the company has succeeded in achieving its planning objectives inthe past year.2.    The Government have it in mind that Planning Agreements should take account of this approach:   companies would be asked to provide the appropriateGovernment Department and unions with information of 3 main kinds.   First,there would be information relating, perhaps, to the 2 or 3 years immediatelypast.  In the early stages, while experience of Planning Agreements was being built up, it would obviously be helpful if this material could be providedsomewhat in advance of information about future plans so that the GovernmentDepartment concerned eould familiarise itself with the company1s situation in preparation for the forthcoming discussions,,3.    Second, companies might be asked to provide forecasts relating to thetopics to be covered by an Agreement and looking up to 3 years ahead..   Thoycould also be asked to give an indication of any longer term plans which theymight have which would be likely to affect the main development of thecompany or its pattern of investment, employment or trading activity.   Third,the company v/ould as a separate matter be asked to keep the Department intouch with any intended major departures from its plans as and when theyarose,4,    The period to which the Agreement related would also reflect thecircumstances of the individual company.   In some cases the intentions aboutthe future may be so firm, eg in relation to a major new development project,that it would be possible to reach agreement which might be expected to15
continue for 2 or 3 years with little or no need for change.   On the otherhand, and it nay well be more commonly, a company might have a set of plansabout the.future which were constantly being revised as external circumstanceschanged.   In that event it might be more appropriate to have what would in substance be a rolling Agreement relating to the 3 year &apos;fcrward period andrenewed annually with whatever changes to past expectations circumstances might be agreed to require.5*    As paragraph2 of the White Paper describes, Planning Agreements wouldprovide the context within which to determine the need for. selective financialassistance.   Moreover, when an Agreement was concluded the projects to vfoichit related would qualify for regional development grant at not less thanexisting rates for 3 years&apos;.If-1 August 197416
