THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 7619 July 1974CABINETTHE DISPERSAL OF GOVERNMENT work from london memorandum by the Lord President of the council. The Government is under increasing pressure to announce its conclusions on the Hardman Report.    We are committed to say somethingbefore the House rises for the Summer Recess.    We shall be muchreproached, not least by our supporters in Scotland, the North and NorthWest, if we either fail to do so or say that we have been unable to reach decisions.    The electoral situation in Scotland is especially difficult andit would be helped by an effective programme of dispersal.2. The situation reached after discussion among colleagues may besummarised thus:-a. We have already agreed to disperse some 9, 000 posts,including some 1, 600 announced by our predecessors.b. Colleagues have offered to disperse a further 9, 000 posts and to decentralise 2, 000, making a total of 20, 000.c. The distribution offered is grossly imbalanced. Almostnothing goes to Scotland and very little to the North and NorthWest, while Wales would get over 9, 000.d. We are asked not to disperse large parts of the Ministryof Defence and part3 of the Home Office and of the Foreign and commonwealth Office, totalling some 7,500 posts, although theywere recommended for dispersal.e. We are asked to defer decisions on the dispersal of the manpower Services Commission and on the location of thelaboratory of the Government Chemist (some 1, 000 posts)and, which I think we can agree, on the Board of InlandRevenue (1, 600), because of the proposed tax changes, andof the Health and Safety Commission (500), because it willnot be established until the autumn.178COPY NO
3. It is my conviction that we must now come to a comprehensiveset of decisions on the Hardman proposals.    His minutes of 13 and 25 Juneindicate that this is also the Prime Minister&apos;s view.    I will not repeat thearguments as they are well known to all my colleagues.    I fully recognisethat some dispersal proposals will make more difficult the efficient running of Departments and will cause genuine anxiety to staff, but I believe thatthe wider interests of the country as a whole, to say nothing of the interestsof the Government Service in easing its recruitment and accommodationproblems in London, require us to take a resolute initiative to move workwhere it is needed and to overcome such operational and human problemsas may arise.    In brief, I believe that we must not shelter behindoperational and staff objections to what everyone outside London and theSouth East believes to be right, that we have no excuse for deferringdecisions any longer and that these decisions &quot;must contain substantialbenefits for Scotland, Wales, the North West and Norths4.        Accordingly, I ask my colleagues to agree to a dispersalprogramme to be announced before the Summer Recess, deferring decisions on only the Inland Revenue and the Health and Safety Commission.    I attachan oral statement giving details of the programme, which I also ask mycolleagues to approve.  The details may be summarised thus:-Locations and DepartmentsGlasgow:Ministry of Defence      6, 000Ministry of overseas development 1, 000n   -    tr* ApproximateRegion/Country     num^r of postsScotland 7, 000Wales 7,400 Cardiff/Newport:Ministry of Defence 5, 000Trade/Industry 1,600Exp.

This compares with Sir Henry Hardman&apos;s recommended total of31, 400, but 87 per cent of the work would go to assisted areas, comparedwith little more than 50 per cent in his recommended solution.    Giventhe promise of more dispersal to come when decisions are reached on thedeferred items I believe that this would be an acceptable package but in thelight of the expectations which have been aroused I do not believe that wecan do less.6.        I should remind my colleagues that dispersal will inevitably resultin some extra costs in the *arly years, although in the longer term therewill be substantial savings because accommodation costs are lower in theprovinces than ir, London.    Extra costs in the next 5 years are likely to amount to between  20 million and  40 million, for which no provision has yet been made in PESC.EWSCivil Service Department19 July 1974
DRAFT STATEMENT annex the Hardman Report recommended the dispersal of some 31,000posts from Government Departments and related organisationsin London.     Over one-third of these would have stayed inthe South East Region;   little more than half would have gone to assisted areas.     The Government regards such a distributionas unacceptable, because it undervalues the importance of the opportunities for administrative work that dispersal can providewhere they- are most needed.     We have deferred decisions on two of Sir Henry Hardman&apos;s proposals owing mainly to organisa-tional changes since we came to office, but in reaching decisions on the remainder we have tried as far as possibleto provide new office employment in places where it will dothe most good.     I am circulating full details in the official report but the main features are as follows.Some 7,000 posts from the Ministries of Defence and overseas development will go to Glasgow.     A similar number from theMinistry of Defence and other Departments will go to Cardiffand Newport.     Some 6,000 posts will go to the North WestRegion, the bulk of them to Merseyside, including elements ofthe Ministry of Agriculture and the Home Office.     The head-quarters of the Property Services Agency, some 3,000 posts,will go to Teesside, while the Laboratory of the GovernmentChemist will move to West Cumberland and 500 posts from theDepartment of Health and Social Security will join its unitsalready in Newcastle.     The number of posts to go to places in the South East Region will fall from the 12,000 recommended in the Report to 850.The proposals on which we shall take decisions later concern the Board of Inland Revenue and the Health and Safety Commission.In the former case, it has been necessary to review Sir HenryHardman&apos;s recommendation in the light of proposed changes in personal taxation, but it is expected that the resultingdisposition of Inland Revenue work will be substantially to the benefit of the assisted areas and that it will includethe relocation of some /I,6007London posts.     In the latter case, the Government wishes io consult the Commission when itis established in the autumn before taking a final view on the siting of its headquarters.The distribution I have outlined improves considerably onthat recommended by the Hardman Report.     Nearly 90$ of the   ^dispersed posts will be located in assisted areas.     TheGovernment hopes that this will be welcome, both in the areas concerned and more generally.     Inevitably, it has not proved possible to provide work for all.the places which have offered to receive it, but the Government believes that it will be widely accepted that the programme includes those with very strong arguments for such a reinforcement of their employmentstructure.     For its part, the Government expects to reapmajor benefits in terms of better recruitment than in London,improved working conditions for staff and a reduction of thecost of its office estate.     Such is the importance of these
&quot;benefits, and of the creation of new employment in the assisted areas, that although the present programme is a major new contribution to dispersal policy, the Government willcontinue to look for further opportunities to disperse head-quarters work from London and, wherever possible, to site inthe assisted areas such new organisations as may from time totime be established.     Opportunities may thus arise to placework in parts of the country which have argued for dispersalin connection With the new programme.     The Government isparticularly anxious that such places should understand thattheir arguments have been considered and that this announce-ment does not mean the end of an active dispersal policy.The programme is the &quot;biggest dispersal exercise undertaken in peacetime.     As such, it has major implications for the orgah-isation of work, for staff as individuals and for localauthorities.     The completion of the programme will of coursespread over a period of years, but the Government, will now get in touch with the local authorities concerned to. discuss time-tabling and related matters.     It will wish to pay particular attention to the welfare of staff.     While the decisions willin general be welcome to staff serving in headquarters officesalready outside London and to others, it is unlikely that all will at once commend themselves to the staff affected inLondon.     The Government will therefore make it its business to ensure that, in consultation with staff through the whitley council machinery, such problems as the decisions may presentare- overcome.     In this context improved transfer terms havealready been agreed with moves of this kind in*mind.     I am glad to take this opportunity of reaffirming that therewill be no redundancies among non-mobile staff in London asa result of dispersal and that the Government will so far aspossible select staff to fill dispersed posts on a voluntary basis.In conclusion, I confirm the siting of a large administrativecentre in Washington New Town.     Subject to Parliament approving the scheme, we shall establish there the headquarters of the family Endowment Scheme ^which will provide some 2,000 posts.We shall also site in Washington an Inland Revenue computercentre amounting to some 800 posts^.7    Taken together this programme amounts to a total of over 31.700 posts.     the siting of the great bulk of these will widen the careeropportunities open to qualified boys and girls in some ofour biggest cities and will thus go some way towards redressingthe imbalance between the South East and other parts of thecountry.     This is a further practical expression of our determination to achieve a more equitable distribution ofjob opportunities throughout the country and will, I am sure, commend itself to the House.18 July 1974
