5DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government(74) 82 re copy NO     id25 July 1974CABINETINTERNATIONAL PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT. (INDUSTRIAL) LTDMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. The Ministerial Committee on Industrial Develppment(IDV),/rat their meeting on 23 July, were unable to reach agreement on thequestion of Government assistance to maintain employment at theformer IPD (Industrial) Ltd factory at Kirkby.background.        The Kirkby factory has a long history of industrial trouble, andthe Prime Minister was actively concerned in seeking a solution when a previous &quot;sit in&quot; was held in 1972.    Its ownership has changed handsseveral times.    Its last owners, IPD (Industrial) Ltd, build up employ-ment from 300 to 1, 100 workers engaged in producing night storageheaters, metal pressings and orange juice.    They ran into financialtrouble and appealed for Government aid.    At their meeting on 11 june the Ministerial Committee on Public Enterprise declined to give assistance to the firm but, recognising that it would go into liquidation,authorised the Secretary of State for Industry to tell the unions, without commitment, that the Government were doing their utmost to find a wayto enable employment to be provided for the present workforce.Consultants were also commissioned to prepare a feasibility study forthe use of the factory;  they estimate that this will take about 6 months tocomplete.3.        The Receiver could give employment to 450 workers at thefactory to maintain the viable parts of IPD(Industrial)ls former activity,but the workforce refused to accept this and have &quot;sat in&quot;.    The Secretaryof State for Industry, after consultations with the workers and consultants,has proposed -lv    that the Government should acquire the assets from the receiver and engage the consultants to manage the enterpriseto give employment to an additional 150 men for 6 months on a break even basis (while research for other ways of using the plant goes on);1
ii.    that the unutilised 500 workers should be maintained on full pay,4.        The first of these proposals could be carried out under Section 7of the Industry Act and would cost between  3.3 million and  5. 8 milliondepending on whether it was necessary to buy the factory outright.    Some    /of this cost could be recoverable if it proved possible to resell the factoryas a going concern in due course.    The second proposal would cost a netadditional sum of  300, 000, assuming that these men would otherwisereceive earnings related unemployment benefit.    It would be necessaryto rest on the authority of the Appropriation Acts for this payment, and astatement should be made to Parliament.ISSUES5.        The Committee recognised the social and political arguments for safeguarding jobs in an area of high unemployment.    The weight ofopinion in IDV was therefore in favour of the first proposal, but theChief Secretary, Treasury felt that the cost of creating the additionaljobs was excessively high, and reserved the Chancellor of the Exchequer^v?position.    Most members of the Committee however did not favour thesecond proposal, which would create a precedent for retaining workers on full pay in the hope of eventually finding them jobs, which could prove embarrassing in other cases.conclusion.        I invite my colleagues to decide:a. whether they agree with the first proposal in paragraph above and, if sob. whether they also agree to proposal ii. in that paragraph.Privy Council Office25 July 19742
