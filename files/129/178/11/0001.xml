Document is the property of her britannic majesty*s governmentGW. . COPY NO     78   &apos;31 July 1974I cabinetASSISTED AREA BOUNDARIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for industry.        The Cabinet discussed possible changes in the assisted areaboundaries on 11 July, on the basis of a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C(74) 68).    Although the majority were not in favourof making any changes (at the moment) it was considered inappropriateto take a final decision before the Chancellors economic measures were known.2.        In my view the Chancellor&apos;s statement, and particularly the doubling of the Regional Employment Premium (REP) has changed thesituation significantly and strengthened the case for making limitedchanges in the assisted area boundaries now.3. In this context the main effect of the doubling of REP is toincrease substantially the financial advantage to manufacturing industry of the Development Areas (DAs) over the Intermediate Areas (IAs).The relative position of those IAs which are near to and in competition with the DAs is thus significantly worsened.    There have already beenstrong representations from Edinburgh (and to a lesser extent Cardiffand Newport) since the Chancellor^ statement.    In my view the case for upgrading Edinburgh, Leith and Portobello, which are completelysurrounded by DAs and well over 100 miles from the nearest IA-, is nowoverwhelming.    The case for Cardiff, though less compelling, is closely linked politically with that for Edinburgh,    The current review of theproposed closure of the East Moors steelworks is, however, an argument for deferring a final decision on Cardiff.4.        Merseyside and North West Wales will both gain in absolute terms from the doubling of REP, but their position relative to the restof the DAs is unchanged and the urgent need for further action remains.As for Chesterfield, we have always recognised that if any places areupgraded then Chesterfield must be given IA status at the same time.Changes have to be made by Statutory Instrument, which can be laidand brought into force in the Recess.
5. The cost of the five upgradings (Merseyside, North West &quot;Wales,the Scottish LA, the Cardiff travel-to-work area and Chesterfield) would now be some  25 million a year and about half that figure if Cardiff is excluded.6.        I invite the Cabinet to agree to the immediate upgrading ofMerseyside, North West Wales, the Scottish IA and Chesterfield; andto consider whether to upgrade Cardiff now or to announce thatCardiff&apos;s (and Shotton&apos;s) case for DA status will be determined in thelight of the outcome of the steel closure review.A W BfIDepartment of Industry31 July 19742
