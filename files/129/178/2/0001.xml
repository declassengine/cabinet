THE CYPRUS CRISIS .The Military SituationSaturday.. 20 July ; &apos;1.        At about 0i;00 (all times GMT) the Turkish invasion beganwith air sorties, seaborne landings, and parachute troop landings.Turkish Cypriot Fighters throughout the island were activated.Fighting broke out in Nicosia and the Turks claimed (wrongly)that resistance in Kyrenia had been overcome.   Nicosia airportwas bombed and Turkish forces attempted to gain-control there.2.        In Athens general mobilisation was ordered at 1100 and the10th Division was moved east towards the Greek/Turkish borderin Thrace.   Negotiations, in Nicosia for a ceasefire along the green Line, continued throughout the afternoon but were neverwholly effective.3.        By the early afternoon Turkish reinforcements in thenorthern enclaves and in Nicosia   may have amounted to 6,000men and s seined generally successful though fighting continued&apos;in Nicosia and at the airport.   However some Turkish enclaveshave been captured by the Greek Cypriots, and in Limassol 10,000Turkish Cypriots are reported held by the National Guard underUN supervision.   By the evening it was clear that Turkish controlof Kyrenia was still disputed.Sunday 21 Julyh.        Heavy fighting continued in most areas, particularly inKyrenia and Nicosia.   Turkish airborne troops reinforced Turkish-Cypriot fighters at Nicosia, where the Greek Cypriot areas were attacked by Turkish aircraft.   Turkish air-strikes also damaged the airport runway but paratroops failed to gain, control of it.Turkish Cypriot enclaves fell in Paphos and probably Famagusta.
During the night of Sunday/Monday1 the Greeks flew in 11 transport aircraft to Nicosia, probably with arms supplies etc.Current;&apos; assessment . -5.        It seems clear that the Turks badly misjudged both the potential extent of the National Guard -resistance and the ability of or&amp;ying Turkish Cypriot enclaves to hold out until relieved.They made no attempt to secure the deep water port of Famagusta;and their failure to gain control of Nicosia airport prevented the rapid build-up essential for a successful operation.   If the conflict continues the Turks would probably be able gradually to gain the initiative if they succeeded in reinforcing quickly,but there is no question now of a quick victory, and the GreekCypriots will be able to use captured Turkish-Cypriot&apos; enclavesas a bargaining counter when the situation turns against them.Protection of UK Citizens6.        during 20 and 21 July Commander British Forces Near Bast(CBFNS) organised the withdrawal of the families of Britishservicemen numbering about 17,000   into the SBAs from the neigh-bouring towns.   A cease-fire was negotiated in Limassol undercover of which families were taken out by British military transport the only British civilian casualty occurred when the son of aserviceman was caught in cross-fire between Greek- and Turkish-Cypriot s in Famagusta on 21 July and fatally wounded.7.        Following a temporary truce in Nicosia on 21 July a convoy of British military vehicles under armoured car escort hadassisted in the evacuation of some kf500 non-Cypriots to theeastern SBA.   By last night, apart from dependants:, some ij-,500UK belongers, 500 non-British and 5000 Cypriot refugees had entered the SBAs. &apos;Contingency Plans8.        Ulans to reinforce the SBA- garrison were put into effectearly,-on 20 July.   Two Royal Marine Commandos (one from HMS Hermes)have arrived;, and the balance of the force, including one infantry
infantry battalion and three armoured car squadrons will be in position by 26 July.   Steps have been taken to ensure the con-continuation of essential services in the absence of local Cypriotlabour; and personnel required to supervise total withdrawaliff required) have been deployed from, the UK.   Haval forcesoffCyprus consist of EMS Hermes (with 18 transport helicoptersembarked) HK8 Devonshire (guided missile destroyer), MS Rhyl andMS&apos; Andromeda; (frigates) together with support vessels.    All canassist in evacuation if necessary.   Other ships are en route forthe area or are at reduced notice in home torts.
DIPLOMATIC MOVES .    &quot; ;20 JULY3 ,       Between 0l\M5 a^d 0700 the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth. Affairs spoke twice to Dr Kissinger and summoned theTurkish, Greek and Soviet representatives in London.   He asked; theTurkish Government to cease hostilities immediately and to attendtalks in London.   He warned the Greek Charge d&quot;Affaires that the GrlNational Guard bore responsibility for this situation which had leathe invasion and asked for Greek representatives to attend the Lohlltalks.   He also warned the Greek Government- to dp nothing which iai$aggravate the situation, a warning reiterated at a second meeting v;iDr Kissinger had told the Foreign Secretary that the Greeks had spo!to Mr Sisco of a threat to declare war on Turkey and EiTOSIS.2. &quot;In support of the Foreign Secretary, IIM - Ambassadors in. At--ensjAnkara pressed for early replies. The Greek response at 1200 was t!the Greeks would send a representative to London if the Turks ceasedfire and withdrew to their enclaves. Ho reply to &quot;the British recjusifor the Turks to send representatives to. London was received and. MrSisco, then in Ankara made no progress.&apos;3* The NATO Council met during the morning, with wide support for/proposals. ;f or the London talks.h. In Hew York the Security Council met and adopted at 0030 on 21July Resolution Ho 353 calling for:-(i)   general ceasefire;(ii)   end to foreign military intervention;(iii)   withdrawal of foreign military personnel other thanthose present under the authority of the international agreement on Cyprus;(iv)   negotiations-between Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdo21 JULY5.       In Ankara the Turks informed Mr Sisco that they would agree [Uceasefire, as requested in the Security Council Resolution, provided they received assurances from&apos; the Americans that the Creeks would alabide by it.    They could not accept the other requirements of theResolution-nor that their forces should withdraw to the Turkish end
In two telephone conversations with the Foreign Secretary i;he TurkishPrime Minister agreed in principle to a meeting with the foreign secretary and said that the National Security Council would considerhis recommendations for a -ceasefire. -  -.6.       In two telephone calls Dr Kissinger informed the foreign secretary that he was hopeful that both the Greeks and the Turks would accept a ceasefire.   Mr Sisco would attend, the conference, whichcould be held in Vienna, as agreed between the Foreign Secretary andthe Austrian Chancellor.7.       Dr Kissinger then informed the Foreign.Secretary that the GreekGovernment had accepted a ceasefire, but that the Gre.ek Prime minister had informed him that &quot;the Captains are going to ta^e over&quot; within2h. hours.8,    &apos; Our delegation at NATO subsequently reported that the Greekshad informed US Ambassador in Athens that Greece would withdraw . fromNATO.   Senior- Greek officers at SHAPE had instructions that all&apos; Creekofficers there should leave immediately. &apos;9.       Late on 21 July the Foreign.Secretary and Dr Kissinger agreedthat the best hope in the immediate&apos;future was for maximum pressure to be brought on Greeks and Turks by strong formal Notes from,;NATO &quot;and e.c. members demanding, acceptance of a ceasefire.    Dr Kissingeralso spoke strongly to Mr Eceyit.22 JULY .10.     At 00J&apos;0 Dr Kissinger informed the Foreign Secretary that &apos;cheTurks had agreed to a ceasefire from I4OO hrs 22 -July.   At 02h5 the.State Department reported Greek agreement to this ceasefire.   the greeks and Turks-would publicly confirm a. US announcement about theceasefire at 0700 hrs GMT.   At the time of writing, Turkish Governmenthas done so and the Greek Government is reported to have followed suit.The Foreign Secretary instructed our Ambassadors in Athens and Ankarato propose as soon as the Greeks and Turks had confirmed acceptanceof the ceasefire, a conference to be held in accordance with the -UN resolution in Vienna on 23 July.   We. know that Vienna is acceptable to the Turks, because the Turkish Prime Minister says he docs not want to go too far away from Ankara.-&apos; We do not know whether the greeks will find Vienna acceptable;    there is no inherent reasonSECRET /
why they should not.   Its purpose will of course be first to try to strengthen the extremely&apos;fragile ceasefire and then tomake a start on the difficult and complicated task of achieving a stable solution for Cyprus.11. There will.be problems about how the US, Archbishop&apos; I-Iakaiand other Cypriot leaders should be associated with or particijin the talks.
