;DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 81 COPY NO         g23 July 1974CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1974/75 - 1978/79Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer, We have to settle the public expenditure programmes as the basis for planning, and. for publication of the next White Paper, as soon as wecan.    Our decisions must cover the rate of growth of expenditure as awhole and the allocation of resources between the main programmes.Smaller issues can be settled separately as they arise.2. It is essential that we should take a grip of public expenditure,which is the sector of the economy most directly under our own control,in the face of the threats to stability and social advance posed by inflation and our balance of payments problem.    In allocating the resources whichwe judge we can afford to devote to public purposes we must put firstthose services which contribute to the improvement of our productivecapacity and exports;  assist in reducing the rate of wage increases andthus inflation; or are of special social importance.3. There is no doubt that we must leave room for a substantial proportion of the extra national resources becoming available over thenext few years to improve the balance of trade.    I put this at up toone-fifth of the total or about  400 million a year at present prices.    Theincrease in productive investment, including investment by the nationalised industries, will require nearly a further  500 million a year.On the current estimates of the growth of output, this will leave for therest of public expenditure and personal consumption an increase of 1, 200 million a year, which is only 2 per cent a year.    If public expenditure in demand terms grows at about the rate indicated in the survey report,  700 million or     per cent a year, privately financedconsumption - mostly what wage and salary earners can consume out oftheir own incomes and before allowance for price subsidies - would be leftto grow at only  500 million or if per cent from 1973-79.    Under theTrades Union Congress (TUC) guidelines all this growth would be needed for exceptional cases; take-home pay for the mass of the people would not increase at all in real terms.    To achieve settlements within the TUCguidelines will be difficult at the best of times, within the parameters I have described.    To increase the share of public expenditure beyond theseparameters would mean increasing the tax on earnings to a point whichcould rupture the whole basis of the social contract.
4.        It is true that some public expenditure (notably subsidies, whetherof nationalised industries prices or of food prices) serves to increasewage and salary earners1 consumption; in this sense real take-home pay would be higher.    But unless increases in such components of expenditure are matched by corresponding reductions in other forms of expenditure bythe public sector, taxation would have to be higher, and wage and salaryearners would thus on balance be no better off.    So if for social andeconomic reasons we see an overriding need to increase subsidies, thescope for direct expenditure by Departments and other public bodies iscorrespondingly reduced.    The same applies to any proposals to increaseother transfer payments, like pensions.5.        We have already taken decisions on some of our main priorities andbegun to implement them.    Pensions and other social security benefitshave been greatly increased; we have made housing our first priority inthe field of social services; despite substantial increases Hin prices we arestill subsidising very heavy losses in the nationalised industries;  and weare subsidising essential foods.   Apart from additional house-building bylocal authorities and other public bodies, these expenditures are largelytransfer payments and serve to increase the real personal consumption ofthe recipients.    But as I say, putting these objectives first means thatfewer resources can be made available to meet direct spending by departments.-6.c        Beyond these existing commitments there are very large potentialfinancial commitments in the form of additional social security benefits(the new pension plan, family endowment, aid for one-parent families,the disabled, and so on), and some additional assistance to firms, togetherwith the prospect that we may have to increase price subsidies next yearsubstantially beyond the amounts which have been included in the costing.We cannot tell what the extra claim on resources would be until these itemscan all be costed, but it would be substantial.    The proposals for acquiringindustries or firms and for the community ownership of development land,which have not yet been costed, would not increase direct public sectorclaims on resources.    But they would alter substantially the type of assets,including cash, held by the public and in so far as this increased consumption it would require offsetting action to keep the economy in balance.    Even if wholly in the form of Government stock, the large sumspaid out in compensation would have much the same monetary effects as anincrease in the public sector borrowing requirement.7.        For these reasons my judgment is that the growth of the other programmes which account for most of the direct spending on goods and services must be restricted in total to about the levels in the Survey.    Thusif we decide that one or two have been unduly constrained, we must seekcorresponding savings elsewhere.
8.        I have circulated the report of the Public Expenditure survey committee (PESC) separately.    As we directed, it shows what would bethe best use we could make of provision restricted in the way we indicatedfor the purpose of the report.    It is the necessary, interdepartmentallyagreed, background statement for our task.    The attached note by theTreasury, which includes brief summaries of the position on the main programmes, should help to clarify the issues for decision.9. My recommendations are:a. WeA should agree that the rate of growth of public expenditure should be held close to the rate in the PESC report, ie Z\ per centin demand terms, so that variations in one programme should be offset, to the appropriate extent, by adjustments elsewhere.b. We should set aside for separate decision the followingissues, which involve heavy expenditure and resource use:The level and distribution of nationalised industry subsidies;the level and distribution of food price subsidies;the scale and scope of assistance to industry and the costof nationalisation measures;policy on the community ownership of development land,where the extra call on resources should be minimised;the allocation of resources to defence, when the defence review is completed.c. We should however bear in mind that even the enlargedcontingency reserve for which provision has been made could notaccommodate all these claims, some of which will have to be met,so that pressure on the 2f per cent limit is already intense.d. We should decide whether the scale and distribution of nationalised industries investment is right.e. We should consider whether we need to modify the allocation of resources to the other main programmes on which we have so fartaken no main decisions: education, health, law and order,environmental services, and roads.f. We should decide what our policy is to be on the scale and priorities for additional social security provision.D treasury Chambers23 July 1974
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1973 to 1979WOTE BY THE treasury the issues discussed in this paper are the rate of growth ofpublic expenditure in relation to the prospective growth of output, and the choices between individual programmes and        wservices.   The public expenditure programmes used for thispurpose are those in the 1974 Survey Report, separately circu-lated.   Part I of the Report summarises the position.   Part II,dealing with the individual programmes, is available for reference on more detailed points.2*   To relate the claims of the public sector on resources to the prospects for the economy it is necessary to considerthe broad outlines of the medium term economic assessmentcovering the period 1973 - 1979.   The public expenditure surveyitself covers the years 1974-75 to 1978-79J it provides the forward public expenditure programmes which are embodied inthe medium term economic assessment.   In fact public expend!turin demand terms, grows at about the same rate - around 2^% -in both periods.Public expenditure and the economic -prospect3.   Total domestic output in 1973 amounted to  62,000 million.CONFIDENTIAL
2Chart I shows the distribution of these resources,  togetherwith the external deficit, between the public  and private sectors.    As regards public expenditure,  the chart showsseparately direct purchases of goods and services by thepublic  sector,   including both public consumption and public investment,  and transfers together with subsidies.    The callsof each of these sectors on resources are for this purposemeasured net of flow-back of taxation and of savings -  thatis,   in demand terms;     for each   of expenditure the demandeffect of transfer payments and subsidies is generally somewhat less than that of public consumption and investment other thanin purchases of existing assets.    The demand effects of purchases of existing assets will have been minimal in 1973)and are not separately identified in the chart.    The chartillustrates the division of GDP between the various mainsectors,  the percentage shares being as follows:Per centPrivate investment 11.5Nationalised industries&apos;   investment 2.8Balance.of trade  (goods and services) -  3*public  expenditureDirect purchases of goods and services(a) Public consumption 20.k(b) Public  investment  (other than by      -nationalised industries)Transfers,  subsidies,   etc 12.0Total 37-7Privately-financed consumption 51*6GDP 100.0
4.      Total domestic output is expected to grow between 1973and 1979 by just over 3% a year on average.    This assumes,perhaps optimistically,  that capacity utilization by the endof the 1970s will be similar to that in 1973.5.      The first call on the increment in the nation&apos;s resourcescomes from the balance of trade.    In 197^ the UK&apos;s externaldeficit will be even worse than last year - about  4-g- billionon current account, mainly because of the oil price explosion.Another sizeable deficit is in prospect for 1975*      m6.      The Government1s declared policy is to cover this deficit for the time being by borrowing.    However,  it would be veryoptimistic to assume that international lenders will be willingto go on meeting substantial deficits indefinitely withoutexacting increasingly onerous terms,   if at all.    Moreover,continued borrowing would mean steadily mounting debt servicepayments;    even if external balance is restored by 197o-79j  the debt service will offset a substantial proportion - possibly asmuch as half - of our average net import saving on oil in thoseyears.    At some later time too we may have to repay at leastpart of the principal on top Of the annual interest charges;the larger our cumulative indebtedness the more burdensome thiswould clearly be. 7/7*      For these reasons it is essential to aim for a steadyreduction in the external deficit.    This in turn implies that
the  forward planning; ol   the nation&apos;h  resumeom rimhI.  jirov i di;for a substantial rise in exports,  and also in imjjortsubstitution (part of which would take the form of import saving on oil).    A return to external balance by 1978-79 wouldoh present estimates imply an average annual resources shiftinto the balance of payments of the order of one-fifth of theincrease in GDP.8.       The other prior call on new resources is for productive investment,   including that undertaken by the nationalised industries,  in order to sustain the growth of our GDP.9-      Assuming the overseas acoount to be restored to balanceby 1978-79.  these two prior calls  (balance of trade and productive investment) would account for nearly half of thenew resources becoming available by 1979-    This can be seen in Chart 2, which illustrates the allocation of new resourcesbecoming available between 1973 and 1979*    The other half or so of new resources represents the increment that is availablefor all other purposes - the public sector and personal consumption;    and Chart 2 shows how much of this would be absorbed by public  expenditure,  assuming the programmes to Ibe those of the 197^ Survey and distinguishing,  as in Chart 1,between direct purchases of goods and services  (includingpublic investment and public consumption)  and transfers and subsidies.4
510.      Chart 3 shows the resulting distribution of totalresources by the  end of the period,   1979*  by adding theincrements shown in Chart 2,  sector by sector,  to thedistribution with which we started in Chart  1  for 1973.The balance of payments deficit  is eliminated;    productive investment,  public  and private,   is expanded relativelyquickly;    consumption is expanded less quickly,   though within this sector the fastest increase is that of consuinptionfinanced by State benefits and pensions and by subsidies.11.      The public  expenditure programmes reflected in thesecharts do not provide specifically for expenditures on new policies for community ownership of development land or forthe extension of public ownership in industry;     and the existiprovisions for such purchases of assets are not  significant inthe period.    Public purchases of land,   existing buildings andother assets normally have a relatively weak effect in demand terms.     Even large increases in such expenditure would notnecessarily have large demand effects,  and they do not ofcourse directly increase public sector claims on resources.Their effects are on the monetary system and are equivalentto increases in the public  sector borrowing requirement.12.      Underlying the charts.the figures of the size andandgrowth of GDP/of each sector of the economy,  as these emerge
from the medium term economic assessment and the 197^public expenditure Survey,  are summarised in the      attachedtable.     It -will be seen that  total public  expenditure growsat 2.7% a year and within this transfers and subsidies at.8%.    Resources available for consumption out of families&apos;incomes  (after tax and insurance contributions  and beforefromtaking account of help /    subsidies or from income from Statepensions and benefits -  &quot;privately financed consumption&quot; -)would grow by about  1.5% a year.13.      The charts and the table display the fact that,  if alarger increase is desired for any sector,  it can be securedonly by reducing that of another.    In particular,  privately-financed personal consumption would be growing much moreslowly than the natioff1 s     output.    Would this  situationprompt irresistible pressure for higher incomes in jrder tosecure greater consumption?    If so,  there would be the lessavailable for other sectors.    Where would that sacrifice thenbe made to fall1?lk.      The most direct available way of reducing pressure for higher incomes is price subsidies.    But if these have to be financed out of additional taxation they reduce take-homepay at the same time and thus leave wage and salary earners  Ino better off,  on balance;    and if the additional taxation is
to bo avoided,  we come back to reducing demands on resources15.      Viewed in this way the rate of growth of public  expend-iture implied in the programmes of the 197^ Survey may alreadybe above the highest substainable level for the period.General assessment of public expenditure programmesl6. Decisions on some of the major priorities for the public sector have already been taken:(a) In social security,  the  10/ l6 pension and related benefits, with the corresponding increases in national insurance contributions are being implemented.     several other major improvements, eg for family endowment, oneparent families and the disabled, have been proposedwhich together would require heavy extra expenditure.Development of the contributory pension scheme in the longer term is also planned, with the further intentionof floating pensioners off supplementary benefits.(b) A large increase in local authority house-building is to be stimulated, and so is a substantial programme ofpublic acquisition and municipalisation.   The estimates of housing subsidies show very large increases, and fundshave been provided to stabilise mortgage rates.7
CONFIDENTIAL(c) The milk subsidy has been increased and other food subsidies have been introduced to help moderate wage increases; on present estimates these subsidies areexpected to cost some  430 million in 1974-75.(d) Nationalised industry prices, despite recent and prospective increases, are still inmost cases below costs and the subsidy bill is estimated at  860 million for1974-75.   Most of it is for price restraint; the rest ofthe subsidies are paid for social reasons, notably to therailways and, on a reducing scale, to the coal industry,(These figures do not however allow for the cost ofcompensation to pneumoconiosis victims, likely to beabout  100 million.)-(e)   In order to assist the employment situation in the regions and - through export prices - to help the trade balance, the Regional Employment Premium has beendoubled at an additional cost of about  120 million in afull year.(f)   As explained above, the subsidies on food, housing and nationalised industry services, increase personal consumption and demand, and thus have implications for taxation.17,   Special attention has been given to certain programmes which were not subject to the general constraint on directexpenditure on resources in 1975-76.   The investment programmes of the nationalised industries have been examined case by case,8
9CONFIDENTIALtaking into account the need to provide for adequate expansionof the productive base of the economy, where this criterionapplies, e.g. energy, steel.   Elsewhere, e.g. railways, thebasis of the assessment is less clear cut and there is morescope for adjustment.18.   Some forms of assistance to industry involve commitments which cannot be cut once the project has been launched -e.g, Concorde or the RB 211 aeroengine; or the Channel Tunnelif we go beyond the present phase; general systems of payments to industry or agriculture, such as regional development grants or Commodity support schemes are liable to substantialvariations in cost and, though the cost can be affected bypolicy changes, these tend to be slow to take effect.19.   The figures for defence in the Survey show a purelyconventional projection at the 197^-75 level, which is wellbelow the estimated cost of maintaining the existing size and structure of the Armed Forces.    The provision to be madewill depend on the decisions to be taken following thedefence review. ?20.   The remaining large programmes are those which make bigdemands on public service manpower and capital construction:health, education, law and order, local environmental servicesand roads.   It is therefore in these programmes that theconstraint on direct spending on resources in 1975-76,
confidential for the preparation of the Survey costings, applied to a major degree.21.   Provision is made in the forward costings for a contin-gency reserve rising to  1,000 million in 19/q-79.   But inthe next year or two alone there are very large potentialcommitments.   These include further price subsidies, both on food and nationalised industry services; social securityimprovements; and policies for industry and development land.The total costs cannot at present he estimated but they would run into   hundreds of millions.22.   To assist Ministers in deciding on remaining priorities and the division of resources between the programmes, briefnotes are attached for the larger programmes.   These noteshave been produced by the Treasury on the basis of the materialused in the Survey report.10CONFIDENTIAL

A reportby officials will be ready in July.   Ministers will then be asked totake decisions in principle.   Following consultations with our Alliesdecisions will be announced in the autumn.   To avoid prejudging the outcome of the Review the Survey report shows for all years after197U-75 provisional defence budget figures which repeat the 1974-75Estimates total of  3612 million (line (1) above).2,    These provisional figures would, if adhered to, reduce the Bhareof GNP going to defence from 5?% in 1974-75 to around h?% in 1983-84. .But the Long Term Costings shown in line (2), which measure the costof maintaining and equipping forces of broadly the present size and structure, would entail not merely an increase in the absolute size ofthe defence budget but a small increase in the GNP percentage aboveits present level.   In the Defence Review a,number of options are being examined to see what changes in the size and structure of the forces would be required to achieve different levels of savings as comparedwith the Long Term Costings.3,    The issues we have to decide are what to spend on defence infuture to maintain our security as part of the NATO alliance, and how to reduce our contribution to the level of those of our wealthierEuropean allies.   This will Involve Borne difficult decisions.   Forexample, the elimination of all our overseas commitments outside NATOwill save no more than  110 million a year so that significant reduc-tions in the sea, land and air forces committed to NATO will certainly be needed to meet even the least severe target we have set ourselves.ISSEC RE T

The pattern may be influenced by e.c. renegotiation but if we wereto withdraw? domestic support wcild probably have to be increased tomake up for the loss of CAP support.3.     Expenditure .on farm support depends on unpredictable things,especially the level of food prices in the rest of the world.     Thereis too much uncertainty to make forecasts worthwhile.     Instead thefigures rest on an assumed level of prices from 1975-76 onwards -slightly lower than this year.     In fact exienditure in those yearsmay well be higher.     This year, special temporary measures have beenneeded to help the pig and beef sectors and this kind of thing mayhave to be done again.

TRADE INDUSTRY AND EMPLOYMENT yfhie is a mixture of very different items - ranging from Concorde andthe space programme to &quot;job centres&quot; (the modernised Labour Exchanges),and industrial training.     It includes export credit;   help for lamecluck shipyards;   support for capital investment in the regions;   andindustrial research.

Again, crises of the Rolls-Royce type may force the Government into unforeseen expenditure. ,.),    Forecasts for this programme always show a fall over the 5 year period but expenditure seldom falls in practice.     It is no more likelyto do so now than in the past.     Existing programmes (eg Concorde, RB 211and the reconstruction of various shipyards) tail off and new projects,which will surely come forward as time goes on, do not yet show up in thefigures.     Another reason for the apparent fall is that it, has been assumed that the banks will take a growing share of the burden ofproviding net new finance for exports;   but this is very uncertain.-V.      7-      7..1 I .4.

ijjKALlSED INDUSTRIES - CAPITAL EXPENDITUREGeneral.    The nationalised industry investment programmes are largelyirned by market requirements.   Their programmes have not been constrainedformula, but have been examined in the light of commercial prospects and pr contribution as applicable to the nation&apos;s productive capacity andjut there is a problem of estimating and control arising from shortfallapital spending.    To deal with this, industries programmes have beenfully scrutinised to try- to make the figures realistic; and in additionortfall allowance of  150 million has been written in for 1975-76, andmillion for every other year.   Total expenditure by nationalisedstries on fixed assets is likely to rise from  2,075 million in 1973,-74B,530 million in 1975-76&apos; (from the artificially low level of 1974-75)to  2,760 million in 1978-79.The Energy programme grows from  810 million in 1973-74 to  1,130 million(975-76 to  1,200 million in 1978-79.   There will be increased investmentimplement the NCB&apos; 8 Plan for Coal, and for the distribution of naturalsfrom the Prigg and Brent fields.   Electricity remains the fastest growingitor; but the figures have been reduced this year to take account of a dropforecast demand for electricity and a change in the mix of nuclear andisil-fuel power stations.The&apos;Steel programme will rise from  185 m, in 1973-74 to  366 m, in[5-76 and to  380 million in 1978-79 as the BSC s Capital Developmentjgramme goes ahead.   It may be necessary to alter the programme after theliew of closure plans have been completed.   The bulk of Post Officerestment is for telecommunications.   Expenditure in 1974-75, which washave been cut 20% on the figures in last year&apos;s White Paper, is now onlyibelow.   The new level has been agreed in order to cushion the industryiits suppliers and is about as much as the Corporation can spend thisT. The programme for later years has been reshaped so that previousgramme levels can be reached by 1976-77.British Railways&apos; investment is shown in the Survey report to grow fromlO million in 1973-74 to  300 million in 1978-79.   The figures (exceptase for the Channel Tunnel rail link) are lower by 20% in 1974-75, 15$1975-76 and 10% in succeeding years than the previous White Paper, sinceinvestment does not meet the criteria above,   DOE have suggested to theiUsh Railways Board that they should plan on the basis of the reducedSures; and the Treastiry aoes not propose that they should be furtherduced.

NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES - SUBSIDIES1.     As a result of the price increases announced in the Budget,we expected to cut hack this year&apos;s subsidy bill for the nationalised industries from the figure of  1,400 million which would have resultedwithout any price increases to about  500 million. Nearly half ofthis represented a continuing requirement of support for BritishRail for social reasons; most of the remainder representedtemporary measures of compensation for price restraint, primarily for the Electricity Boards.2.    By the end of June the estimate of  500 million had to be revised upward again to  800 million.     The Post Office are likelyto want  170 million more than the previous estimate (partly because of  40 million disallowed from their price increases by thePrice Commission,) the electricity industry  50 million more andthe railways a further  20 million.     The Coal Board are also likelyto need more either from price increases or subsidies - quite apartfrom the special payment of nearly  100 million for the pneumoconiosiscompensation scheme; the arrangements for financing this have still to be finally settled.3.    As there can be no scientific means,of anticipating the outcome,-/provision has been made in this public expenditure survey for  500 million in 1975-76 (a repetition of the figure originallyplanned for the current year) and in subsequent years for littlemore than continuing operating subsidies of about  300 million for ,the railways.     But these projections make heroic assumptions aboutthe price increases which will be allowed..   A review of nationalised industry prices is now taking place, with particular attention toenergy, prices but not confined to them, and this will provide a basis for decisions on the next round of price increases.     But in general.,over the survey period as a whole, unless prices are allowed to risereasonably in line with costs, the subsidy bill could easily escalatefar above the current level, and could virtually pre-empt the contingency reserve.4.    The issue in this field is the continuing conflict between the objective of holding down prices and the objective of containing thesubsidy bill and restoring a viable economic regime for the nationalised industries.

CONFIDENTIALCOMMUNITY OWNERSHIE OF DETELGH1ENT LANDMinisters are working upon a scheme for the compulsory acquisition by local authorities of land required for develop-ment, subject to a transitional period in which local authorities would have a power but not a duty to acquire.,    The initial basisof compensation is still under discussion.   Disposals to theprivate sector will be at current market value,.2.     There is no provision for the scheme in the present public expenditure forecasts, though the implications for public sectorfinancing will be considerable.    Important aspects of thearrangements remain to be decided and there&apos;.is much uncertainty about how it will work in practice.    Thus&apos;the magnitudes of thefinancial effects are open to wide margins of error.   Therewould be savings in existing programmes on which provision ismade for the acquisition of land for public purposes, because ofthe lower prices which would be paid for it.   Acquisition for private sector development would add to public expenditure in the interim years before disposal brings large receipts.   As well as these public expenditure effects there would be a progressively;reduced tax yield from the lower values received by owners ofland.5:.     On the figures currently in use, the net effect (expenditure,cost of borrowing and administration, and taxation) for thepublic sector might be a substantial, cumulative, deficit positionup to and including year 8 after the introduction of the scheme,with a substantial surplus position thereafter.4.    Public acquisition of development land will not add to continue resources at all.   The extent of the net extra demand on resources will depend mainly on how gains are shared between central and local government and the users of public services,on the reactions of landowners deprived of development gains,plus the additional manpower needed to operate the scheme.n
housing in 1972/73 housing expenditure was about  2,000 million.This year it is estimated at nearly  3,100 million.     So in tv/oyears it has jumped by  1,000 million.     The main increases incluimuch higher subsidies for council tenants (as a result, not of netpolicy, but of higher interest and other costs) and higher capita]investment in new housebuilding by local authorities.     But new policies adopted for this year to meet election pledges, suchas the rent freeze, municipalisation and greater encouragement of local authority building, have added nearly&apos; 300 million and.ilhave inevitable consequences in future years as well.&apos;2.     Large and difficult issues arise on this programme.     Thetemporary lending to building societies will very likely not krepaid in full in 1974/75 and in the coming months the choice between further large outlays and letting the mortgage rate, risemay well be faced&quot;again.     Whether this is done by loan or bysubsidy the benefit goes to those who are buying their house on mortgage,I3. It may be that the continuation in subsequent years of the policies adopted for 1974/75 (more local authority building,encouragement of municipalisation - with related subsidies ^ andextra provision for housing associations)cannot in large part be avoided, but there are question marks: can we afford yet more from 1975/76 onwards for increasing municipalisation as well aBfor the housing association movement through the Housing Corporal!4. Recent decisions have settled policy on council rents overthe next 2-3 years. But when the longer term review is set on foot the new scale of housing expenditure must prompt the questswhether council tenants and owner occupiers should be expectedto devote a larger proportion of their income to meet their ownhousing costs.5. Thus following the big jump in public housing.expenditureihas taken place this year there are impending major issues involrtcapital finance and consumer subsidies.- uCONFIDENTIAL

OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICESWater and SewerageThese services are now the responsibility of the Regional Water Autho:ties in England and Wales.   Investment in water and sewerage facilityis being^reduced in 1974-75 and, as projected, does not approach the1973-74 level until 1976-77. hut over the nine years to 1978-79 theannual rate of growth shown is about 4 per cent.   The provision will leave no room for improving standards and it will be difficult toensure that domestic and industrial needs are met with it.Local Environmental services .   This is largely local authority expenditure on refuse , disposal,recreation, town and country planning and local administration.3.   Current expenditure on these services increases over the survey period at 5 per cent a year and the Departments are doubtful whetherthis will permit existing standards to be kept while allowing forincreased demand arising from population and other changes.4.   The Department of the Environment do not believe that the provi-sifor capital expenditure, significantly reduced in 1974-75 and broadly speaking held constant over the Survey period, will be enough to accommodate the demands of the increased housing programme.   perhaps a third of the programme is not related to housing construction.Capital expenditure on these services forms only part of a wider poolwithin which local authorities have freedom to determine their ownpriorities.   While it is true that public sector housebuilding is increasing, this is at present being more than offset by reducedprivate sector activity.   The question therefore is whether there is sufficient margin in the provision to allow for foreseeable expansion in the two sectors taken together over the next year or so.5*   The question that arises on this block as a whole is whetherthe provision made is sufficient to meet (a) essential demandassociated with housing and [t) a reasonable level of amenity.30

LOCAL AUTHORITY CURRENT EXPENDITUREThis block of spending by local government amounts to around  6,000million a year, or about 16 per cent of total public expenditure;the greater part of it (60.5 per cent in England and Wales) isfinanced by the Rate Support Grant from central government.   This is^not a functional block but an amalgam of expenditures included inthe functional programmes.   Throughout the sixties and early seventiesit increased more rapidly than public expenditure\ire as a whole, andits share of GDP rose from 6,6 per cent in 1960 to 13.5 per cent, in1973.2,   This expenditure is subject to influence notably&apos;throughDepartmental circulars and the amount of Rate Support Grant, but itis not controlled.   Indeed in each of the last two years expenditure has exceeded the programmed level by some 3 per cent, making a total annual growth rate of about 8 per cent.   Another excess is certainthis year.3. The immediate need is to bring home to local authorities thatthey will have &quot;to restrict their spending in 1975-76, The Secretaryof State for the Environment has this in hand. This is importantbecause the authorities are entering into commitments now which will raise their expenditure next year. The excess over the programmethis year will in any case make it harder to get expenditure into line with the Survey next year, ?k.   Whatever may come out of the enquiry into local government finance, decisions on expenditure in 1975-76 will have to be takenin the context of the existing arrangements for the finance andcontrol of local expenditure.   In dealing with Rate Support Grant there is a conflict of objectives.   The problem is to balance the desire to pay more grant, in order to shield ratepayers, againstthe need to restrict grant, in order to moderate local spending.32

LAW,  ORDER AND PROTECTIVE services.      The reductions required to meet the Cabinet limits amount to 60m for 1975/76.    S.k3m is found by reducing the capital programme,2. The reduced provision for the court building programme woulddefer the completion of a number of higher and lower courts for afurther year.3. The police building programme ( 45m in 197^/75) at its reduceilevel -would push into 1975/76 the starts on local authority scheme!deferred from 197^/75, and the effect would continue beyond theperiod. The prison building programme ( 29.8m in 197^/75)* even a:reduced, would still provide 1,400 extra places a year on average;and provided the prison population does not again increasesubstantially, a start could be made in the period on reconstructiisome Victorian prisons and,  over the next 10 years,  closing othersik.      The remaining  17m of the required reductions is found from current expenditure which,, however, would still1 be on a risingtrend in each service.    In administration of justice the cause ,of the rise is the increasing amount of business (both civil and criminal) coming before the courts and the increasing ,proportion involving legal aid.    In the prison, probation andafter care, and police services, the rise is largely due to increasing staff.    Police manpower, both uniformed and civilian,is projected, in line with recent experience, to be recruitedmore slowly than on the previous plans.    Later information thanin the Survey report shows that for 1975/76 Immigration and central Services staff together would be at or slightly above the197V75 level. -

Almost all the programme effectively represents thepurchase of goods and services, about two-thirds of the total beingdevoted to expenditure on staff.2.      he prior commitment for the education programme is the obligeation to make proper provision for children of compulsory schoolage.     Beyond this, the issue is that of determining the rate at-which improvements should be made in (i) provision for those of compulsory school age, particularly in pupil/teacher ratios, and(ii) other aspects of education, including in particular replacemeiof old school buildings, nursery education, and provision forincreased numbers of students in further and higher education,3. At present, roughly half of the total provision (both for capital and current expenditure) is devoted to compulsory schoolingThe broad approach of the Education Ministers in laying butresources to the best advantage has been first to ensure that therswill he places for all schoolchildren, and to provide for steadilyimproving pupil/teacher ratios throughout the period, so that all,newly trained teachers will be taken into employment.    -4.    The main issue is the rate of improvement in. other aspects.,,The remaining half of the programme covers continuation of the planned expansion of nursery education (after 1975-76 in Englandand Vales), and that of further education and the universitiesthough at a slower rate than previously planned.     The latterinvolves some risk that, &quot;by 1977-78* there may not he sufficientplaces for all those applicants qualified for higher education who wish to pursue it.    The provision for replacing and improving old1 I/&apos; .        ......schools is substantially lower than previously planned.

-   . SECRETHEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL SERVICES1C The &quot;basic issues are how limited resources of money and staffcan best he directed, and which priority groups have the strongesclaims for improvements in services.2.   Generally the present policy is to give a higher priority toimprovements in staff than to improvements in buildings, and to the balance of care from the hospitals towards the community,\\3.   A requirement of very high priority is to meet the increasingpressures resulting from demographic factors, in particular the growing numbers of old people.   Another immediate pressure is to staff new buildings,&apos;&apos;which generally require more staff.,andincorporate substantial improvements.   For the hospital and commiiservices a growth rate of 1i-2 per cent a year is required to matthese pressures.   Of this perhaps half represents in some sensehigher standards.   For the personal social services 2 per cent ayear is required to staff new buildings.   The programme as presetfor the former provides for 2% per cent between 1974-75 and 1975-and 3 per cent a year thereafter: and for the latter 6 per cent ayear (compared with over 9 per cent in recent years).4*   There is, therefore, a relationship between the size) of capitprogrammes and the proportion of the provision for improvement iifuture recurrent, expenditure which they would pre-empt.   TheGovernment inherited a reduced capital programme.   Continued atthe 1974-75 level this would provide for some 8,000 new hospitalbeds by 1980, while still enabling a measure of priority to begiven to smaller schemes, e.g. health centres, and to particular groups, including the mentally handicapped,5. Plans for family practitioner services are not modified. Thjmain issue on these services is the priority to be given to redulcharges as compared with improvements in other services.&apos; :&apos;   &apos;

The first priority was raising national insurance pensions to 10/16 at the earliest practicable moment and promising pensionupratings annually in line with earnings.    The issues now concernchoice of the next priorities and their phasing: possible ^individualdevelopments range in Exchequer cost from around  10 million a yearto several   hundred millions.3.   Ministers have to consider whether to make a Christmas bonusnext winter (for the third year running, and so perhaps for everafter); they are committed to reviewing in effect whether pensions should be uprated twice in 1975.   There is also a firm commitment.tta new system of family support, with allowances for all children; -but there is a range of choice about amounts and cost.   This, choicein turn will be strongly Influenced by whether there is to be anincrease in family allowances next spring, and if so in what form,A further commitment is the introduction in about three year&apos;s timeof a new long term pension scheme.    Smaller but still substantial imatters are new levels of disregards for supplementary benefits and improvements in death and maternity benefits.   Others, with largerpotentialities, are a new. system of benefit for single-parent families and new help for the disabled.4.    The essential problem is to strike a balance between the objectiof improved social security benefits as an element in the social contract, and for itself; and the; economic and social costs ofproviding it by imposing extra charges on the incomes of the - workiiifpopulation, or raising prices through charges on employers.
