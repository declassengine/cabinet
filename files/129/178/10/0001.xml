C(74) 8531 July 1974CABINETNUCLEAR TESTINGNote by the Prime Minister1.        I was asked in Cabinet on 27 June (CC(74) 21st Conclusions,Minute 3) whether a paper could be prepared about the reason for holding the recent test in America and the way in which the decision was taken.    It was agreed that I would discuss the matter further withthe Ministers most closely concerned and that there would then be areport to the Cabinet.2. The decision to hold the test was taken by the last administration and the timetable was set.    We had to decide whether to interfere withthe arrangements.    I discussed this on 5 April with the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Defence and for the following reasons decidedthat the test should go ahead as planned.3. We knew from technical assessment of all the available information on the nature and rate of development of Soviet anti-missiledefence development that our missiles would have to be given betterpenetration capability if we wished to retain a credible deterrent.    this could be done without so-called MIRVing, but it does involve sometesting.4. Once the need for a test was established and accepted, the timingwas governed by a tight logistic programme for modification of themissile and the need to fit it into the American test programme inNevada - we having no underground test site of our own.    If we had decided not to allow this test to go ahead as planned, the slippage in time would have increased the cost in the event that, as a result of the defence review, it is decided to make this improvement.5. We also specifically agreed that the decision to hold this test was without prejudice to the policy decision of whether to retain our nuclear deterrent which would be taken in the context of the defence review.1TOP  secret the circulation of this paper has been strictly Jinrited?It is issued for the personal use oi.

TOP secret .        There is a long-standing convention that sensitive questions inthe field of foreign affairs, defence matters and on s ecurity/intelligenceare not necessarily brought before the Cabinet for decision.    A small group of Ministers sometimes have to assume responsibility, althoughclearly policies (where these are involved) could not be pursued if itturned out that the Cabinet as a whole did not support them.7.        The 1965 test was not discussed in Cabinet.    The decision to hold the recent test was not a policy decision.    A decision not to hold it would however have been a policy decision because it would have prejudiced the effective fulfillment, in terms of time and money, of one of the optionswhich we may wish to take.8.        As I have said there will be no need for a further British testbefore we decide, in the context of the defence review, on our futuredefence policy as a whole.    If the strategic nuclear deterrent is thenretained and if for exceptional reasons we felt unable on any futureoccasion to hold a Cabinet discussion in advance of a British test it wouldbe my intention to inform the Cabinet as soon as possible after the testhad taken place so that they would know the position before there was anypublicity.H W10 Downing Street31 July 1974IP
