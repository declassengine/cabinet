INTRODUCTION TO WHITE PAPER ON INDUSTRYBritain&apos;s wealth and&apos; welfare &quot;ultimately depends on all thosewho work in manufacturing industry.   The strength and structure of our industry is therefore a matter of great national concern.This white Paper proposes measures to encourage its re-equipment and expansion within the framework of a mixed economy, comprisingpublic enterprise and a vigorous and successful private sec:tor&apos;each of which has an important part to play.2      Since the war britain&apos;s record as a manufacturing nationhas &quot;been one of disappointment.   Por social, economic and industrialreasons we have &quot;been unable as a nation to harness tlie immense-resources of skill and ability at all levels of society, andas a result have been falling further behind our competitorsand doing far less well than we could have done and could do.Success or failure tends to be reinforcing and as the gap widensit can become progressively more difficult to bridge.   the investment and new industrial relationships needed to sustainour living standards can become more difficult to secure.3      In 1971? investment for each worker in British manufacturing industry was less than half that in Prance, Japan or the UnitedStates and well below that in Germany or Italy.   In spite ofthe measures to encourage investment taken since then it has still lagged behind.   Moreover, when it comes to making effective use of our manufacturing equipment we are less successful thanmost of our competitors.   Investment at home on the scale requiredhas not taken place and funds which ought to have gone into our
own industry have been deployed elsewhere.   In the last tenyears the rate of direct investment by British firms overseashas more than trebled and, even when allowance is made for.changes in the value of money, this represents a substantial -diversion of resources. .4      Successive governments have striven to correct thesedeficiemesboth by general economic measures and by increasinginvolvement in industry.   This experience is not unique tothis country; it has been shared by many other western democracies.But all too often the involvement has &quot;been a response to thedifficulties of particular companies rather than part of eJicoherent industrial strategy.   The Government take the viewthat.if we are to be successful in developing our mixed economywe must evolve institutions that will bring about a closerand better defined relationship between Government and industry.5      The Government therefore propose to create two newinstruments: a system of Planning Agreements with major firms and separately a National Enterprise Board to extend publicenterprise into the manufacturing sector of industry.   Inaddition, the Government are coming forward with proposals forthe extension of public ownership based on the programme set outin their election manifesto.   These include development land, theestablishment of the British National Oil Corporation, the.nationalisation of the shipbuilding and aircraft industries, theextension of the public sector in\&apos;.. the road haulage industry and construction industry and schemes for bringing commercial ports-.-----\
and cargo handling-activities under public ownership and control.6      The Planning Agreements system and the National EnterpriseBoard have separate&apos; and complementary roles- to play in achieving the Government1 s objectives.   The basic aim of planning agreements is to bring about a closer understanding betweencompanies,workers, and Government moving towards a harmonisationof their plans.   The information which companies provide willbe used for this purpose only.   The National Enterprise board will provide the means for direct public initiatives in particularkey sectors of manufacturing industry.   The Board will in additionto extending public ownership take over the ownership of shareswhich the Government already hold in a number of companies; itwill be a new source of investment capital for state participation in manufacturing industry; and it will act as the Government&apos;sagent in the efficient restructuring of industry.   It will alsohelp companies in difficulties and will pay close attention to regional development opportunities.   Por many of its activitiesthe Board.will be able to build on the experience of the formerIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation.7      The Government want to develop relationships which will encourage improvements in the performance of the whole economy,to promote a higher quantity and quality of investment and.to achieve a better return on that investment.   This must be seenagainst1 the background of the Government1 s social and economicgoals.   By. entering into explicit partnership with manufacturing industry the Government expect to improve the quality of
management, develop industrial democracy and move towards jointcompany planning within an orderly development of the economy.8      These proposals for a National Enterprise Board and planning Agreements will he presented to Parliament in a new industry Bill and as the need arises, appropriate changes willalso &quot;be proposed in company law.1 August, 1974*
