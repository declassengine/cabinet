PUBLIC EXPENDITURE-GENERAL REVIEWINTRODUCTIONThe Cabinet decided in April that this report should show the best policies judged capable of achievement within prescribed- expenditure limits limits which were not always quantitative, andwhich allowed important variations for certainprogrammes. (A detailed statement of the limitswithin which the Report has been constructed isset out in Annex A.) This means that the figuresfor a number of major programmes for the yearsafter 1974-75 are not derived from policy to-date,which has been the basis for all past surveys, butsimply represent the outcome of an externally im-posed constraint. The policies shown here, are,therefore, different both in content and status fromthose of the previous Administration^ last public expenditure White Paper, Cmnd. 5519.2. Within these terms of reference, the Report isinterdepartmentally agreed at official level. But(apart from 1974-75) no Minister is committedeither to the overall totals, or to the expenditurelevels or policy content of the programmes.THE NATURE OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE3. The figures need to be considered in two separately -ate but closely inter-related dimensions:(a) By economic category (capital investment,current expenditure on goods and services,transfers to the private sector, etc.) because,while virtually all forms of public expendi-ture have an impact on the economy interms of demand for real resources, thev impact differs for different economic cate-gories. Figures for 1974-75, 1975-76 and1978-79, showing expenditure at constant prices, divided approximately into certainbroad economic categories, are shown inTable 1.(b) By functional programme, each programmecovering a broad area of Government activ-ity, because it is in these terms that policyaims and achievements ,are , expressed.Figures by programme for 1974-75 and1978-79 are set out in Table 2. ; ?

In considering these figures a number of parti-cular points need to be borne in mind.(i) Expenditure on goods and services, capitalor current, makes a direct claim on resourcesby the public authority concerned.(ii) Some but not all nationalised industryinvestment expands the country&apos;s industrialbase, and thus the productive capacity of the economy. This fact is important for deter-mining the level of such investment. account has also to be taken of the commercial objec-tives of the industries. But because they aresustained in the last resort by the Exchequer,and are not subject to the ultimate discipline of the private sector viz. the ability tosurvive in a competitive situation Ministersmust settle the scale of their investment ona broad judgment of the priority to be givento the claims it makes on the economy, com-pared with other competing claims.(iii) Other capital expenditure by trie public sectordoes not necessarily bring savings in current expenditure on the contrary, the expansionof the social infrastructure usually increases the need for manpower and other currentresources. It is true that this leads to anincrease in the welfare in the communityarising from the particular programmes ex-panded, but only at the cost of reducingthe rate of growth of either other public expenditure or private consumption.(iv) Transfer payments are redistributive in their effect. They have important implications forthe economy. Although they do not add to direct demand on resources by public sector authorities, they do add to the demand of the recipients. A decision to increasetransfer payments, not offset by cuts inother public expenditure, is thus a decision that spending by one group of people shouldbe restricted in favour of spending by another; with the implication that, if inflationis to be restrained, and if people cannot be induced to increase their saving, then taxa-tion is the only means available to effect the transfer.5. The decisions to be taken against the back-ground provided by the Report are fundamentallydecisions on resource allocation. It is in this contextsignificant that different types of expenditure differ inthe degree of demand they make on real resources.These different effects can be broadly quantified,and the expenditure figures adjusted accordingly.When so adjusted, expenditure of all kinds can beadded together to express total demand on resources,and this is a relevant measure in a discussion ofresource allocation. The average rate of increasein public expenditure in these terms between1974-75 and 1978-79 implied in this Report isabout 2f per cent.SECRET
i&apos; ftMain ReportSECRET6. There is, however, another way in which expen-diture has to be considered in relation to manage-ment of the economy. All expenditure, whether on goods and services, transfers, or purchases of assets,involves cash payments by the public sector, and,other things (e.g. taxation) being equal, adds to thepublic sector borrowing requirement. The size and composition of that borrowing requirement affects the balance of the economy through monetary policy; and in some circumstances it may have important implications for international confidence.ECONOMIC PROSPECTS7. Broad decisions about the planned rate of ex-expansion of public expenditure programmes require a view about the extent to which they can be ac-commodated without frustrating other importanteconomic objectives of the Government. Such aview involves putting on one side short term economic fluctuations and concentrating on the longer term underlying trends e.g. the growth of productive potential while recognising that plansrelated to such trends will need from time to timeto be adjusted for short term reasons.8. It is not possible in this Report to give quanti-tative expression to the relationship between public expenditure and the other major aggregates in themacro-economic picture, because this will depend onthe nature of the economic strategy which the Gov-ernment decide to pursue. However, the indications are that, if public expenditure grew at the relativelymodest rate implied in this Report, the rate at whichprivately-financed consumption could be allowed to grow would still have to be constrained well belowthe growth of GDP.THE BROAD PICTURE9. At constant prices and in volume terms* theaverage annual rate of growth of public expenditure as set out in this Report would be 2-4f per cent.Tables 1 and 2 give the figures for the years at thebeginning and end of the period under review, and table 3 gives the figures for a run of past and future years.* Public expenditure figures can be expressed in a number of ways, the appropriate form depending upon the use to whichthey are being put. Figures in &quot; volume terms &quot; provide ameasure of changes over time in the scale of provision of services under each programme, or in total public sectoractivity. Expenditure control is in general carried out by using such figures (although the degree of control exercisableby the central government is not uniform e.g. central govern-ment influence oh local authority current expenditure is very limited). All the programme tables in Part 2 of this report are therefore presented in &quot;volume terms&quot;. Figures in&quot; volume terms&quot; do not, however, provide an adequatemeasure of the changing cost of programmes, which can onlybe shown by using figures in &quot; cost terms&quot;, including the&quot; relative price effect&quot; see paragraph 22 below.10.  The totals for each year are as follows:  million at 1974 Survey prices1974 1975 1976 1977 1978-75     -76     -77     -78     -79Year on year per-centage increasefAverage annual per-centage increasef36,762 37,504 38,164 39,163 40,3022-2     1-8     2-7     2-92-4.11. Within the 2-4f per cent growth of the total,different kinds of expenditure would of coursemove differently. Direct expenditure on goods and services (which is over half the total) would grow at - 5 per cent: and within that capital investment, at-8 per cent, would grow faster than current ex-penditure. Partly because of some of the assump-tions referred to in footnote f below, transfers, onthe other hand (excluding debt interest), would onlygrow by 0-8 per cent, although within that, currentgrants to persons would grow at 2 - 8 per cent, whilecurrent grants abroad would grow at 11-4 per centJPUBLIC EXPENDITURE THEPROGRAMMES12. Rates of growth are measured from 1974-75for two reasons. First, because all change in thefuture has to be change from the present, so thatthe present position is a natural starting point.Secondly, because the 1974-75 figures reflect thedecisions of the present administration, taken at or about Budget time, on expenditure in that year.Nevertheless, it is important to remember that some though not all programmes had been reducedmore than once under the previous administration,and that some of the present 1974-75 figures aretherefore lower than had at one time been planned.The extent of this may be seen in Annex B.13. On the basis of the expenditure constraintswithin which this Report has been prepared thehighest rate of growth, in programme terms, amongthe major programmes would occur in nationalised Iindustries&apos; capital investment, expected to grow atj5-3 per cent. The largest programme in absolute terms Social Security would grow at 2-6 per cent,although this figure is sensitive to the assumptionwhich has to be made about the growth of real earnings over the period. Education would growat 3-8 per cent and Health at 3-2 per cent. only two main programmes Agriculture, and Trade,Industry and Employment would show an appreci-able decline. The latter in particular is a wide-rang-ing and diverse group of loosely-related services,;each of which needs separate assessment.t Excluding investment grants;. and on certain importantassumptions or conventions, set out in paragraph 15 for defence, food subsidies, and current account grants to nationalised industries.

Part 2 of the Report sets out what could beachieved for the resources which were assumed tobe available for each programme for the purposesof this . exercise. Unless Ministers have first de-cided that, consistently with the general strategy forthe economy, a larger share of the prospective in-crease in our national resources can be made avail-able to the public sector than the figures in thisReport imply, any increase in one programme will need to be matched by offsetting reductions in another.15. The following points on selected programmes should be noted:(a) Defence: The figures for all years after1974-75 are notional, pending the outcome of the defence review.(b) Food Subsidies: For the purposes of the survey it is assumed that food subsidies willcontinue in 1975-76 at  450 million a year in real terms, but will thereafter decline to 300 million by 1978-79.(c) Nationalised Industries: In accordance withthe Cabinet decision, the investment figures have not been calculated by the arithmeticalformula used for most other public expendi-ture on goods and services. They reflect abest assessment by officials of the results of applying the considerations set out in para-graph 4(ii) above-although of course it remains for Ministers to take the basic deci-sion on priorities. Grants to the industries on current account including the cost of. price restraint-are put at nearly  900million in 1974-75; and provision of over 500 million is made in 1975-76. Provisionfor later-years is made only in respect ofBritish Railways and the coal industry.SECRET
(d) Housing: The Cabinet ruling did not sub-ject this programme to the strict limitationimposed on most other programmes. Thehousing figures in this Report, exceptionally,go beyond &quot; existing policy &quot; and include theview of the Housing Departments (to whichthe Treasury is not committed) on the costof a continuation into subsequent years, andin some fields the development, of the poli-cies adopted for 1974-75 at the time of theBudget. This adds between  185 million and  365 million to the totals for each year*.(e) Social Security: The figures take full ac-count of the 1974 upratings, due to take effect in July. For later years upratings areassumed, roughly annually, to increase longterm benefits in line with real earnings, and short term benefits in line with prices plus1  per cent. No provision is made in theprogramme figures for repetition of the lump sum payments to pensioners of  10 made in1972 and 1973. Nor is any provision madehere or in the Contingency Reserve for any major expansion of social security schemes.(/) Offshore oil infrastructure: Ministers agreed in April that expenditure on infrastructurefor offshore oil should be given speciallyfavourable, treatment: Such expenditure is classified under a number of different main programmes and will continue to be con-trolled as part of those programmes. for convenience, however, it has all been brought together as a special item in Part 2 (seeSpecial Analysis 7). In total it is expectedto amount to  52 million in 1975-76, rising to  64 million in 1976-77, and falling to 47 million in 1978-79. (No provision is included on account of the creation of aNational Oil Corporation, the effect of whichwould be to transfer from the private tothe public sector the use of an unchangedquantum of resources.)       .VCONTINGENCY RESERVE AND SHORTFALL16. Provision has been made in the totals for a contingency Reserve as follows:1974-75     1975-76     1976-77     1977-78     1978-79100 300 500 750 1,000The purpose of the Contingency Reserve is to cover any new policies or policy developments which ministers may decide upon during the period. Theproposed figures are larger than any previously used*In the view of the Treasury, not shared by the HousingDepartments, the housing totals overstate the further growth of the programme see paragraph 17 below on. shortfall.because there are on this occasion more and largeruncertainties than hitherto hanging over some major policy areas, viz:(i) food subsidies, where the declining provision\ made for the years after 1975-76 lacks any firm policy foundation;(ii) deficit grants-including those on account of price restraint to nationalised industries,where only limited provision is made for1975-76 and later years, thus anticipatingdecisions on nationalised industry prices which will only fall to be taken at later stages;(iii) assistance to industry, where no provision ismade for new policy initiatives;(iv) land policy, the expenditure effects of whichhave yet to be worked out;(v) social security, the programme figures forwhich allow nothing for new policy develop-ments.Even so, the Contingency Reserve how proposed would be unlikely to be able to accommodate /allthe additional expenditure for which pressuresmight develop in these-and all other-pro-grammes. On the contrary the implication of aReserve even on this scale is that future develop-ments of policy would be tightly constrained.17. Shortfall is meant to allow very broadly forthe extent to which existing programmes (notablyon construction and transfers) will be underspent.The allowance included is as follows:1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79-400	-300	-300	-300	-300These figures subsume some allowance for theTreasury&apos;s view-not shared by the HousingDepartments that the Housing programme figuresoverstate the further growth of the programme.PUBLIC EXPENDITURE, 1975-7618. Although the main decisions called for relateto the whole span of years running up to 1978-79,Ministers will wish to give special consideration inthe light of the current position and prospects to1975-76.19. As is explained more fully in Annex C it is forecast that there will be a significant fall in 1975in the demand on the construction industries inrelation to the industries&apos; total capacity. This isa relevant point in fixing levels of capital expendi-ture in 1975-76; but it should not be assumed to be decisive on its own, since other consequences would follow an increase in public sector capital spending,either elsewhere in public expenditure or in otherparts of the economy.
20. Local authority current expenditure, thelargest element in which is Education, is prone to exceed estimates substantially, and is not, under present arrangements, controlled by the centralGovernment. The level of local authority current expenditure in 1975-76 will be influenced by theRate Support Grant negotiations, which come toa head this autumn. Ministers will wish to con-sider how best to influence the growth of localauthority current expenditure in the light of the wider economic and financial; prospects.PUBLIC EXPENDITURE &quot; RELATIVE PRICE:   EFFECT &quot; I21. The figures in Tables 1-3, and in all theindividual programme Tables in Part 2, are given inconstant (1974 Survey) prices that is to say, in volume terms. They provide a measure of changesover time in the scale of provision of services underthe various programmes.22. However, figures in volume terms, since they take no account of future price changes, do not reflect the cost involved. For total public expendi-ture this is because on average the prices which are important for public expenditure rise faster thanprices in general; and for individual programmefigures it is because the prices relevant to differentprogrammes move differentially. It is possible-but in a very broad way only to adjust the figures to take account of this &quot; relative price effect&quot;.When the totals given in Table 3 are adjusted inthis way, they become:1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79. 38,727	40,105	40,611	41,697	42,992The average annual rate of growth over the periodon this basis would be 2 - 7 per cent. This wouldcompare with 2-0 per cent for the period 1973-74to: 1977-78 shown in the last Governments white paper of last December.  .CONCLUSION23. The information set out in this Report is relevant to the decisions which Ministers will need to take on the following questions:(i) Whether the broad rate of growth of 2- per cent in volume terms (2f per cent in demand terms) in public expenditure between1974-75 and 1978-79 shown in this Reportcan be accommodated in the Governmentseconomic strategy, bearing in mind the implications for the growth of privately-financed consumption?(ii) Subject to (i), what adjustments, up and down,are desirable in the medium term to theindividual programmes and policies?(iii) Having regard to the short-term economic factors, are the figures for 1975-76 accept-able?SECRET151327b* 27
Annex ABasis adopted in arriving at the expenditure figures entered in the1974 Survey for 1975-76 and later yearsGoods and services. The broad aim is to ensure that the totalityof expenditure on goods and services (i.e. all capital and current expenditure other than transfers) shallrun as follows:(i) for 1975-76: no change from 1974-75, save in so far as expenditure on wages and salaries was expected to increase;(ii) for 1976-77 to 1978-79: an average annual increase of about 2 per cent, being approxi-mately the increase envisaged in the 1974Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd.5519).But within this overall aim, the figures for main programmes would continue to display the samerelative rates of changes as were implied in Cmnd.5519. This broad aim would be achieved by adop-tion of the following arrangements.2. 1975-76: take the main programme figures in cmnd. 55190) and calculate 12  per cent of thecurrent expenditure on goods and services otherthan wages and salaries (following the definitionsused for the cuts of 17 December 1973), and 25per cent of the capital expenditure (gross domesticfixed capital formation). The sum of these two isthe amount by which the Cmnd. 5519 figures haveto be reduced; but the Department may make thereduction as it sees fit over the whole of its expendi-ture on goods and services, capital^) and current,including wages and salaries, in respect of eachmain programme. Where a Department hasexpenditure in these categories in more than oneprogramme, the Department may aggregate andredistribute the total. (In the case of some pro-grammes the figures for &quot; other current expenditureon goods and services &quot; resulting from the use ofthe National Income accounts classification includeelements in respect of wages and salaries, and of rents and rates.   These elements should be sub-C1) Revalued to 1974 Survey prices and including here and inall other references in this Annex any agreed policy or estimatingchanges as accepted for the 1 March Running Tally.(2) Denned as gdfcf, i.e. not including stocks.tracted before applying the reductions described above.(3))3. 1976-77: calculate the rate of growth forthe total of all current and capital expenditure on goods and services (including wages and salaries)implied in Cmnd. 5519 between 1975-76 and1976-77. Apply that rate of growth to the cor-responding figure for 1975-76 arrived at under paragraph 2 above. The resultant figure provides the ceiling for expenditure in 1976-77 on goods and services. Within that ceiling the Department maysuggest whatever disposition of those resources willbest serve its policy ends.4. 1977-78: as for 1976-77, mutatis mutandis,the base being of course moved forward one year.5. 1978-79: calculate the average annual rateof increase implied in Cmnd. 5519 for the years1975-76 to 1977-78 in respect of the total of allcurrent and capital expenditure on goods and services. Apply this average annual rate to the1977-78 figure resulting from paragraph 4 above.This provides a ceiling for expenditure on goods and services as in the two preceding years.6. Exemptions : Four programmes Defence,Nationalised Industry capital expenditure, housing and Northern Ireland will be exempt from thisarrangement, as will expenditure on infrastructurein any other programme which is a direct conse-quence of the development of off-shore oil.Transfers7. There is to be no presumption that transfersare exempt from the spirit of the approach to directexpenditure on goods and services, and the aimwill be to apply comparable stringency to themwherever practicable. Where transfers to organisa-tions lead to expenditure on goods and services, thenormal rule should be that they be treated as partof the Department^ aggregate purchases of goods and services for the purposes of paragraph 2 above.Scope for reductions of transfers in support ofindustrial investment will, however, require separate consideration with the Treasury.(3) But note that the 25 per cent calculation applies to elements of capital classified in &quot; other current expenditure on goods and services &quot;.
Annex B1974 Survey Report: Relationship with Cmnd. 55191. Table 4 below shows changes in public expendi-ture figures from the late Governments last public expenditure White Paper (Cmnd, 5519), through the1st March position inherited by the present admin-istration, to the figures in this Report. This is doneby programme, and for the years 1974-75 to1977-78, which are common to Cmnd. 5519 andthis Report.2. The figures start with Cmnd. 5519 which was published on 17th December 1973. But that white paper itself took account of nearly  600 million of reductions affecting 1974-75 which had been announced on 21st May 1973. The composition of those reductions was as follows: million at 1974 Survey prices1974-75 m.Defence   .Agriculture, fisheries and forestryTrade, industry and employmentNationalised industriesRoads 1 .      .      .Other environmental services law, order and protective services education and libraries, science and Arts Health and personal social services social security .      .      .      .Other public services .      .Common services total   .-68-28-33-148-99-141-14-31-15-4-4-9-5943. On the day Cmnd. 5519 was published, Mr.Barber made a Statement on the economic situation,and announced cuts in the Cmnd. 5519 programmesamounting (at 1974 Survey prices) to  1,365 million for the financial year 1974-75. The implications of these cuts for subsequent years were to be worked out later; but this was not done before thelast Administration left office.4. Between 17th December and the General Elec-tion there were estimating changes (changes inestimates of cost not related to any changes ofpolicy) to certain programmes; and there werepolicy changes made by the previous Administra-tion.5. Provision in respect of 1974-75 was made inthe Chancellor^ Budget Statement for policy changes decided upon by the present Administra-tion. The Chancellor said in his Budget statement that he would not be going back on the cutsannounced by his predecessor on 17th December:thus an agreed position was established by presentMinisters for 1974-75, but not for later years.6. Ministers decided that the starting point for thepresent Survey should be the position as at 1stMarch 1974, and that the formula described inin Annex A should be applied to the figures as recorded up to that date. The line &quot; other changes&quot; in the following table subsumes theresults of applying the rules for the conduct of thisyear&apos;s Survey to the 1st March figures.Public expenditure by programme:  relationship with Cmnd. 5519TABLE 4   million at 1974 Survey prices1974-75      1975-76      1976-77      1977-78Defence Budget -Cmnd. 5519       .      .      .      ...      .      ,      -      -      - 3,873 3^929          3^936          3^983December 17 cuts    .........      . .      -      -      -      - -207Estimating changes.......... +1I Previous Governments policy changes...... &quot;March 1 position .                               ...... 3,667 3,929         3^36         3^983Present Governments policy changes .      .      . .      -      - -55Other changes...........- &quot;** &apos;^3711974 Survey .      .      ...      .      .      ,      .      . 3,612 3,612 3,612 3,612

Annex CThe Construction IndustryConstruction is a large and important industry morethan usually dependent on public sector demand:nearly one half of its output is for the public sectorclients, Although it is normally subject to cyclicalfluctuations in demand, and to a lesser extent in output, the upturn in demand in 1971-1973 led toan abnormal level of work outstanding in 1973.Both, the very steep rise in prices during 1973 andthe unusually large, prospective fall in demand and output during 1974 have given rise to concern.Recent conditions2. The overheating which had developed by 1973was mainly confined to the private housing and building contracting sectors of the industry: civil engineering was much less severely affected. Ten-der prices for building work rose to very high levels-during 1973 Q3 prices were about 80 per cent higher than two years earlier and consequently thecontrol of public expenditure by cost limits broke down. This steep rise in prices for building work,which did not occur in earlier boom periods, wasassociated with the inability of contractors to expandoutput as fast as demand; a critical shortage wasskilled labour.  ;\ 3. The high tender prices are expected to lead toabnormally high profits as the contracts are being completed, even after allowing for inflation in labour, material and other costs. Thus, tenderprices in 1973 Q3 seem likely to exceed costs, in-cluding a normal margin for profits, finance charges and other overheads, by about 10-15 per cent for local authority housing and by about 20-25 percent for other public building work. After makingbroad estimates of the above-normal finance charges and other overheads, these tender prices imply ex-cess profits which, if earned on all public building work over a full year, would amount to  200-350million. The profits of individual firms in the in-dustry are likely to vary enormously.4. To relieve the pressure on tender prices theGovernment arranged a three month moratoriumof new starts on public construction (non-housing)works from October 1973. After the end of thismoratorium the level of new orders for public sectorconstruction work was substantially below its pre-moratorium level because of the public expenditure cuts announced in December 1973.5. Other indicators of pressure on the industryapart from prices and costs, such as unemployment,unfilled vacancies and the ratio of work outstandingto capacity, tell a similar story of a very sharp risein pressure in late 1972 into early 1973, but in thelatter part of 1973 pressure began to ease, led bythe decline in private house building. The declinein new orders suggests that the pressure would fallsharply once the backlog of work was out of theway by about middle 1974. The drop of about  per cent in the seasonally adjusted figure of opera-tives employed between the end of 1973 and earlyApril 1974 confirms this easing of pressure.Prospects for the construction industry(a) Output6. Table 5 includes the latest forecasts of output for the construction industry, both by type of pur-chases and by the two main sectors, building and civil engineering, between which management, plant and even, some classes of skilled labour cannot be freely switched from year to year.7. The peak in output and the expected depth ofthe trough would be obscured by taking the financialyear 1973-74 as a base mainly owing to the very low output in the 1974 Ql caused by the energycrisis. The table therefore includes the figures forthe calendar year 1973, together with the percentagechanges between 1973 and the financial years 1974-75 to 1976-77.8.&apos; Construction output is forecast to be below the1973 level by 5 per cent in 1974-75, 6 per cent in1975-76 and 3 per cent in 1976-77. The declineis expected to be sharpest in the private housing and the public non-housing sectors, with somecounterbalance through continued demand for pri-vate industrial and commercial work and by asubstantial rise in public housing activity. civil engineering work, which comprises over one halfof non-housing public sector output, is expected to decline rather less than building work mainly be-cause of work from the Public Corporations; output for the roads, water and sewerage sectors is likelyto be significantly reduced.(b) Capacity of the industry. Present or future capacity cannot be determined in a simple manner either for the industry as awhole or individual sectors. Labour and other fac-tors of production can, to some extent, be switchedbetween industries, and so the capacity of an individual industry depends upon its share of these factors within the economy as a whole; a share thatin turn depends in part on the demand for that industry&apos;s products.  As with most other industries,
estimates of future construction capacity are madeby projecting the achieved peaks in output after allowing for the likely supply of labour (and other factors of production) and for the likely trend of productivity in terms of output per man.10. Output per man varies from year to year butit rose at a trend rate of about 3J per cent per year over the period 1964 to 1972: ignoring cyclicalfluctuations the upward trend in output was about per cent per year and manpower fell. Output perman tends to rise somewhat more rapidly during periods of increasing output, but exceptionally in1973 output per man actually fell and remained lowin Ql 1974 during the fuel crisis period. There is thus greater uncertainty than usual in projecting thetrends in output per man.11. The limiting factors on construction output in1973 were skilled labour, particularly bricklayersand carpenters, and materials rather than plant. Itis clear that the pressure of demand in 1973 wasexcessive and thus the level of demand in relationto output achieved in 1973 should not be regardedas sustainable from the point of view of public policy.12. The reduction in pressure of demand in 1974and 1975 is expected to lead to sharp falls in output,and even without increases in output per man, to lead to a decline in the demand for labour, perhapsamounting to about 50,000 jobs for skilled workersalone. A sharp and prolonged downturn in con-struction activity could well diminish future capacityof the industry because of a reduction in the num-bers of apprentices and a permanent outflow oflabour from the industry, and through a reductionin the capacity of the building materials industry.Such falls in capacity would create problems duringthe next period of high demand.(c) Prices and costs13. The abnormal profit element in prices for1974 Ql remains very high; the gap betweentender prices and the costs which contractors mightbe expected to incur has not yet narrowed. Theeffect on prices and profits of an upswing in demand during and after 1975 depends upon circum-stances. On the one hand there is the danger thatthe period of abnormal profits expected in 1974-75would be prolonged and that over-generous longterm wage agreements would be concluded. Con-struction workers are currently renegotiating their national minimum rates, but the rise in labour costs would depend also on negotiations at sitelevel which will take place in 1975-76 as well asin 1974-75. The bargaining strength of the unionsis likely to depend on profit levels which would bevery high.14. On the other hand, if the upswing in demand is delayed or too low, higher overheads on thelower output and the higher earnings needed to attract men back to the industry could lead to higher prices than would be the case. increases in prices due to these cost factors would be smallcompared with an increase in prices caused by are currence of the profits inherent in tenders in late1973 (probably 5 per cent compared with up to25 per cent). But it is possible the exceptionalprofits on building non-housing tenders let in 1973which did not occur in previous periods of excessdemand reflected not only supply difficulties but alsothe earlier unprecedented rise in the prices for private houses. The profits earned on speculativehouse building may have influenced contractors&apos;pricing policies for building contracting work.Thus, whilst excess demand will probably alwayslead to improved profits it does not necessarily follow that profits will always spiral to the unprecedent-dented levels contained in tenders let late in 1973.Summary of prospects15. Our ability to forecast the future is limited and uncertain, and it would be hazardous toindulge in &quot; fine tuning &quot; of demand on the industry,although it is important to avoid both large excessesand deficiencies in demand.16. Demand and output are expected to be wellbelow capacity during the second half of 1974and throughout 1975 leaving a large margin ofunused resources. We should expect some shortterm benefit on costs and prices from the elimination -tion of excess demand, particularly in the labour market. However, a prolonged period of demanddeficiency would not only lead to a loss of output and jobs but might, through reducing the capacityof the industry and the pool of available skilled labour, lead to a re-emergence of excess profits and excessive labour costs when demand recovers,and to the possibility of coming up against capacityconstraints in 1976.17. The special rules agreed for this year&apos;s Surveywere not drawn up with a view to taking intoaccount the short-term problems of the construction industry. But the effects both the exemption of housing expenditure from cuts and the concentration of other cuts on capital programmes are likely tobe particularly significant for the construction in-dustry. Ministers will wish to take the prospects for the industry into account in reaching decisions on programmes, especially in relation to next year.18. The Department of the Environment considersthat the prospects for output and employment are so serious as to justify early action to improve them.In the opinion of the Department this requires someselective action to allow higher levels of expenditureon programmes of importance for the industry thanthose provided for in this Survey, in respect ofboth 1975-76 and 1976-77.
19. But the Treasury consider that a decision toincrease public sector construction programmes should only be taken in the light of other competing claims on the economy and of public expendituredecisions as a whole. Ministers will not wish to take decisions on the basis of an appraisal of oneindustry alone. Furthermore, they will wish tosatisfy themselves that an addition to constructionprogrammes would not create a further surge of excess profits; and they will want to bear in mind that the additional projects will not be those towhich Departments would give the highest priority.TABLE 5Construction Output and ForecastsGreat Britain,   million at constant 1970 prices	1970	1971	1972	1973	1974	1975	1976	Change on 1973 Calendar Year										1974-75  1975-76  1976-77 (financial years)		New work Public housing Private housing      .	682 733	633 842	582 977	569 1,039	615 790	650 860	695 965	% + 12 -24	% + 16 -15	% -4Total      .     &apos;,.	1,415	1,475	1,559	1,608	1,405	1,510	1,660	-12	-4	+public non-housing: Building.....

This expenditure includes the cost of theForeign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) inLondon, British diplomatic and consular representa-tion in more than 120 countries and 8 officialdelegations to international organisations and con-ferences. It covers the cost of staff (excluding those engaged on information work) as well as their officeand residential accommodation abroad, and officialtravel. Also included in the expenditure figures isthe cost of the Passport Offices in London and other centres and the communications organisation insupport of the Diplomatic Service.2. Overseas Representation is labour-intensive and much of the expenditure is staff related. However,the Diplomatic Service has been reduced in size byabout 13 per cent since 1965 despite increasingcommitments. An additional cut of  400,000 ayear in staff costs was imposed last November forthe years 1975-76 to 1977-78. This has had tobe implemented at the expense of the manpowermargin which the Plowden Report confirmed asvital in an overseas service (Cmnd. 2276, para-graphs 86-90). Manpower totals have now beenstabilised at this lower level for the whole of the survey period.3. The costs of supporting services, e.g. com-munications and accommodation, are also includedin this programme. The existing global com-munications system provides an essential service,both for the FCO and for other GovernmentDepartments, which must be maintained. The pro-vision for future years assumes the continuance ofthe capital programme at a lower level, which would necessitate deferring or abandoning, at the costof some efficiency, certain capital projects designedto improve and modernise existing facilities. the overseas accommodation programme must continueto provide for British representation in more than120 countries, but the reduced capital provision will mean that the 10-year purchasing and building programme announced to Parliament in 1971 wouldnot be completed as planned. The reducedprovision for purchasing would have to be largelyreserved for contingencies such as the unavoidablereplacement of office premises. The consequentshelving of plans for replacing rented staff accom-modation with owned property would prolong thepayment of constantly rising rents. The reducedallocation would mean that some projects will haveto be deferred and others cancelled. The cumulative effect of these reductions over the Survey period willbe severe.
Overseas information4. This covers three main elements:(a) British Council expenditure to promotewider knowledge of the United Kingdomand the English language abroad and to foster cultural relations with other countries.(The remainder of the Council&apos;s expenditure is included in Overseas Aid.)ib) The cost of the BBCs External Services andassociated expenditure involved in british broadcasting directed to other countries.(c) The cost of information staff at home andabroad and their operational expenses, andof supporting services of the Central Officeof Information and the Stationery Office.5. The expenditure in the table would involve asubstantial reduction below the 1973-74 level of activity. This is already resulting in cuts in BBCregional services and other economies, the reduc-tion or closure of some British Council posts and reduced Central Office of Information (COI) andFCO overseas information activities. The level ofexpenditure would also require a further decline inactivity during the Survey period, accelerating in1978-79, which would necessitate the abolition of minor BBC vernacular services, the reduction or clo-sure of further British Council posts, cutbacks inthe COL on such services as tours and exhibitionsand more economies in the FCO information ser-vices. These would result in staff reductions andassociated problems.6. The capital programme would provide for theconstruction of a  5 million replacement for the far east relay station in Tebrau, which the BBC havebeen given notice to quit, and a new Caribbean relaystation jointly with their German counterpart. Itwould also provide for the first stage of an improve-ment scheme for the Cyprus relay station, and part ofthe cost of modernising Bush House. In order to contain it within the proposed level of expendi-ture, the programme would have to be spread overa longer period than was originally envisaged. the delays would have a cumulative effect on trans-mission as old equipment was stretched beyondits useful life, and engineering difficulties would beincreased. In the case of the British CounciPsbuilding programme the delays would result in anincreased rent bill.Other external relations7. This item consists mainly of expenditure onthe Secret Service, certain Overseas Service pensionsand international commitments and subscriptions,including the United Kingdom&apos;s assessed contribu-tions to regular budgets of United Nationsorganisations and of the Organisation for economic co-operation and Development, the Council ofEurope and the North Atlantic Treaty OrganisationCONFIDENTIAL(Secretariat costs), and a grant in aid to theCommonwealth War Graves Commission. Theprogramme also covers Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentscontribution to the support of the United nations force in Cyprus, which has recently been reduced,and to the United Nations Emergency Force in theMiddle East. No provision has been made for a contribution to the expenses of the EmergencyForce after 1974-75,Military aid8. This heading covers military training assistance which provides for courses in the United kingdom for the service personnel of other countries, theprovision of British service personnel on loan to developing (mainly Commonwealth) countries, anda small amount of police training, particularly inSouth-East Asia. The forecast for 1974-75 also includes final instalments of capital aid to Kenya,Malawi and Malaysia.9. The level of expenditure in the table assumesthe withdrawal of the Military Advisory Team inthe United Arab Emirates before the end of1974-75, and a significant reduction in militarytraining assistance from 1975-76 onwards.Overseas aid10. The total shown for the aid programme in1975-76 is  9-2 million (2-8 per cent) below theprovision for 1974-75. The average rate of increasein the years after 1975-76 is 6 - 5 per cent. this compares with an average annual rate of 6-3 percent indicated in the last statement of officialUnited Kingdom policy for the period 1973-74 to1977-78.11. The previous Administration undertook thatthe United Kingdom would do its best to reach the 1 per cent of GNP target for total flows tothe developing countries by 1975. Performancehas deteriorated over recent years and present indications are that the United Kingdom will againfall short of this target in 1974. The new situation created by the rise in oil prices is bound to affectboth the performance of the United Kingdom andof other principal donors on the 1 per cent targetand the date by which it might be achieved.12. In The Queen&apos;s Speech of March 1974 and invarious international fora (including the united nations and the European Economic Community)the Government has said it will seek to increasethe provision of aid. While this implies at least a rising trend over a period of years, this doesnot in the Treasury view exclude annual fluctua-tions in the light of the overall public expenditure and economic situation, or a check in our upwardprogress in a particular year. The present Govern-ment have accepted in principle the 0 - 7 per centtarget for official development assistance, but ithas been made clear that we cannot give any
undertakings about, the date of reaching it; and thatwhile we shall seek in the years ahead to move towards it, this must be subject both to the pace of our economic recovery and to the other callson our resources. Accordingly it has been acceptedinterdepartmentally that acceptance of the target isnot relevant to discussion in the Public expenditure survey of the size of the aid programme.13. The Ministry of Overseas Development doesnot claim that the reduction of  9-2 million inthe aid programme in 1975-76, as compared with1974-75, would create an impossible situation inthe sense that any of their existing specific com-commitments to the developing countries would haveto be cut back. But the United Kingdom hassupported proposals in the e.c. and elsewhere toassist developing countries hardest hit by higheroil prices and moves to replenish the funds availableto the International Development Association. Ifthese plans matured, and if the e.c. negotiationswith associable countries under Protocol XXII ledto the creation of a large European development fund, a number of new commitments in the1975-76 and subsequent years could not be avoidedwithout breach of international good faith. Thescale of these commitments, and the years ofdisbursement, cannot be accurately forecast atpresent but in the view of the Ministry of overseas development it could prove very difficult to absorbthem within aid programme figures on the scaleindicated above.Contributions to the European Communities, etc.(net)14. This comprises United Kingdom contributions to the European Communities&apos; budget (excludingamounts attributed to the United Kingdom aid programme); capital contributions to the EuropeanInvestment Bank and the European Coal and steel community; and estimated receipts from the Com-munities&apos; budget. (Receipts by the private sectorare not included.)15. The forecasts have been built up by applying the forecast United Kingdom share of the Com-munities&apos; budget in each year to estimates of the costs of different items of Community expenditure.The forecasts for receipts reflect best estimates ofour share of receipts. The forecasts make no allowance for, possible new policies (e.g. on the regional Development Fund) or for developmentson existing policies (e.g. on the European Agricul-tural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF))and in this and certain other respects they differ from the forecasts prepared for the RenegotiationExercise. The conversion of contributions fromunits of account to pounds sterling has been made,in accordance with the eec&apos;s budgetary regulations,at the rate of 2-4 units of account to the  , morefavourable to the United Kingdom than a rate ofabout 2-0 units of account to the   which wouldreflect current exchange rate relationships.16. The Survey figures are somewhat below thosein Cmnd. 5519 revalued. This reflects a numberof changes, but mainly a reduction in the forecastexpenditure for the EAGGF (Guarantee) Section,The forecast fall in net contributions between1973-74 and 1974-75 results from the timing ofcertain of our payments in 1973-74 and receipts in1974-75. It also reflects an estimate of the refunddue, as a result of end year accounting adjustments,in 1974-75 in respect of payments made in 1973-74.Sterling area guarantees17. The guarantee given to certain official sterlingholders in September 1973 had to be implementedas a result of the depreciation of sterling againstthe United States dollar in the period up to end-March 1974.

The table follows that adopted in Cmnd. 5519and currently includes . identifiable expenditure inNorthern Ireland by the Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food on schemes of assistance to agriculture and fisheries which are common through-out the United Kingdom.Market and production support-general. It was not thought appropriate at this stage tomake any significant cuts on transfer payments foragricultural support. This expenditure represents an investment in domestic food supply the levelof) which has a direct relationship with consumerprices and balance of payments costs. With severalsectors coming under severe pressure recently,expenditure has tended to increase, and this affectsparticularly the figures for the&quot; early years of the survey.   Furthermore any review of the general level of agricultural support should properly takeplace in the context of the Annual Review ofAgriculture.market operations under cap3. Expenditure under this heading relates to thepayments made by the Intervention Board forAgricultural Produce in implementing the CAPsystem of agricultural support. There are two main elements in these forecasts: the net cost of com-modities bought into intervention and subsequentlysold, and the gross cost of certain other supportmeasures, which are pre-funded by advances fromthe European Agricultural Guidance and guarantee fund (EAGGF). Losses on sales from interven-tion stocks are also reimbursed from EAGGF andthese receipts are shown under Programme 2. the forecast for 1974-75 allows for a build-up of certainintervention stocks. Apart from this, the risingtrend of expenditure over later years reflects thefact that, as the United Kingdom adjusts to Com-munity  support  levels  through the transitionalCONFIDENTIAL15oW
period, the level of export refunds and of certainproduction subsidies and the net cost of interven-tion met by Community funds will increase.price guarantees4. The Treaty of Accession provides for theUnited Kingdom market prices for products towhich the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)applies to be raised to e.c. levels by six stepsbetween 1973 and 1978 and for the deficiency round for these products to be ended duringthis period. The guarantees on beef, rye, eggs and sugar beet have already been discontinued, andthe cost of implementing the milk guarantee in1974-75 will be financed under the arrangementsfor food subsidies. For the remaining CAPproducts (cereals and pigmeat) market prices are currently well above the guaranteed levels and the1974-75 estimate allows only for residual payments in respect of previous years a saving of about  54million compared with Cmnd. 5519 revalued. Itis extremely difficult however to predict the futurelevel of world market prices and for later years the forecasts in Cmnd. 5519 revalued have been repeated these forecasts assumed a return to more normal price levels, with the level of deficiency round reducing as the CAP support system takesover under the transitional arrangements. Theprovision for 1975-76 should be reviewed in theearly Autumn. If present forecasts of market pricesprove correct it is unlikely that deficiency payments will arise in that year.5. For other products a continuation of deficiency round for sheepmeat and of support forpotatoes, has been assumed in 1975-76 and subse-quent years. The figures for 1974-75 and 1975-76take account of high market prices and allow forthe recovery of past deficiency payments on wool.production grant and subsidies6. This item consists mainly of the continuation of the calf and beef cow subsidies and of twoEEC schemes the Dairy Herd Conversion Schemeand the guidance -premiums for farmers whosedevelopment plans under the Farm and horticulture-ture Development Scheme provide for the farmbusiness to concentrate on beef and sheepmeatproduction. The 1974-75 figures include residualpayments of lime and fertiliser subsidies. Expendi-ture is also included in 1974-75 ( 50 million) and1975-76 ( 18 million) arising from recent Govern-ment decisions in respect of the special subsidy for pigs, increased rates of calf subsidy and the subsidy on oil used in horticulture.7. It was assumed in Cmnd. 5519 that the transi-tion to the CAP would result in savings in the levelof existing production grants and subsidies of  10million in 1975-76 and  20 million in each subsequent year. These assumed savings have been continued in the present Survey.Support for capital and other improvements8. Changes in the rates and conditions of the FarmCapital Grant Scheme in recent years, and farmers&apos;reactions to the changes, make it difficult to fore-cast the level of grant expenditure. The submission of claims for grant on completed work has so far been slower than was expected from the volumeof projects already approved. The forecasts have therefore been adjusted to take account of this.The forecasts also include farm structure grants,the Horticulture Capital Grant Scheme and the farm and Horticulture Development Scheme ofthe e.c..Support for agriculture in special areas9. The figures for support in special areas make provision for a continuation of the hill sheep andhill cattle subsidies and winter keep supplements.Cmnd. 5519 took into account the prospectiveintroduction of the e.c. Directive on less-favouredareas and the current forecasts for 1975-76 to1978-79 have been reduced by  1 million a year on this account.Other assistance to agricultural production, foodprocessing and marketing10. The main elements under this heading areadvisory services, agricultural training and research,the eradication and control of animal diseases, pay-ments in respect of Commonwealth sugar and the improvements of wholesale horticultural markets bylocal authorities.11. Under the formula the revised ceiling for goods and services from 1975-76 can largely be met by reducing payments to Research Councils for corn-missioned research by about  2 million a year andby abandoning proposals for the improvement ofthe Spitalfields wholesale horticultural market ( 1-1 million in 1975-76 and  0-3 million in 1976-77).The extent to which the resources available tothe Research Councils are in fact reduced dependsalso on the extent to which the Science Budget itself is reduced and on how the total is allocated betweenthe various Research Councils, and not simply onthe reduction in payments for commissioned work by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.In Scotland the reductions will amount to about  1 million annually and can be met from agricultural research and education programmes. Scottishresearch programmes are not included in the science budget and separate action will be required bythe Department of Agriculture and Fisheries forScotland. The Spitalfields project has already been delayed for planning reasons and for grant purposesthere is a statutory deadline for the completion ofwork in April 1976.12. Transfer payments under this heading relatemainly to brucellosis eradication and the grant in aid to the Agricultural Training Board. Gallonage
premiums for milk from brucellosis-free herdswhich had previously been recouped from the revenues from the sales of liquid milk are nowcharged to this programme following the introduc-tion of the consumer subsidy. No other changesin present policies are proposed. The figure for1974-75 also contains  47 million in respect of commonwealth sugar arrangements, including thedecision to make supplementary payments underthe Commonwealth Sugar Agreement.Food subsidies13. In his Budget Statement of 26th March theChancellor foresaw expenditure on food subsidiesin 1974-75 of about  550 million. So far only about  390 million has been committed and it now seems unlikely that expenditure in the current year will exceed  500 million. The Prices Bill providesfor expenditure on food subsidies of up to  700million, so giving statutory cover for some con-tinuing expenditure in 1975-76 (other than on milk and butter subsidies which are covered until 31stMarch 19751 only). No decisions, however, have yet been taken on the overall level of expenditureon food subsidies in 1975-76 and thereafter. Forthe purpose of this Survey it has been assumed thatfor counter-inflationary reasons it will be necessaryto maintain food subsidies at about their present level in, 1975-76 but thereafter they will be rundown gradually over the remainder of the survey period. This assumption is, however, arbitrary.Actual expenditure will depend on policy decisionsyet to be taken.14. Expenditure in 1974-75 includes the subsidy for milk of  260 million, which takes the form ofa payment to MAFF to. reimburse them for theirpayments to the Milk Marketing Boards under the milk guarantee arrangements: the cheese and breadsubsidies of  30 million and  47 million respec-tively: and the butter subsidy of  53 million ofwhich  10 million is contributed from the Com-munity Budget (EAGGF). Further expenditure will depend on what additional foods are subsidised,and on the extent to which any of the existingsubsidies may need to be increased. The provisionof  450 million includes an allowance for these factors, but it must inevitably be subject to a con-siderable margin of error and could prove to be too low.Covent Garden Market Authority15. The figures relate to capital expenditure on thefinal stages of construction of the new covent garden Market at Nine Elms and estimated receipts from the sale of land at the present market.Central and miscellaneous services16.  Central services comprise the main expenditure by the Agricultural Departments on staff costs andCONFIDENTIALadministration of the agricultural and food pro-grammes. Various economies in administration are proposed in order to keep within the formulaallocation and it is not expected that these will seriously disrupt the carrying out of existing policies in 1975-76 and subsequently. The figures for1974V75 do not at present include any additional provision for the administration of food subsidies.17. Miscellaneous services include the staff costs and maintenance of the Royal Botanic Gardens atKew, Wakehurst Place and Edinburgh, expenditureon land management and smallholdings, and publicity.Support for the fishing industry18. The main expenditure on goods and services in this programme is on fisheries research and, inScotland, fishery protection and assistance for theimprovement of fishery harbours, and some reduc-tions are proposed for keeping within the resources available. In Scotland the reductions imposed bythe formula for revised ceilings 11 on assistance forfishery harbours will aggravate the present situationin which the larger size of vessels now beingdelivered is making the existing facilities inadequateat a number of ports.19. Transfer payments relate chiefly to grants and loans for new vessels and equipment. The figures at present assume the continuation of current levels of assistance but the grant and loan arrangements are being reviewed.Manpower implications20. The reductions implied in the expenditureproposals for the agriculture and fisheries pro-gramme are not expected to lead to any significantmanpower reductions by the Agricultural Depart-ments. Major savings in this area are not feasiblewithout corresponding reductions in the scope ofthe schemes of assistance for the agricultural industry. The manpower proposals assume in factthat mainly due to better recruitment prospects, theAgricultural Departments will be able to increasestaff numbers towards the complement needed tocarry out their functions.Forestry21. This item covers the activities of the forestry commission in promoting the interests of forestry,the establishment and maintenance of adequate reserves of growing trees and the production and supply of timber. The Commission^ activities arein two parts; the State Forestry Enterprise, which isclassed as a Government Trading Service; and the forestry Authority. The Survey figures consist ofinterest on capital (increasing from  18-6 million to  20 - 8 million), depreciation and the grant-in-aid;the last decreases over the Survey period from 10-1 million to  9-3 million because of increasingtrading receipts.9
22. As the State Forestry Enterprise the Corn-mission is carrying out a combined planting andrestocking programme of up to 22,000 hectares ayear which will increase the size of its forestryestate from about 790,000 hectares to about 880,000hectares at the end of the quinquennium with aplantable reserve of about 80,000 hectares.Approximately 850 kilometres of new roads will be constructed. About 9-8 million cubic metres of timber will be harvested. Improvement of recreational-tional facilities comprise the construction of 4major and 21 minor information centres, 12 camp-ing sites and 96 picnic places and view points withassociated car parking facilities.23. As the Forestry Authority the Commissionundertakes research into all branches of forestry,controls felling in private woodlands and providesgrants and technical advice to private woodlandowners. The annual cost is about  4-7 million ayear.24. The staff required to carry out these policiesdecrease from about 8,500 man years to approxi-mately 7,900 over the quinquennium, primarily asa result of improved productivity.

The Trade, Industry and Employment pro-gramme contains major expenditure by five depart-ments-Industry, Energy, Trade, Prices and Con-sumer Protection and Employment, as well as small amounts by some Scottish and Welsh Departments.The table below shows the apportionment between these departments. A large percentage of this expenditure leads to industrial investment or toencouraging industry to innovate and to be more efficient. The cuts required on goods and services are all included and fall heavily on research estab-lishments and particularly on aircraft R&amp;D.

The forecasts assume that grants will continueto be made under Part 1 of the Industry Act 1972towards the cost of buildings and of plant and machinery in the assisted areas and that the ratesof grant and extent of the assisted areas will remain unchanged. It has also been assumed that there willbe no significant change in the sectors of industrycovered by the scheme. The forecasts reflect therate of uptake of grants so far, and are lower thanthose in Cmnd. 5519 revalued.Provision of land and buildings3. On present estimates the provision in Table 4 isexpected to be sufficient to maintain existing policies for factory building and land purchase.Selective assistance to industry in assisted areas4. Over the period 1974-75 to 1977-78 the fore-casts are about  25 million higher than those in cmnd. 5519 revalued. This is due to the inclusionof provision for assistance to shipbuilding modern-isation schemes. The forecasts for assistanceoutside the shipbuilding industry take account of aconsiderable shift from loans to interest relief grantscompared with Cmnd. 5519 revalued.Special assistance for rural and highland areas5. Provision is made for the Development Fund atCmnd. 5519 revalued levels and for the grant in aid to the Highlands and Islands development board at a level considerably below Cmnd. 5519revalued.CONFIDENTIALAssistance for publicity etc.6. The provision covers grants to be paid to development Councils in England, Wales and scotland.Regional employment premium7. Provision has been made for continuing to paythe premium at current levels to manufacturing esta-blishments in development areas beyond September1974 while considering&quot; further possibilities for thefuture. It has been assumed that Ministers would want to maintain its value in real terms over theperiod rather than to keep to constant cash pay-ments.Residual expenditure under repealed sections of theLocal Employment Act 19728. The forecasts assume that all payments inrespect of outstanding commitments under the re-pealed sections of the Act will be completed during1976-77. There are reductions compared withCmnd. 5519 revalued, due mainly to lower forecasts for building grants and grants under Section 4 ofthe Act.INDUSTRIAL INNOVATIONIndustrial Research Establishments and ComputerAided Design CentreIndustrial  research   and  development  contracts,grants and other support9. It is proposed that expenditure by the Depart-ment of Industry on these two subprogrammesshould be treated as a management budget. TheIndustrial Research Establishments undertake workfor Government Departments, for public authoritiesand for industry. Extra-mural support includes thatto Industrial Research Associations, terminal assist-ance to the hovercraft industry and work on marinetechnology and materials. To keep within the ceiling laid down for expenditure by the department on goods and services will involve reductions in expenditure on the Departments behalf at the atomic Energy Authority and Natural Environ-mental Research Council, and in support for the design Council.10. There is also expenditure under these pro-grammes outside the proposed management budget and controlled by the Department of Energy, mainly in support of the Departments responsibilities forsafety in offshore fields and on the development ofnew technologies for exploiting offshore oil and gasand getting them ashore. Provision is also madefor further geological studies of the Continental Shelfand for some general energy studies to be made bythe Energy Technology Support Unit at Harwell.13
Another part of the programme under the controlof the Department of Energy is for the continuation of the work of the Safety in Mines Research Estab-lishment at about its current level.National research and development corporation11. It is assumed that no interest relief grant willbe payable after 31st March 1974.Technological and industrial sponsorship12. The activities under this heading constitute a management budget. In order to keep within theamounts available for &quot; goods and services &quot; theCmnd. 5519 revalued forecasts have been reducedby  1-5 million in each of the years 1975-76 and1976-77 and by  0-5 million in 1977-78. At theselower levels there will be little scope for new projects to be started in the next year or two.Aircraft and  aero-engine  general research  anddevelopment programme13. This programme is under review. Cmnd. 5519revalued included provision of about  20 million ayear but these estimates have been reduced by 6 million in 1975-76,  7-5 million in 1976-77 and 10 million in each of the years 1977-78 and1978-79 as a means of achieving a level of Depart-ment of Industry expenditure within the overallceiling set.Concorde14. The estimates, which are  22-2 million lessthan in Cmnd. 5519 revalued over the period1974-75 to 1977-78 are based on the currentlyauthorised production programme of 16 aircraft, andthe development work necessary to achieve a certi-ficate of airworthiness for the British Airways/AirFrance aircraft. However, the future of the projectis under review.RB21115. Provision has been made for the agreed pro-gramme for the development of the RB211-22, andthe production of the first 555 engines. Comparedwith Cmnd. 5519 revalued the estimates allow forGovernment liability for warranty claims under anagreement recently concluded with the company.Provision is made in 1974-75 only for continuedlimited development of the RB211-524. further expenditure on this will be subject to Ministerialconsideration.Other aircraft projects and assistance16. The estimates provide for expenditure on theM45H engine and the HS146 aircraft, and for administration costs of MOD(PE). The expendi-ture is partly offset by receipts from levies on sales of civil aircraft, engines and spares.  No provision has been made for unapproved aircraft or aero-engine projects or for further working capital forRolls Royce (1971) Ltd.National space programme17. The forecasts assume a small continuingnational space programme. But no provision hasbeen made for new commitments on extramuralwork to be entered into beyond 31st March 1976,for which further Ministerial approval would berequired. For 1975-76 a reduction of  0-2 millionhas been made to the planned forecasts in order tokeep within the goods and services ceiling for theDepartment of Industry. This involves a slightly lower level of activity at RAE and some re-phasing of other expenditure.International space programme18. The forecasts provide for the United Kingdomcontributions to the new European Space Agency forprogrammes on applications satellites, maritimesatellites, space lab, and Ariane launcher.Atomic Energy Authority research and development,etc.19. Expenditure on reactor research and develop-ment is shown in Table 4 as  266 million over thefive-year period. This forecast provides for continu-ing development work in support of the AdvancedGas-Cooled Reactor (AGR) at present under con-struction and makes some provision for further development of an advanced thermal reactor. Thescale of expenditure here depends on the choice ofthermal reactor for future installation. If it were decided to go for the Steam Generating HeavyWater Reactor (SGHWR) as the next generation of nuclear power stations the provision should suffice,but if work also continued on the High TemperatureReactor (HTR) it would not be enough. Thegreater part of the forecast expenditure is oncontinued development of the Fast Breeder Reactor.Provision is also made for research on such projectsas plasma physics, fusion research, general reactorsafety and radioactive waste disposal; this too isclosely related to the nuclear power programme.Receipts from customers reduce the net call on expenditure in a number of these instances.(See also Table 5.2 which includes investment bythe Generating Boards on nuclear power stations.)Atomic Energy Authority other expenditure20. From 1975-76 the forecast relates entirely tothe sale of uranium ore (purchased by the AEAon behalf of the Government) mainly to theElectricity Generating Boards.
Nuclear services of the Department of Energy21. Most of the expenditure under this heading- 28 million over five years is in support of the demonstration phase of the collaboration betweenthe&apos; United Kingdom, West Germany and theNetherlands on the centrifuge project for enrichinguranium. The support is not expected to be neededbeyond the end of the period.GENERAL SUPPORT TO INDUSTRYSelective assistance to individual industries, firms and undertakingsSection 8 of the Industry Act 197222. Apart from 1974-75, the only provision madeby the Department of Industry is for the existing scheme for assistance to the wool textile industryannounced to the House of Commons on 19th July1973 ( 15 million maximum). No provision ismade for new projects. The Department of Energyhave included provision for payments underthe Offshore Interest Relief Grants Scheme which is designed to reduce the disadvantage United King-dom firms have in competing for business on theContinental Shelf because ECGD finance cannot begranted. The amount allowed for the five-year period is  35 million.Assistance to ICL23. Provision is made to 1976-77 for the balanceof the  40 million approved assistance to ICL.The forecasts provide for recovery from ICL of 7 8-million in 1978-79.Iranian oil24. Provision is included for the financing of theAnglo-Iranian Oil deal showing a debit of  24million in 1974-75 and a credit of  28 million in1975-76.   .Promotion of tourism25. Although the expenditure on tourist projects in Development Areas under Section 4 of theDevelopment of Tourism Act 1969 is a transferpayment and should be subject to reductions in parallel with those on goods and services the figures have been left at Cmnd. 5519 revalued levels pend-ing consideration by Ministers of the programme analysis and Review on Tourism. Up to 1975-76provision is. included for assistance to the hotelindustry under Part II of the same Act. Grants in aid to the English and Wales Tourists boards and the British Tourist Authority are included ata level slightly lower than in Cmnd. 5519 revalued.mm      - &apos;Refinancing of home shipbuilding lending26. The figures provide for the refinancing ofpart of the guaranteed credit made available bythe banks at a preferential fixed rate of interestCONFIDENTIALto United Kingdom purchasers of ships built inUnited Kingdom shipyards. They include provisionfor the phasing-out by the end of 1975-76 of therefinancing commitment assumed in earlier years bythe Bank of &quot;England. The refinancing works inconjunction with the arrangements for export creditrefinancing (see paragraphs 39-42). The underlyingnet lending for home shipbuilding is expected toincrease, but in real terms the amount of refinancingrequired is expected to fall after 1975-76. There isa contingent liability to the clearing banks in respectof interest similar to that mentioned in paragraph 42in respect of export credits. This amounts to 21 million.Assistance to the shipbuilding industry27. There are variations compared with Cmnd.5519 revalued due to slippage in assistance toGovan Shipbuilders and Cammell Laird. Furthersupport for Cammell Laird will almost certainly be required to enable it to complete its redevelop-ment programme.Other support services28. The heading covers mainly residual items andafter 1974-75 the forecasts provide only for loanrepayments, e.g. the Industrial Investment scheme on assistance to the aluminium industry andrealisation of assets of the Industrial Reorganisa-tion Corporation. In 1974-75 provision has beenmade by the Department of Trade for advances tothe National Film Finance Corporation. Repay-ments of advances are included in the later years.Investment grants29. The forecasts for the payment of grantsagainst outstanding commitments are little changedfrom those in Cmnd. 5519 revalued and  0-5 million (net) is included for 1978-79.SUPPORT FOR NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES(OTHER THAN THE transport industries)Assistance to the coal industry30. The figures shown in Table 4 assume thatafter this year assistance to the National coal board (NCB) will be confined to continuing pay-ments at broadly their current level for grants ofa Social nature. (Redundant Mineworkers Pay-ments Scheme, early payment of retirement pensions, increased pension and other grants inconnection with pit closures.) No amounts areincluded for operating grants to the NCB to coverfuture deficits on current account, since it is assumed that the industry will be able to raiseprices sufficiently to cover its costs. For the current year it is assumed that the industry will be able toraise   its   prices   in   the   autumn   by   about15
8 per cent on top of the increases of about 20per cent already announced for October. If theBoard are prevented from making these further increases a subsidy currently estimated at up to  100million (after payment of coking coal subsidy) willbe heeded. Provision of  150 million is included inthe expectation that the NCB and the Unions will agree to a scheme proposed to compensate sufferersfrom pneumoconiosis, and that the Government willhave to relieve the NCB of the cost. The NCB&apos;scapital expenditure is included in&quot; Table 5.1.Compensation for price restraint31. Under the Statutory Corporations (financial provisions) Act 1974, compensation for the effects of price restraint is payable to the Post Office andthe gas and electricity industries. The amount ofcompensation is based on deficits incurred on revenue account. For the period 1970-71 to1972-73 it was  145-8 million at outturn prices,equivalent to  187 0 million at Survey prices.About  360 million at outturn prices willbe needed in respect of 1973-74; the large increase over Cmnd. 5519 is mainly due to increases in price of oil and the effects of the coalminers&apos; strike. For 1974-75, the estimate is about 490 million at outturn prices on current assump-tions (end May) about cost and price increases.The. total of  850 million compensation for1973-74 and 1974-75 together means that legisla-tion will be necessary to increase, the limit underthe. Act of  500 million.32. Legislation will also be needed to cover the 110 million presently estimated for 1975-76, whichassumes that the industries will increase their prices to the fullest extent allowed under the currentPrice Code and contain their deficits at the same level as in 1972-73. Any compensation in later years will depend mainly on prices policy.33. Programme 5 (Nationalised industries capitalexpenditure) gives details in the relevant FinancingTables of the forecast deficits of each of these industries and comments on the price increasesassumed and their implications for the forecasts.Other compensation34.  20 million is included for compensation tothe gas and electricity industries for the additionalinterest payments which they incurred throughbringing forward investment projects in 1971-72and 1972-73 under the Governments programmeof accelerated investment. Provision is also madefor the recently announced scheme for payments of re-adaptation grants to redundant steelworkers. Overthe period 1974-75 to 1977-78 the forecasts, whichare still tentative, are  0-8 million higher than in cmnd. 5519 revalued.Safety and product quality /35, The forecasts assume that the responsibilities of the Department of Energy for gas examining,gas and electricity meter testing, safety and health in mines and quarries and Nuclear Inspectorate willcontinue at about their current levels.Other services36. The estimate of  5 million over the five-year period assumes that expenditure on oil storage for civil purposes will continue at current levels and includes small payments to the Government of the isle of Man as their percentage of the oil and gasroyalties from the Continental Shelf.-,-;rr . ;*&apos;(&apos;?&apos; 1&apos;iiv;/,  &apos;INTERNATIONAL TRADEExport promotion37.&apos; Expenditure from 1975-76 onwards is esti-mated at about  0 - 4 million a year higher than in cmnd. 5519 revalued but it is assumed that these increases will be offset or more than offset by the;increased charges for services.Trade co-operation38. Provision is made for subscriptions to inter-national trade organisations.Refinancing of fixed rate export credits39. This expenditure covers net refinancing by the exports Credits Guarantee Department of advances made by clearing banks, at a preferential fixed rateof interest, in respect of exports financed on credit of two years or more i.e. mainly heavy capital goods where contracts involve large cash outlays andlengthy periods of manufacture and payment. Thecurrent fixed rate scheme, operative since March1972, covers home shipbuilding too (see para-graph 26 above): under the scheme the ECGD andthe Department of Industry finance, on a pro ratabasis, lending by the banks for these two purposes in excess of 18 per cent of their current accountbalances. Refinance for export credits is shown inthe table separately from refinance for shipbuilding.40. The forecasts for export credit refinance thusdepend on highly speculative assumptions about the phasing of export contracts and the growth of bankdeposits, and are even directly affected by the fore-casts of shipbuilding credit. The downward trend ofthe figures reflects, not a forecast decline in fixedrate export credit business (which is growing apace),but a prediction that the annual variation in thegrowth of this business, net of repayment, will be exceeded in real terms by that of the relevant pro-portion of banks&apos; current account balances. (Thefiguring also assumes continuation of the existing policy whereby the banks get 100 per cent guaran-tees in respect, of advances which they make. Achange in this policy is under review however.)
41. In the figures up to 1975-76 is included a blockof refinance provided by ECGD in replacement ofthat provided by the Bank of England under earlierarrangements, which did not count as public expendi-ture. Some rephasing of this business from 1973-74accounts for almost half the  48 million increase inthe overall totals shown here for the four yearsstarting 1974-75, as compared to the revaluedCmnd. 5519 provision; the rest of that increase is mainly attributable to revised forecasts for ship-building credit (see the first sentence of para-graph 40 above).42. The current fixed rate scheme provides for theinterest payable by the banks on ECGD refinanceto be adjusted so that the banks receive the differ-ence, in respect of unrefinanced advances made bythem, between the preferential fixed rate paid onthese advances and an agreed rate reflecting themarket rate. The original assumption in thisarrangement was that the balance due after adjust-ment would still be in ECGD&apos;s favour, the Depart-ment having been advised that it lacked powers tomake payments of this kind to the banks. however the unexpectedly rapid rise, since March 1972, ofboth interest rates and current account balances hasled to a situation in which substantial arrears are due to the banks under this interest adjustmentarrangement. With the agreement of the Secre-taries of State for Trade and Industry negotiations are in train to reach a settlement with the clearing banks on these arrears. The arrears inrespect of export credits currently total  70 million:the eventual payment, under powers yet to be deter-mined, is likely to fall in 1974-75, but cannot at thisstage be reflected in the figures.REGULATION OF DOMESTIC TRADE ANDINDUSTRY AND CONSUMER PROTEC-TIONProtection of innovation43. Provision has been made for the Patent Officeand associated international subscriptions, includingthe European Patent Office. Net forecasts for thePatent Office, which are lower than those in Cmnd.5519 revalued, assume that receipts will be increasedby Order from 1977-78.Regulation of trading practices and consumerprotection44. Provision is made for the Department ofTrade&apos;s Insurance, Companies and InsolvencyDivisions. The forecasts assume that CompaniesHouse fees will be increased by Order from 1976-77and that these increases will yield additionalreceipts of  2 million a year. Expenditure by theDepartment of Prices and Consumer Protectioncovers the cost of the Monopolies and Mergers Corn-mission,  support for the National  Council ofCONFIDENTIALSocial Services (NCSS) and expenditure on the pro-motion of the activities of Local Advisory Centres.For the NCSS, excesses for 1976-77 and later yearsover Cmnd. 5519 revalued reflect the decision ofthe previous Government to increase the grant-in-aid: but for 1975-76 the increased provision hasbeen reduced from  0-6 million to  0-35 million tokeep within the ceiling laid down. This would entailmore than halving the extra grant which NCSS havebeen promised.Standards and quality assurance45. The mairi item of expenditure under this head-ing is support for the British Standards Institution(BSI), which receives grant equal to the subscriptions-tions and donations received from industry andother sources, plus a supplementary grant. With theagreement of BSI the supplementary grant was tobe phased out evenly over a three-year period( 0-375. million in 1974-75,  0-25 million in1975-76 and a final payment of  0-125 million in1976-77) thus reducing substantially the supportenvisaged in Cmnd. 5519 revalued. To keep withinthe limit set for the Department of Prices and Con-sumer Protection in 1975-76 will involve the com-plete withdrawal of the supplementary grant in thatyear. This will have a serious effect on the standards-Writing Work of the BSI arid a potentialeffect on exports.FUNCTIONING OF THE LABOUR MARKET46. This programme aims to improve the func-tioning of the labour market through the employ-ment, training and other labour market services provided by the Department of Employment. it includes expenditure by the Department of the environment on job centres, skill centres andindustrial rehabilitation units; also by local authori-ties on the Careers Service.47. Under the Employment and Training Act 1973the Manpower Services Commission (MSC) was setup on 1st January 1974. The Training ServicesAgency (TSA) was brought under the Commissionon 1st April 1974 and the&apos; Employment ServiceAgency (ESA) will follow on 1st October 1974. TheCommission is financed by grant-in-aid and its expenditure together with that of the Agencies is included in the provision for this programme./ 48. Certain of the Departments schemes for train-ing, employment transfer and rehabilitation of the disabled are eligible for assistance from the Euro-pean Social Fund. Such receipts are taken infoaccount in the net contribution to the e.c., etc. (see table 2).Manpower Services Commission49. Under the Employment and Training Act 1973the Commission is required to make proposals tothe Secretary of State for the performance of the17
functions laid upon it. It is the Commission^responsibility within its total budget to determinepriorities between the objectives of the Agencies.The Commission has been looking at the TSA&apos;future plans, which are based on the provision in cmnd. 5519, but has not yet been able to considerthe ESA&apos;s plans. The Commission has not, there-fore, yet reached any conclusions on the futureallocation of its overall budget. The revised pro-gramme figures in this Survey, therefore, have hadto be allocated provisionally by the Department ofEmployment but the Commission may in due coursewish to adopt an alternative allocation.Employment Services and industrial rehabilitation50. The main expenditure under this heading is onthe placing service of the Employment ServiceAgency. Over 40 job centres have now been opened and the scale of their activities is still rising.If resources are reduced below the levels of Cmnd.5519 revalued the continuing programme ofrehousing and improvements, formerly 100 a year,will need to be cut back to 75 a year. Moreover,developing the full potential of these job centreswill have to be phased over a longer period.51. The specialised placing services for disabledpeople are under review. Trials are currently takingplace to determine the best line of development forassessment units for disabled and socially disadvan-taged people. Plans to introduce such units on a wide scale will need to be scaled down (possibly by about 40 per cent).52. Responsibility for youth employment matters(now known as the Careers Service) has passed tolocal authorities in England and Wales; scotland will follow in May 1975. Future provision istherefore to be made under Rate Support Grant; the reduced resources available will only be sufficientto meet about two-thirds of the increase in the needsof the Service (mainly in the Further Educationsector).53. Provision has been made to continue theEmployment Transfer Scheme on the present basis.Industrial training54. The Training Services Agency (now responsiblefor implementing the Governments policies on industrial training) continues to expand the TrainingOpportunities Scheme.55. The forecast in Cmnd. 5519 of the numbers to be trained in 1975-76 will be slightly affected.Cuts made in December 1973 and the further reduc-tions in this Survey will have a cumulative effect in later years so that the numbers to be trained in1977-78 (previously forecast at 77,000) will be lim-ited to about 71,000 and there will be little increasein 1978-79.56. The programme provides for funding from 1st April 1975 the administrative expenses of Indust-rial Training Boards, the cost of certain key trainingactivities and the cost of providing training services to sectors of employment not covered by the Indust-rial Training Boards. The resources available forthis will increase less rapidly over the Survey period,with consequent slowing down in the rate at whichkey training activities and training in the areas not covered by the Boards can be stimulated.Redundancy Fund payments57. The decrease in numbers receiving redundancy payments in 1973-74 was greater than that envisaged in Cmnd. 5519 revalued and the variations between different years were even more pronounced. In1973-74 about 157,000 received payments comparedwith some 242,000, 280,000, 388,000, 262,000 in theyears 1969-70 to 1972-73. Future provision is assessed on the basis of 250,000 payments.Industrial relations and other labour market services58. This item consists of the cost of Department ofEmployment staff engaged on general manpower,economic policy (manpower), incomes and industrial relations work together with the cost of the Officeof Manpower Economics, the Industrial arbitration board and industrial tribunals. The abolition of theCommission on Industrial Relations is taken intoaccount as well as the new costs arising from theTrade Union and Labour Relations Bill. provision is also included for the additional costs likely to arise from the establishment of an independentConciliation and Arbitration Service.CENTRAL AND MISCELLANEOUS SERVICESEmployment59. This programme covers Department ofEmployment expenditure on services for theseriously disabled and occupational safety and health services, international relations work (mainly the subscription to the International LabourOrganisation) and central and miscellaneous services.The latter represents central and common servicesnot attributable to other employment programmes and the net cost of agency services. I60. The provision for services for the seriouslydisabled consists mainly of grants towards the costof Remploy Ltd. local authorities and other bodiesproviding employment under sheltered conditions.The forecasts in Cmnd. 5519 revalued are unlikely to be significantly affected by the reduction in thisSurvey. Reactions to a consultative document onthe future of sheltered employment are under con-sideration.61. The shape of the future system relating to the health, safety and welfare of people at work will depend on progress made with the Health and Safety
at Work etc. Bill. Provision is made for action toset up the new machinery which is envisaged butlimitation will mean that no improvement in facilitiesunder the new Commission and Executive will bepossible in 1975-76 and subsequent progress will be slow.62. Some provision is made for a Royal Com-mission on Income Distribution but not for the pay board.1      :i &quot; -:&apos;Other63. The provision for the Department of Prices and consumer Protection includes the expenses of thePrice Commission up to 31st March 1976, when theexisting legislation expires. The forecast for 1975-76is  0-4 million higher than the amount included in cmnd. 5519 revalued, but in order to keep withinthe limit set for the Department in that year it isnecessary to reduce that forecast by a further  0 - 3 million. This reduction will involve cutting staff,and will force the Commission to restrict the numberof cases which they could investigate in depth andwill limit the extent to which the provisions of the code and the Prices Act could be enforced.64. Provision has been made for the transfer ofsome staff from MAFF in connection with food subsidies.65. Provision has been made for central and mis-cellaneous services of the Department of Energy,Department of Trade and the Department of In-dustry. The amount for the latter includes thecost of common services for the Department ofTrade and the Department of Prices and consumer protection.CONFIDENTIAL 19

Unlike most other programmes of public expen-diture, the capital expenditure programmes for the nationalised industries are designed to meet con-sumef demand for goods and services on a com-mercial basis. In this they are more akin toproductive investment in the private sector and ministers therefore agreed that they should not besubject to formula cuts in 1975-76 and later years.However, the cuts in the programmes for 1974-75of   the   non-fuel   industries,   announced   on
17 December 1973 by the former Chancellor of theExchequer, have largely been maintained. (the fuel industries were exempt from those cuts seeparagraph 3 below.)2. The programmes of the various industries for1975-76 and the years following have been string-ently assessed by Departments, with regard to com-mercial needs and with special attention to the likely contribution of each industry to the growth of productive capacity and to - the balance ofpayments. Several programmes have been cutbelow the levels submitted by the industries, forexample, Electricity (England and Wales), PostOffice, the Freight and Bus industries. some industries themselves took the initiative in sub-mitting programmes which were generally lower than those in Cmnd. 5519 revalued, either as aresult of estimating changes for realism or followingre-assessment of their programme in the light ofexpected reductions in demand, for example, Steel,Airways, Airports and Scottish Electricity. british railways propose substantially increased invest-ment but, as explained in the discussion of this programme below, the Treasury consider that itshould be cut. The Coal and Gas programmes aresignificantly increased to provide for the develop-ment of new supply sources in this country and fromthe North Sea.3. On this basis, expenditure on fixed assets in theUnited Kingdom is forecast to increase from  2,190million in 1974-75 to  2,765 million in 1978-79, anannual rate of growth of 6-0 per cent. This rate of growth is to some extent exaggerated by the depres-sion of the 1974-75 figures, which were cut by 276 million in December 1973, and the rate of growth between 1975-76 and 1978-79 is 3-0 percent. For the first four years the comparison withCmnd. 5519 revalued, and amended in 1974-75 forthe December cuts is   million1974-75  1975-76  1976-77  1977-78Cmnd. 5519 revaluedand adjusted . 2,021 2,542 2,570 2,612Survey Report.      .      2,190      2,534      2,718      2,679+169        - 8     +148       -1-67Of the increases in 1974-75 nearly  80 million is attributable to the new coal plan, to extra invest-ment to exploit North Sea Gas, and to revised fore-casts by the Central Electricity Generating Board;about  50 million is simply a switch of Railways&apos;infrastructure expenditure from the Surface Trans-port block and so is not a net increase in expendi-ture; and the balance represents a moderation for employment reasons of the cut originally imposed onthe Post Office.confidential. Total capital expenditure (which also includes,for example, investment abroad, changes in valueof stocks and purchases of private sector companies)is forecast to rise from  2,236 million in 1974-75to  2,752 million in 1978-79, an annual rate of growth of 5-3 per cent. The comparison withCmnd. 5519 revalued, and amended in 1974-75, is   million	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78Cmnd. 5519 revalued				and adjusted	2,037	2,531	2,574	2,608Survey Report .	2,236	2,516	2,706	2,657	+199	-15	+ 132	-f49Significant changes since Cmnd. 5519 are the pro-visional plans of British Steel and the NationalFreight Corporation to increase respectively their expenditure on company securities and their invest-ment abroad.5. Actual expenditure on fixedN assets continuesyear by year to fall short of the sum1 of forecasts for individual industries. The provisional outturn for1973-74 shows a shortfall of about  150 million on the total of estimates in Cmnd. 5519 revalued.This is a closer correspondence between forecast andoutturn than has been achieved in many earlier years. In view of this, and because of the cutsalready imposed in December 1973, the allowance of 100 million made in recent Surveys has beenretained for 1974-75. The individual forecasts for1975-76, however, imply a very large increase in expenditure over the level in 1974-75. This is partly because of the cuts in the earlier year; butthere must be some doubt whether so large anincrease will prove to be feasible. Therefore a shortfall  of  150 million has been allowed in1975-76. For the following years the customaryallowance of  100 million has been included.6. The whole of the capital expenditure pro-grammes of the nationalised industries net of sales of assets, counts as public expenditure. However, asubstantial part of the cost of the programmes ismet by the industries themselves from internalresources, mainly depreciation and revenue sur-pluses. On present conventions, movements in thesesurpluses do not in themselves affect the total ofpublic expenditure; but they do have a bearing onthe level of demand in the economy and on the borrowing requirements of the public sector. More-over the ability of several industries notably gas,electricity and the Post Office to finance their investment programmes has been seriously affectedin recent years by Government measures of price21
restraint: a change in prices policy can increase orreduce their internal resources by several hundreds of millions of pounds a year.7. It has therefore been thought desirable to give some account this year of the financial prospects ofthe various industries. Financing tables have accordingly been included in this Report. Becauseof the difficulties of forecasting trading resultsseveral years ahead, they cover only 1973-74 (pro-visional outturn), 1974-75 and 1975-76. No figures are shown for British Railways pending financialreorganisation on the basis of the Railways Bill; andfor this reason there are no total figures for theindustries together. The implications of the financing tables &quot;are discussed at the end of the com-mentary on each industry; and particular reference is made to the assumptions of further price increases which in turn affect the forecasts of grants, to revenue support and borrowing.8.

National Coal Board1. The National Coal Board&apos;s (NCB) activitiescomprise mining (collieries and open-cast), ancillaries(e.g. coke-ovens), trade undertakings and participa-tion in offshore exploration and production ofhydrocarbons.2. The level of investment in mining embodied in cmnd. 5519 revalued was based on the assumption of a continuing fall in production. It amountedto some  70-80 million a year of capital expendi-ture. Following Arab action over oil supplies and prices that is no longer realistic. Ministers havecommissioned a tripartite examination of the coalindustry which will be concluded later this summer.Pending the Governments decisions on the coalindustry&apos;s future in the light of the examination,Departments have agreed that for purposes of thisSurvey the level of mining investment should be consistent with the NCB&apos;s Plan for Coal.3. The Plan visualises the maintenance of outputat broadly its current level of 135 million tons ayear, of which 120 million are deep-mined. ThePlan proposes the creation of 42 million tons ofadditional annual coal capacity to replace capacity which will be lost through exhaustion in the period to 1985. In the Survey period, investment of  136million has been included for this purpose overand above the normal level. (The total cost ofadditional investment associated with the Plan for coal in the period to 1985 is estimated at  600million. So much of the extra expenditure will fall outside the period.) The additional investment willenable the capacity and the lives of some existingpits to be extended. It will also enable new minesto be opened. These have much longer lead times and higher capital costs. Although for Surveypurposes it is assumed that the NCB&apos;s generalstrategy should be in line with Plan for Coal,individual projects will continue to be appraised bynormal standards. On the assumption that the priceof oil remains close to its current level, there isexpected to be demand for all the coal productionenvisaged in the NCB&apos;s plan. The capacity created by the Board&apos;s additional investment proposals should produce fairly low-cost coal, so that if inthe event oil prices fall making coal less competi-tive, the closure of the highest cost existing pitswould be more economical than cutting back new capacity.4. Expenditure on the Board&apos;s open-cast operations of about  14 million is included over the survey period. This figure assumes the continuation of theBoard&apos;s existing policy of employing outside con-tractors to carry out open-cast activities. It is however proposed to expand opencast output fromits current level of&apos; 10 million tons to about 15million tons by 1978-79.   The NCB are also considering a policy of direct involvement in open-cast, which could involve additional public expendi-ture of about  25 million to 1978-79, which hasnot been included.5. The figures for investment in non-miningactivities do not include investment in joint enter-prises which remains at a token  1 million a year.Provision is therefore included in the Survey for expenditure no higher than the Cmnd. 5519 revaluedfigures. Expenditure for exploration and develop-ment relates only to existing North Sea licences andmakes no allowance for expenditure, arising fromany fresh licensing round. Nor does it make allow-ance for the development of any future discoveries in existing licence areas. The estimates amount to 117 million over the Survey period and show a significant increase on Cmnd. 5519 revalued. Thisis due mainly to the discovery in the last year of oil in three fields where the NCB are in partnership.6. Financial assistance to the industry under theCoal Industry Acts is included in the section on trade, Industry and Employment.7. The NCB incurred a deficit of over  300 million in 1973-74. About half of this was the result ofthe coalminers&apos; strike, while the balance (whichwas covered by assistance under the Coal industry act 1973) related to the Board&apos;s ongoing deficit on current account. To cover the deficit due to thestrike the Government has undertaken to providea special grant to the NCB of up to  150 million,but very little of this was drawn during 1973-74as the Board was temporarily in cash surplus.This special grant is therefore included within thefigure for Government grants in 1974-75. TheBoard&apos;s deficit and need for Government assistanceduring 1974-75 have been substantially reduced asa result of the increases in the price of industrialcoal announced in March, which were designedto yield  270 million during the current year. Thefigures in Table 5 1 (2) also assume that the further increases in the price of domestic and industrialcoal announced in the Budget will go ahead in theautumn and increase revenue by a further  130million. On the basis of the Board&apos;s latest revenueprojections, these price increases are expected toleave the Board with a deficit currently estimatedat up to  75 million, of which about  25 millionrelates to social costs currently reimbursed by theGovernment. (A further  25 million of government grants to redundant and retired mineworkers do notscore as part of the NCB&apos;s deficit.) On the assump-tion of no further price increases after those planned for the autumn, a deficit of about  160 million isprovisionally estimated for 1975-76.Electricity Council and Boards (England and Wales)8. The main determinants of investment in electricity supply are the forecast growth of simul-taneous maximum demand (SMD) and the level ofunit sales expected, which in turn are related to
expectations of economic growth. In recent years,the annual investment of the industry has fallenas the load forecast has been reduced each year over the last decade. This year the electricity industry has been unable to make a firm forecast of the growth in SMD on the grounds of uncertain-ties about the economic outlook and about futureprice relativities with respect to other forms of energy. The Electricity CounciFs provisional 1974forecast is lower than the 1973 forecast underlyingCmnd. 5519 as indicated below.	1973		1974		Electricity Council		Electricity Council		forecast		forecast		Units required		Units required		(million	SMD	(million	SMD	kwh.)

The latest Department of Energy forecast of growth in SMD results in higher electricity demandthan that provisionally adopted by the electricity council for 1979-80 and 1980-81, although mar-ginally so for the latter year (Department of Energy60,200 MW.; Electricity Council 60,100 MW.). Theindustry&apos;s capital investment proposals take intoaccount the Councils provisional 1974 forecast,which is accordingly recommended as the basis forthe current Survey. However, the Department con-sider that the Central Electricity Generating Board&apos;s(CEGB) assumption of 5^ per cent annual demandgrowth after 1981 is unrealistically high and that itwould be reasonable to assume a lower demandgrowth path associated with a 3 - 3 per cent averageGDP growth rate after 1980. On this basis theDepartments forecast is 3,800 MW. below that ofthe CEGB by 1985.10. Expenditure on generation, accounting for asteadily rising proportion of the programme,depends primarily upon the forecast for SMD for six/years ahead of the expenditure year, i.e. for thewinter when capacity started in any one year canbe brought into service. But other factors must betaken into account. A planning margin of capacityover the forecast is necessary to allow for variationsbetween actual demand and forecast, for plantbreakdowns and for adverse weather; while aseparate allowance is made for delays in the plannedcompletion of plant. The figures in the programmerelate to a planning margin of 20 per cent adoptedby the Electricity Council in 1970. The industryis considering whether this planning margin needs to be raised, given uncertainties about the demandforecast, future plant availability and constructiondelays.11. The CEGB has recently made proposals for extending the time period for the construction andcommissioning of new stations and has suggestedthat investment approval for new stations shouldbe given six years, instead of five years, ahead ofthe commissioning of the first unit for conventionalstations, and seven years ahead (instead of six) for nuclear stations. This time scale, which is builtinto the industry&apos;s programme for Survey purposes,but is still subject to Ministerial approval, is designed to reflect the fact that in practice recentpower stations have not been commissioned in lessthan six years. The CEGB also wish to commitconstruction of a new station from the start of the design phase, whereas under recent arrangementsdesign contracts have been placed with manufac-turers before there is a firm commitment to go ahead with a new order. If approved, theseproposals will bring forward by a year the time bywhich a firm commitment needs to be given,although they are unlikely to have any significant effort on the profile of expenditure on power stations.12. In order to meet the load forecast for 1979-80,the Department of Energy&apos;s recommended pro-gramme includes provision for a 2,000 MW. oil-fired station at Littlebrook, Kent, and for orders in1974 for the Dinorwic pumped storage station in north Wales (approval has already been given forthese two stations); Orders for a further 420 MW.of gas turbine capacity (in addition to 700 MW.recently approved) to meet peak loads are also in-cluded. Provision is also made for Drax II, a new2,000 MW. coal-fired station in Yorkshire, to be ordered in 1974 coming on stream in 1980. Thefigures also reflect the latest assumptions about therelative proportions of additional fossil and nuclearstation orders during the Survey period and theordering pattern implied by the expected growth in demand.13. This programme differs substantially from that proposed by the industry; in particular it assumesa smaller nuclear component and therefore a more substantial fossil programme. In addition, Drax II(coal-fired) replaces in this year&apos;s ordering pro-gramme the oil-fired station at Killingholme includedby the industry and Inswork Point put back from1974 to 1975. The changes also take account of theDepartments views on load growth after 1981. the amended programme included in Table 5.1 (1) forthe CEGB is about  232 million lower than thefigures in Cmnd. 5519 revalued, and rises fromCONFIDENTIAL25
 363-7 million in 1974-75 to an estimated  584million in 1978-79. The CEGB programme as submitted to the Department was  309 million morethan the Cmnd. 5519 revalued figure.14. The programme of the Area Electricity boards have not yet been finally assessed by the Depart-ment of Energy, but they are more dependent uponforecasts of localised demand and economic activity two or three years ahead. The programmeremains fairly constant, running at between about 160 million and  180 million a year. There isa reduction in all years in this component of theestimates compared with Cmnd. 5519 revalued( 116 million in total) reflecting mainly the reduc-tion in the short-term demand outlook and the localstructure of demand, which Area Boards haveargued forcibly affect their capital investment deci-sions much more than general national forecasts.15. The programme for the industry as a wholenow put forward totals  3,242 million for the period1974-75 to 1978-79, which is  357 million less thanthe Cmnd. 5519 revalued total. The changes to theCEGB programme envisaged by the department will, however, need to be discussed and agreed withthe industry.16. The electricity industry incurred a deficit of 177 million in 1973-74. With regard to 1974-75,domestic and other quarterly tariffs were increasedby an average of 30 per cent from 1st May.On the basis of current tariff levels, but assuming the industry continues to operate fully fuel costadjustment clauses for quarterly-billed consumers,the industry would incur a deficit of  210 million in1974-75. But this figure will be reduced by some 25 million if the industry increases its industrialtariffs by 5 per cent from 1st July (which has so far been approved only in principle). On the otherhand, the deficit could rise if the industry is unableto recover fully the effects of the autumn coal price increases announced in the Budget. For 1975-76the deficit could be reduced to  20 million if area boards raise all tariffs by an average of about 7 percent in addition to continuing to operate fully fuelcost adjustment clauses.Scottish Electricity Boards17. Although they are separate statutory bodies,the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board(NSHEB) and the South of Scotland electricity board (SSEB) plan and operate their generatingsystem as one. In considering the pattern of overallinvestment it is, therefore, necessary to view the programmes together.18. The main determinant of the generating capacity required for the Scottish system is the forecast maximum demand on the system. TheScottish Electricity Boards&apos; 1974 forecast of maxi-mum demand on the mainland system in averageweather conditions is :Megawatts (MW;)1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	7975	1979	1980-74	-75	-76	-77	-78	-79	-80	-815,570*	6,436	6,811	7,252	7,687	8,137	8,612	9,097* Actual winter maximum demand not adjusted to averageconditions nor to take account of restrictions during powersupply emergency;19. The forecasts are considerably below those contained in last year&apos;s Report, showing a reductionof over 700 MW. on the 1973 forecast for 1980-81.These lower forecasts are attributable to the recentincreases in electricity prices and the expected slower rate of growth of the economy. The greater partof the reduction in demand has taken place in theSSEB area. The reduction on the NSHEB forecastwould have been greater but for the demand-creating effects of North Sea Oil developments. iTheforecasts have been discussed with the Boards andare considered reasonable for planning purposes.20. With the adoption of the lower load forecaststhe Scottish Electricity Boards&apos; current construction programme will now provide sufficient generating capacity to meet demand up to 1981-82. Theyhave, therefore, deferred the investment provisionfor the additional capacity which will be requiredafter 1981. No approvals for new generating capacity are required this year, but provision hasbeen included for a nuclear order in 1975.21. This has resulted in the SSEB investment pro-gramme for the four years to 1977-78 being reducedby some  25 million compared with Cmnd. 5519revalued, although this saving is concentrated in the later years of the Survey. Expenditure by SSEBin 1974-75 exceeds the Cmnd. 5519 revalued pro-vision owing to the late commissioning of theBoard&apos;s nuclear power station at Hunterston andthe rephasing of the provision for the conversionof two SSEB coal-fired power stations to oil or gasfiring. The reduction in SSEB expenditure over thefour-year period is partially offset by increases inthe NSHEB programme totalling  22 million. Thisis the result of increased costs of the Board&apos;s oil-fired generating station at Peterhead, additionaltransmission expenditure and expansion of thediesel plant programme necessitated by oil-associated development in the Islands.22. The Scottish Electricity Boards incurred atotal deficit of just under  13 million in 1973-74.Tariff increases effective from the beginning of Junewere restricted at the Governments request to anaverage of 26 per cent for NSHEB and 29 per cent for SSEB. Assuming a further coal price increase of20 per cent from 1st October 1974 and no furtherelectricity price increases this year, the 1974-75deficit is expected to be about  15 million. Withregard to 1975-76, further increases in tariffs of
about 20 per cent would be required in mid-1975 to enable the Scottish Boards to earn thesmall surplus on revenue account in 1975-76 fore-cast in the table,.British Gas Corporation23. The level of investment by the British GasCorporation (BGC) is very largely determined by thevolume of natural gas reserves the industry plans to absorb and their rate of absorption. Last yearBritish Gas concluded contracts to purchase allreserves economically recoverable from the Friggfield which straddles the median line with Norwayin the North Sea. Export of gas from the Nor-wegian side of Frigg is subject to approval by theNorwegian Parliament and the Norwegian Govern-ment has now recommended that it be granted.24. Gas from the Frigg field main reservoir will raise the volume of contracted reserves from 23 to30 trillion cu. ft: (over 1,000 million tons of coalequivalent). This would increase annual gas sup-plies from 14,000. million therms (50 million tons ofcoal equivalent) in 1974-75 to 19,000 million therms(68 million tons of coal equivalent) after 1977-78 or16 per cent of estimated primary energy input in1978.   ^     -25. In accordance, with existing policy of maxi-economising the contribution to the country&apos;s energyrequirements from secure indigenous sources, BGCare negotiating for oil-associated gas from the Brentfield. The timing Of this gas is tied to the oil production schedules. This purchase, together with further quantities which may become available under the Frigg contract, would increase totalreserves to some 37 trillion* cubic feet. Forecastannual supplies on this basis could exceed 23,000million therms (82 million tons of coal equivalent)in the early 1980s and are as follows:million therms1972	1973	1974&apos;	1975	1976	1977	1978-73	-74	-75	-76	-77	-78	-7911,000	12,000	14,000	16,000	17,000	20,000	22,000Absorption of this gas under the terms of the con-tracts will more than meet the needs of the premiumdomestic and industrial markets and will lead to considerable sales into the non-premium or bulkenergy markets from the late 1970s mainly displac-ing oil, unless a more conservationist approach is adopted. Production plans for the fields under con-tract allow only a certain flexibility in supply.Conservation would involve reducing the flow of gasfrom fields in the Southern Basin but would notsave expenditure since the transmission capacity forthis gas has already been built. &apos;* Million million,     &apos;CONFIDENTIAL26. In.view of the likelihood of BGC getting these additional supplies and in view of the lack of scope for effecting savings by reducing the rate ofabsorption, Departments have agreed that for thepurposes of the current Survey the figures should bebased on the estimated cost of absorbing and mar-keting gas related to contracted reserves of 37trillion cubic feet. Without these additions of.7 trillion cubic feet the industry&apos;s investment pro-gramme would have been broadly in line with theprovision in Cmnd. 5519 revalued. The cost ofabsorbing and marketing the additional gas supplies is estimated at  360 million of which  312 millionfalls within the Survey period. Approximately twothirds of this expenditure represents, additionaltransmission capacity to bring the gas southwardsfrom the shore terminal in Scotland; the balance&apos; represents the cost of. strengthening the regionaldistribution network. The additional outputobtained at this cost is equivalent to that of up toten 2,000 megawatt power statioris.27. The rapid buildup expected in Frigg gas from1976-77 under the contract made it necessary forBritish Gas to decide oh a suitable marketing-approach for absorbing the new . supplies. BGCchose to build up premium sales in the two preceding -ing years, in preference to expanding sales to thenon-premium market. Premium sales, which include a larger element of heating involve high levels of winter peak demand and the strategycould lead to supply problems. if for any. reasonFrigg gas were delayed. As an insurance measure to safeguard against breakdown of supply tocustomers in the winter of 1976-77, BGC are pro-posing to take action to boost peak supplies of natural gas from the Viking field and to convertmore town gas plant to produce substitute natural gas. Provision for these measures, which will costaround  20 million has been included in 1974-75and 1975-76.28. For the first time expenditure by the North Seasubsidiary is included in the Survey following itsconsolidation in the new form of accounts agreed forthe Corporation. Expenditure on fixed assets by the subsidiary which runs at between  7 and  24million a year over the period relates to the develop-ment of North Sea oil and gas discoveries.29. The cost of converting -appliances to burnnatural gas (almost  140 million at outturn prices in the review period) is not included in the figures in Table 5.1 (2) but is reflected in the industry&apos;sgross trading surpluses. As a result of delayscaused by the industrial dispute early in 1973 andthe temporary suspension of conversion in theNorth Thames region during the winter of1972-73 the conversion programme is nowscheduled for completion during 1977.27
30. The British Gas Corporation incurred a deficit of  41-5 million in 1973-74. If tariffs were in-creased by an average of 10 per cent overall (for commercial and industrial tariffs from 1st July,for domestic tariffs later in the year), the deficitiri 1974-75 would be reduced to  19-5 million. Asimilar round of increases in 1975-76 would resultin the deficit of  12&apos;-1 million shown in Table 5.1(2).Failure to raise tariffs this year would increase the1974-75 deficit to  45 million which would rise to 120 million in 1975-76 if tariffs remained at theirpresent level. . 15.2.

The British Steel Corporation^ programme re-presents the first stage of their 10-year development and modernisation strategy. Since last year theyhave translated their broad strategy into detailedproject plans and this has led to substantial esti-mating changes and forecasts much lower thanin Cmnd. 5519 revalued for their capital invest-ment in the United Kingdom.

The investment is intended to raise steelmakingcapacity by about 3-1 per cent a year from itspresent level of 27 million tonnes to 32-33 milliontonnes by 1980-81 and 35-36 million tonnes by1983-84. By 1978-79 modernisation and expansion
at i Llanwern, Scunthorpe, Ravenscraig, and thefirst stages at Teesside and Port Talbot will havebeen completed as will the expansion of specialsteel capacity in the Rotherham and Sheffield area.The second stage of expansion at Teesside and port Talbot will start before the end of the period.It is expected that, with competition from the e.c.,imports will maintain their present share of 12 percent of the home market but that exports will risemore quickly than in the past reaching 30 per cent of total production by 1983-84 compared with some20 per (cent in 1972-73.3. The amounts shown for investment abroad andfor expenditure on company securities are subject to review. The Secretary of State for Industry hasencouraged the BSC to review the opportunities for domestic acquisitions and diversification but itis difficult to forecast with any precision the pat-tern of this expenditure until plans are further de-developed. He is also reassessing the Corporation^policy for investment overseas and this could leadto revision of the current assumptions.4. bsc&apos;s provisional financing figures show a fallin their forecast surplus from about  50 million in1974-75 to about  30 million in 1975-76. Thisresults in part from the expected downturn in world demand for steel. It assumes that the average priceof home sales and of exports will be about 10 and5 per cent higher respectively than in 1974-75 though the timing of the increases has yet to be de-cided. Oh this basis, BSC will be meeting about 200 million of their total capital requirements from their own resources in 1975-76 with the bal-ance of  250 million to be borrowed.5.3.

Post office. The telecommunications capital programmeaccounts for over 90 per cent of the total capitalexpenditure for the five years to 1978-79. Thechief objects of the programme are to expand the telecommunications system, to improve the quality of existing services and to meet the demand for new services. For these purposes invesment willbe made in new exchanges, extensions to existingexchange buildings and equipment, enlargement oflocal line network to customers&apos; premises and in-creased cable capaciy for telephone and other tele-communication services.2. Demand for telephone exchange connections isexpected at a level of between 1*3 to 1-7 millioneach year. The main determinants of demand arethe cost of the service compared with the cost ofother goods and services, and the rising demand fortelephones from lower income groups. The level ofthe charge for connections, and to a lesser extent the rental charge, has a dampening effect on de-mand but needs to be changed frequently ;to main-tain the effect. The Post Office wish to plan invest-ment to secure a waiting list of not more than50,000 by 1978-79 and to contain the waiting listduring the period to a maximum of 250,000.3. The Post Office wish also to improve the efficient-ency of the service through elimination and reduc-tion of call failures due to congestion and plantdefects; to complete STD and extend InternationalSubscribers Dialling; and to improve facilities for business customers including Telex. Much of the investment is directly cost effective. New connec-tions produce new revenue and make more econo-mic use of the network as a whole.  145 million is included for international services, and  73 million for telex facilities, both of which are highlyprofitable.4. Over 70 per cent of the postal programme willbe devoted to the replacement of buildings that willhave to be given up or which are seriously deficientin space, and to buildings to provide service in newareas of population growth. The pace of lettermechanisation is geared to replacement of build-ings which satisfy these criteria. The Post Officepropose to mechanise 52 Letter Offices by 1978-79,which would leave 14 outstanding to complete itsplan; mechanisation of parcel offices is planned tobe completed by 1978-79. Mechanisation, whichaccounts for 17 per cent of the programme, will reduce manpower. The importance of this aspect isunderlined by the fact that services are currently being dislocated by shortage of staff. Its imple-mentation depends on co-operation by the Unionof Post Office Workers (UPW) which is being with-held whilst the union seeks to secure a greatershare of the financial benefits from mechanisationfor its members. Some 10 per cent of the invest-ment is for replacement and growth of the motor vehicle fleet, and for office machines.5. The UPW is planning to hold a special con-ference in October at which its attitude to mechinisation-sation will be considered. If the conference decidesin favour of continuing the policy of withholding co-operation, the mechanisation plans, and the provi-sion for them in the expenditure estimates, will need to be reconsidered.6. As a consequence of the cuts in investment in1974-75, the level of investment proposed by thePost Office for 1975-76 is about 7 per cent below that in Cmnd. 5519 revalued. The figures in Table5.3(1) above represent a further reduction of  10million (to about 8 per cent ybelow Cmnd. 5519revalued). For 1976-77 onwards, the figures are about  15 million a year below the levels proposedby the Post Office.7. The financing table takes account of the postaltariff increases already approved with effect from24th June 1974 (amounting to 20 per cent overall,including lp and ^p on the minimum 1st and 2ndClass letter rate), and of the increases in telecommunications-munication charges (19 per cent) from datesbetween June and September 1974 which are still being considered. These tariff increases were approved by Ministers on the basis of estimates,reflected in the Budget Statement, that the PostOffice deficit would thereby be reduced from  136million in 1973-74 to about  50 million in 1974-75.On the latest estimates, however, there may be a deficit of approaching  200 million because of (a)delay in introducing the new telecommunicationscharges, (ft) a prolonged strike affecting the issueof telephone bills, leading to additional charges for working capital and adding to bad debts and(c) the decision to allow the Post Office to negotiate a relativities settlement for its staff. (Item (c) wasconsidered too hypothetical a possibility to take into account in the earlier  50 million estimate.The current  200 million estimate assumes anoperative date in July.)8. The financing table assumes further tariff Irisesin 1975, involving inter alia a l p increase in eachof the minimum letter rates and a 10 per cent increase in telecommunication charges. On this basis, the Post Office deficit in 1975-76 is forecast at some  80 million compared with the  200 millionnow estimated for 1974-75. Over the two years1974-75 and 1975-76 45 per cent of the capital requirements would be met through self financingand grants for compensation for price restraint.

The investment programme of the british airways Board (BAB) is substantially below that in cmnd. 5519 revalued. Previously BAB had assumed an average annual increase in trafficgrowth of 11 per cent. The recent rapid rise in fuel costs has required a sharp increase in tariffs and while it will be several months before theeffects on demand can be weighed with confidencethe present assumption is that only marginal growth in demand may be expected over the next twoyears after which the Board envisage a returntowards past rates of growth. To take accountof these revised assumptions the Board has dropped from its programme six Boeing 747s and threeLockheed Tristars.confidential. About 80 per cent of the programme is for thepurchase of aircraft for replacement and expansion.European Division expect to buy thirteen Tristarsduring the period, of which the first five will be delivered in 1974-75 and four more in 1975-76.It is assumed that the Overseas Division will takedelivery of ten Boeing 747s within the period and make down payments on a further six. It is alsoassumed that at the end of the period  26 million will be spent on replacement of the RegionalDivision^ fleet of Viscounts. There is an increasein provision from  2 million to  11 million forhelicopters to be used mainly in support of north sea oil and gas operations.3. Subject to the outcome of the current review ofthe project, Overseas Division now expect to intro-duce the first of their five Concordes early in 1976.31
If Concorde were cancelled BAB would not propose to order any alternative aircraft. Theexpenditure on Concorde assumed in the pro-gramme is:  million1974-75	1975-76	1976-77,     &apos; 5	51	334. The financing forecasts show a markeddeterioration in 1974-75 mainly because of fuelcosts but partly because of the May strike of cabinstaff. Some recovery is forecast for 1975-76 whenBAB estimate that they will contribute about  80million from their own resources to their total capital requirements of about  180 million. Theyare assuming average increases in revenue per mileof 25 and 6 per cent in 1974-75 and 1975-76 res-respectively and they will be looking for increases in fares as necessary to meet this target.British Airports authority. The estimated total expenditure by the british airports Authority (BAA) in the five-year period is  127-5 million. Of this sum about  50 million will be spent at Heathrow, a further  50 million at Gatwick and approximately  11 million atEdinburgh with the balance being spent at Stanstedand Prestwick. No provision is included forMaplin, or for alternative developments to otherBAA airports should Maplin be cancelled, or forany airports which the BAA may acquire duringthe Survey period. In total the forecast iis ofslightly less expenditure than assumed in Cmnd.5519 revalued (and with provision for Maplindeducted) but with  2-9 million more in 1975-76.6. Previous traffic forecasts have been invalidatedby the oil crisis and the provision of new forecastsis a major element in the Maplin review now underway. In the meantime BAA have related their proposed programme primarily to the number of passengers whose air journeys begin or end at the airport concerned because, unlike in previous years, they now believe that passengers rather thanaircraft movements are the main determinants oftheir investment needs in the period.

The provision in Cmnd. 5519 reflected the conclusions of the review of future long-term policy for the British Railways Board announced by the then Government in November 1973. Itallowed for a continuing programme of track invest-ment, the introduction of high-speed diesel trains,improvement to the freight business, developmentof the Advanced Passenger Train and investment in non-railway businesses. In addition expectedexpenditure on the Maplin and Channel Tunnel raillinks was included.confidential. The Board have this year proposed a higherprogramme than that in Cmnd. 5519 revalued to offset the investment lost through the cuts in1974-75 made by the last Administration.3. The Minister for Transport has drawn attentionto the difficulties of reducing the programme forBritish Railways investment in 1975-76 to 1977-78below the levels implied by the previous Govern-menfs November 1973 statement and included in cmnd. 5519 revalued, and by the Board&apos;s proposals.Apart from the political difficulty arising from the commitment of the previous Government, there are33
now increasing requirements to provide for coal and freight traffic and these would add to the diffi-culty of making a significant cut in investment. TheChief Secretary, however, has pointed out thatthe railways&apos; investment programme was as provi-sional as other programmes and that decisions onthe levels of expenditure on capital investment and revenue support would inevitably have implications for other public expenditure programmes. ministers agreed therefore that the railway programme shouldbe considered along with other public expenditure programmes. Meanwhile the Government has agreed that there should be a broad statementaccepting, in general, the strategies put forward byBritish Rail last year together with an appropriatelevel of investment to implement them, subject to review in the light of the general economic situation.4. At a time when public expenditure, includingtransport expenditure, is being stringently reviewed,the Treasury consider that the figure in Cmnd.5519 revalued should be reduced. British railways are receiving substantial revenue support because etheir operations are not fully commercial. Much ofthe investment would be in the passenger business a business which does not make a substantial contribution to the nation&apos;s productive capacity or to exports.5. The provision in this year&apos;s PESC Reporttherefore differs from that in Cmnd. 5519 revaluedin that:(fir) the figures for 1974-75 have been cut by20 per cent in line with the former Chan-cellor&apos;s statement of 17th December 1973.(b) the figures for 1975-76 have been cut by15 per cent and the figures for 1976-77 and1977-78 by 10 per cent. (Expenditure onthe Maplin rail link has been deleted beforethe 15 per cent cut was made; proposed expenditure on the Channel Tunnel rail link see below has not been cut, although thewhole project is subject to review as partof the re-examination of the ChannelTunnel.)The estimates for expenditure, excluding that onthe Channel Tunnel, in 1978-79 is the same as for1977-78.6. DOE, on the other hand argue, that if reductions of the order indicated above are made, it wouldcast doubt on the Governments statement, that ingeneral the Board&apos;s strategies are accepted. Cer-tainly the Board would consider them incompatible with the strategy.7. Separate provision for the Channel Tunnel raillink has been included as follows:  million1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-794-0	30-7	35-1	59-08. The presentation of railways investment hasbeen changed for this Report, The figures for theBritish Railways Board in Table 5.5 (1) above nowinclude all investment by British Railways, includ-ing that in commuter railways in the conurbations.But the expenditure on railways by passenger transport Executives (PTE&apos;s) and local authorities is determined by them in the context of their overallplans for local transport (and the new TransportSupplementary Grants will be payable, from April1975 onwards, in support of these plans). this expenditure is therefore included in Table 6 and,to avoid double-counting, is shown as a deduction from Table 5.5 (1). The total deduction consists of:(i) Contributions by-PTE&apos;s (included as part of&quot;Other Direct Investment&quot; in Table 6)  million1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-797-2	21-8	29-5	32-0	33-5(ii) Capital grants by local authorities to BRBand other operators (included as such inTable 6)  million1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79&apos;&apos;&apos;;	0-6	1-6	2-6	3-british Transport Docks Board9. The Board has 19 docks which handled 90million tonnes of freight in 1973. The investmentfigures, for the British Transport Docks Boardinclude provision for improvements to the fishdocks at Fleetwood, Lowestoft, Grimsby and Hull,all of which qualify for MAFF grant; the phasing of these projects has been adjusted to hold expendi-ture in 1974-75 and 1975-76 to last year&apos;s levels.Other provision is mainly for development atSouthampton and the South Wales docks and forother projects on the Humber.I10. Investment by the British Transport DocksBoard has been considered together with investment by the local authority and public trust ports (seeparagraph 33 of Chapter 6). For 1975-76 to 1977-78total investment in all ports has been reduced by5 per cent on the Cmnd. 5519 revalued figures.11. Most charges have already been increased onceduring the current financial year by an average ofabout 11 per cent, and further increases of the orderof 6 per cent are likely in the autumn to offset, in line With the price code, increased costs and toenable the Board to continue to operate profitably.
National Freight Corporation12. The provision for the Corporation^ invest-ment in Cmnd. 5519 represented last year&apos;sassessment of their needs mainly for the replace-merit of their vehicle fleet. Now, following the first five years of their existence, the Corporation have reviewed the future prospects of their businessesand have put forward proposals for a major (over40 per cent) increase in their investment. Thefigures in Table 5.5(1) above represent a reduction on the Corporation^ proposals while allowingsome increase over Cmnd. 5519 revalued to enablethem to develop services so as to maintain and improve their profitability. The Corporationrepresents about 10 per cent of a highly competi-tive market; it needs to respond quickly to changingdemand; its investment is closely geared to the cycleof the private sector. The Corporation is alsoproposing a considerable expansion into Europeanmarkets; tentative provision for this is included under &quot; Other capital expenditure &quot;.13. The Corporation increased charges by anaverage of 3-5 per cent in January and 8-1 percent in May. Their general intention is to increasecharges within the limits imposed by the price codeand market conditions.National Bus Company14. The National Bus Company&apos;s subsidiaries,with a fleet totalling some 20,000 buses and coaches,operated nearly 750 million vehicle miles in 1973.Investment provides mainly for the replacement of vehicles which have reached the end of their usefullife, in many cases by vehicles suitable for one-man operation. The present estimates includeonly token provision for expanding their activities in collaboration with local authorities for thedevelopment of public transport services.15. Investment by the National Bus Company hasbeen considered together with investment in busesby the local authorities and Passenger TransportExecutives (see paragraph 19 of Chapter 6). For1975-76 to 1977-78 the investment figures havebeen reduced by 12  per cent below the correspond-ing provision in Cmnd. 5519 revalued.16. Bus fares were raised by about 10 per cent inMarch. In view of cost increases which havealready occurred, an application to the traffic commissioners for further fare increases in august to maintain the viability of the Company is likely.British Waterways Board-17. The long-term policy review by the Boardand the Department of the Environment, mentionedin Cmnd. 5519, is continuing; in particular, con-consultants have been asked to look at the Board&apos;sbacklog of maintenance work. Pending the outcome of the review the provision in Cmnd. 5519 revaluedhas been retained. The Board, which have asubstantial operating deficit, haye not increased charges recently except in very limited cases, andthere are no firm plans to do so at present. but their general intention is to raise charges by about per cent a year, in line with the price code.Scottish Transport Group18. The relatively high estimate for 1974-75, andthe compensating reduction in 1975-76, results from the bunching of expenditure on ships; inparticular, the new roll-on/roll-off ship, expectedto be completed in 1974-75, to provide for the growing traffic to the Scottish Islands. But themajority of the proposed investment over the survey period is for the bus services operated bythe subsidiary Scottish Bus Group. The estimatesassume an average bus life of 15-16 years.CONFIDENTIAL35

Further format changes have been made for thisleport. The main one is to place together expendi-ure by local transport authorities (including localminorities, passenger transport executives, Londoniansport Executive and municipal bus undertaking -:) on roads, car parks, new buses, infrastructurend passenger transport subsidies. This change isade in order to present figures in a way which willfcarallel the new system of Exchequer support to&quot;ocal transport expenditure, under section 6 of thei-ocal Government Act 1974. The Transport Sup-supplementary Grant (TSG), which is to be made tolocal authorities in England and Wales as from 1st April 1975 in respect of their estimated expendi-ture on transport for the year in question, will bea block one for transport purposes generally andwill replace various specific grants, particularly those for principal roads, public transport infra-structure, rural bus and ferry services, and those to passenger transport executives in respect of railpassenger services. In Scotland it is proposed toassist local authorities through an extension of rate support Grant (RSG) and not through TransportSupplementary Grant. The change in the form of grant does not in itself mean any change in thelevel of public expenditure on transport nor in central Government assistance for it.ICONFIDENTIAL39
3. The policies described below are those whichcould be carried out if public expenditure under each of the main headings were reduced in accord-ance with the Cabinefs instructions governing thepreparation of figures here presented. The figures(other than those for oil-related developments) have therefore been produced broadly by the applicationof arithmetical cuts.MOTORWAYS AND TRUNK ROADSNew construction and improvementengland   .4. The programme for new construction of motor-ways and trunk roads (including lighting) has been heavily cut in recent years. It can be exemplifiedby reference to the provision in Cmnd. 5178(December 1972) for 1976-77 of about  430 million(at 1974 Survey prices) for England compared to 265 million now contained in Table 6. This isa reduction of nearly 40 per cent. The reasons forthese reductions include: the switch of resources to housing and the public expenditure reductions of May 1973; the combined effect of a switch ofpublic expenditure from roads to rail and otherreductions made prior to Cmnd. 5519; the reduc-tions announced on 17th December .1973; and thegeneral reductions in Government expenditure withinwhich the present proposals have had to be framed.5. The effect of these reductions is that the pre-vious long term objective for a 3,500 mile network of high quality routes by the early 1980s cannot howbe achieved. It is therefore proposed that withinthe more limited resources which would be availablepriority should be given to road schemes, includingbypasses of towns and villages, which best achieve the objective of creating a more compact nationallorry route network to be completed by the early1980s. This network (about 3,100 miles) would be smaller than the strategic network envisaged in1971 and many other schemes would have to be deferred or foregone. They include ones aimed atgetting traffic out of historic towns, and improvingaccess to development areas, and access to ports.6. The much reduced inter-urban programme nowproposed would give particular emphasis to schemesthat offered fuel savings and to speeding exports.Good roads are vital both to the national economy and to providing for the continuing long termincrease in traffic, both for the transport of goods and for personal mobility. Over 85 per cent ofexisting inland freight and 90 per cent of passengermovement in England is by road. Even allowing forthe transfer of the maximum volume of freight torail there will still be the need for a continuingsubstantial road programme. The economic benefits of new roads are confirmed repeatedly in the evalua-tion of schemes&apos; costs. Further, environmentalbenefits and reduced accidents should result fromdirecting heavy lorries to a minimum lorry network.In the short term, the proposals now put forwardmay also involve under-utilisation of part of theroad construction industry. The DOE regard theproposed programme as an essential minimum.7. The figures put forward this year are reducedto comply with the overall public expenditureinstructions. Compliance with these figures wouldmean delay to many economically and environ-mentally valuable road schemes and the abandon-ment of others. The DOE consider that theexpenditure on feeis, salaries, etc. which is included within New construction and improvement shouldhave been exempted from the formula cuts; arid thatthe estimates for 1975-76 onwards should thereforebe  7-4 million higher in each year.        J.scotland8. Capital expenditure in Scotland in 1974-75 hasbeen reduced by 20 per cent in accordance with thefinancial restrictions announced on December 1973by the previous Government: For 1975-76, andthe later years of the Survey period, there are twocomponents of capital expenditure. The provisionfor schemes directly related to infrastructure foroffshore oil is based on the current estimates of theactual cost of such works, and assumes that work onthe A9 will be carried out over a period of seven years from 1974-75 (see Special Analysis 7).9. The provision for capital expenditure not directly related to such infrastructure is calculated in accordance with the formula. Within the revisedprovision, while the oil-related schemes should beable to proceed satisfactorily there will be substan-tial delays to schemes in other areas. In particular,the Central Scotland Motorway and Dual Carriage-way Network is not now likely to be completedmuch before the end of the decade, and this will to a certain extent reduce the benefits which could have been expected to flow from those parts ofthe system already in use. Many other desirableschemes to improve road links, to replace weakbridges and to effect environmental improvementsby the provision of bypasses in many parts ofScotland will have to be postponed for varyingperiods, in some cases for several years.wales j10. In the view of the Welsh Office, the cuts ontrunk roads and motorways will, if imposed, be particularly serious bearing in mind the lag of the welsh road programme behind the English and scottish programmes; a lorry route network onthe lines envisaged for England would not be attain-able until the late 1980s at the earliest. Heavypayments on the M4 will arise in 1975-76 - 1977-78and these will leave little room for schemes neededelsewhere in Wales. The concentration of resources on this road will not be welcome in other parts ofthe principality but the M4 must be seen as an 1entity as was the case when construction was earliergoing ahead in England.
MaintenanceENGLAND11. The maintenance programme for trunk roadshas over recent years included extra expenditure onbringing the system up to standards proposed inthe Report of the Marshall Committee. The bulkof that special expenditure is now completed butit had been intended to &quot; keep up &quot; to the higher standards achieved by means of additional expendi-ture (about  5 million a year in England). Reduc-tions were applied to the maintenance programme as a whole in May and December 1973. These,combined with those on which the present Surveyhas been carried out, would mean that, withoutincreased productivity, the resultant programme would not permit the continued maintenance of; allroads at Marshall standards. If the reduced level ofexpenditure were continued even for a comparatively short period, maintenance standards, including safetystandards, would be lowered. Greater expenditure would be required for more fundamental repairslater on. The cost of road maintenance in winterhas been kept down in the past few years by a succession of mild winters, but such conditions can-not be expected to continue indefinitely. Further,as the volume of traffic increases there is greaterneed for quick repairs to road structure and equip-ment such as safety barriers, in the interests of safety. Finally, the reduced programme of new construction implies an increasing number of vehicles, especially of heavy vehicles, concentrated on to the more limited network of high qualityroutes now envisaged and described above.SCOTLAND12. The maintenance programme for trunk roadsin Scotland has had to be restricted to the same extent as that in England. The general commentsin paragraph 11 apply equally to Scotland, exceptthat in Scotland very little progress has been made towards bringing the trunk road system up to the stan-dards proposed in the Report of the Marshall Corti-mittee, and within the reduced level of expenditureit will no longer be possible to make progress onthis or, indeed, to keep up normal maintenance tothe standard which would be desirable.LOCAL TRANSPORTGeneral13. With the introduction of TSG in England andWales, and an extension of RSG in Scotland, the detailed scrutiny of individual proposals for thepurpose of determining specific grants will bereplaced by a broader consideration of an authority&apos;swhole transport programme. This will be given inits statement of Transport Policies and Programmes(TPP) which will be submitted to the Secretaries ofState in July each year.   Not all the estimatedC0NFD3ENTIALexpenditure which an authority proposes will neces-sarily be accepted, but once the grant allocation ismade it will be for each authority to determine itsown priorities. Although central Government willcontinue to exercise influence on the expenditure under the Local Transport heading through TSGand a system of borrowing approvals, for the mostpart decisions on spending will be under the direct control of the local authority concerned. CentralGovernment wilf no longer control the detail of alocal authority&apos;s capital programme but will give a block borrowing approval in respect of the acceptedestimate of capital expenditure. Local authorityrevenue expenditure will be subject to influencemainly through the TSG and RSG systems. TPPswill also be introduced in Scotland; capital expendi-ture will be regulated by the specific control intro-duced by the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.14. Because local authorities will, under TSG,have greater ability to decide their own priorities, the divisions of their expenditure shown in this tableshould not be regarded as firm but as showing themain trends expected, especially in the later years.But in the early years of the Survey much of thecapital and current programme is effectively com-mitted. Taken in conjunction with the substantial reductions made to the programmes, there is now very little room for new projects or courses ofaction involving substantial new expenditure in Eng-land and Wales (or indeed in Scotland). The reduc-tions on new construction of local authority roads,for example, have cut the proposed expenditure for1976-77 for England, from about  360 million in cmnd. 5178 (December 1972) to  227 million onthe basis of the present Survey (all at 1974 prices),a reduction of nearly 40 per cent. But in fact thereis likely to be very substantially increased pressure for greater expenditure, particularly for public trans-port, including revenue support for cheap fares. Thelevel and distribution of future expenditure fromrevenue by local authorities is likely to be influenced by the discussions between the Secretaries of Stateand the local authority associations during the rate support grant and transport supplementary grant negotiations later this year. Actual revenue expenditure may therefore prove to be very different from that forecast, particularly that onpassenger transport subsidies. The Secretaries ofState are not committed to the figures shown.LOCAL   TRANSPORT:   CAPITAL   BSVEST-MENTRoads new construction and improvement15. The expenditure figures under this headingrelate to all roads (including lighting) over which local transport authorities have control, includingcertain roads in new towns.41
16. The fall in forecast expenditure on this part ofthe roads programme since 1971-72 reflects cutsmade in response to the national economic situation,but also an intention to rely more on policies whichfavour public transport, including ones to restrain the use of private cars for some journeys in towns.But local authority road improvements serve several important purposes: to make the network more suitable for the traffic it carries; to allow environ-mentaLimprovements; to serve new development; toprovide bypasses for small towns and villages; andto assist bus operation and reduce the impact of heavy lorry traffic. With a reduced level of expen-diture many such schemes will have to be forgone.Car parks ,17.  This includes expenditure on lorry areas.Other direct investment418. This heading includes all investment invehicles, rolling stock and infrastructure by localauthorities (including the Passenger TransportExecutives (PTEs), London Transport Executive(LTE) and municipal bus operators). The figures are considerably below those in Cmnd. 5519revalued. Since much of the expenditure.on infra-structure is already committed, the reduced pro-gramme would require a longer phasing of someprojects, and substantial, deferment of other major projects, and so postpone substantially the important contribution which these projects will make to meeting the movement needs of the major conurba-tions. The reduced programme leaves littlepossibility of a further shift of expenditure to greater emphasis on public transport. &quot;Expenditureon railways by PTEs is included in this programme as well as in the figures for BRB investment inTable 5.5 (1). To avoid double-counting total con-tributions by PTEs and capital grants by localauthorities to BRB and other operators see para-graph 20 below are shown as deductions from the totals of Table 5.5(1).19. The provision for investment in buses by localauthorities and PTEs in England and Wales hasbeen considered together with investment by theNational Bus. Company (see Table 5.5 (1)) and thecorresponding Cmnd. 5519 revalued figures for1975-76 to 1977-78 have been reduced by 12  percent. Similarly in Scotland the provision for invest-ment in buses by local authorities and PTEs hasbeen considered together with investment by theScottish Transport Group and the former has been cut by less than 25 per cent.;7 \5 /v.-.,;:&apos;:.-. - :&apos;&apos;.Capital grants to BRB and other operators20. Separate estimates of local authority capital grants made to BRB and others acting as agents fora local authority are included, for the first time,in Table 6 in order to bring together all localtransport expenditure. The related capital expendi-ture by the nationalised industries is included inTable 5.5 (1) and the element financed by localauthority grant is deducted along with contributions by PTEs to BRB from that Table to avoid doublecounting.LOCAL TRANSPORT: CURRENT EXPEND!-TURERoads maintenance21. The increasing volume of traffic carried by theexisting road system will necessitate even greaterexpenditure on the maintenance to present standards of heavily used roads. The reduced figures in thisReport will not only preclude the raising of standards of maintenance to those recommended inthe Marshall Report, but will also prevent main- jtenance to existing standards on these more heavilyused roads. \Car parks22. Further restraint on the use of cars in urbancentres, together with the provision of some additional parking facilities at strategic points, isan important element in achieving a shift from useof the private car to public transport. Net revenue from parking is shown to increase, but the figuresdepend on the extent to which it will be possible to free car parking charges from price restraint and onthe acceptance by local authorities of the need for increases.Other expenditure23. The major part of this head is expenditure bylocal authorities on road safety education, publicity and training activities.Passenger transport subsidies24. No reductions have been made to the figures which appeared in Cmnd. 5519 revalued. Therewill however be considerable difficulty in persuadinglocal authorities to keep their public transport,; sup-port expenditure within the figures shownIncreasingly, local authorities place greater emphasis on commuter travel by public transport. Many ofthem are disposed to encourage it by restricting fareincreases despite rising costs; some even talk ofproviding public transport free. Such policies wouldhave major implications for public expenditure, withpotentially a very rapid build-up.British Rail25. This subsidy is paid to BRB by PTEs andlocal authorities under section 20 of the 1968 Trans-port Act.
Other26. This item includes the subsidy paid by the glc to LTE and by local authorities to PTEs and municipal operators for urban bus and undergroundservices; it also covers subsidies paid undersection 34 of the 1968 Transport Act to rural busand ferry operators (including private operators andthe NBC).CENTRAL GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIESNationalised industries27. The largest item in this block represents pro-vision for support to the British Railway Board(BRB). Pending the passage of new legislation onthe finances of and method of support for the Board,the estimates of support required are on the same basis as those in Cmnd. 5519 revalued. provision is made for grants under section 39 of the transport act and special grants to meet forecast revenuedeficits. Total subsidies, including indicative sumsfor payments by the PTEs which are included in local transport above, are likely to be   million at 1974 Survey prices	1974	1975	1976	1977	1978	-75	-76	-77	-78	-79Direct support by Central					Government.	230	274	290	298	319Payments by PTEs: Scotland	1	5	5	5	5Others .	12	13	14	14	15	243	292	309	317	339Provision for PTE payments in Scotland is includedon the assumption that the Glasgow PTE will begin to support rail services on 1st January 1975.28. Total provision is considerably above that in cmnd. 5519 revalued; by  35 million in 1974-75rising to  120 million in 1978-79. This reflects the continuing deterioration in the railways&apos; financialposition. The provision assumes rail fare increasessomewhat above price increases generally to take account of improvement in service. If in 1975-76fares and charges were not increased but costs roseby say 10 per cent then the Board&apos;s required subsidy in that full year would be increased by approxi-mately  100 million. f29. Two other industries are expected to requiresupport in 1974-75 and subsequently:(a) the British Waterways Board receives grants in respect of essential maintenance of theBoard&apos;s waterways and on the improvementto modern traffic standards of about 400bridges carrying public roads over the waterways;CONFIDENTIAL(b) the Scottish Transport Group receives grants in respect of operating deficits on the un-economic Western Isles Shipping Servicesoperated by its subsidiary David MacBrayneLtd.OTHER30. The main item is the refund of fuel duty tooperators of bus stage services. Increases in dutyhave been refunded to such operators since 1964but as a consequence of increased prices for motorfuel, full remission of duty, amounting to 22^p per gallon, has been allowed since 12th February 1974.31. Bus operators are expected to continue to benefit substantially from grants towards the pur-chase of new buses for use on stage services whichis their major item of capital expenditure (grant at the rate of 50 per cent is being paid on about,600 such buses each year). These grants stimu-late the development of one-man operation and help the operators to provide improved services by en-abling them to maintain up-to-date fleets. Invest-ment in new buses by municipal bus operators, Pas-senger Transport Executives and the London Trans-port Executive is referred to in paragraph 19 above.Grants in respect of new buses are also paid to theNational Bus Company and to the Scottish Trans-port Group, whose investment appears undernationalised industries capital expenditure in Table5.5(1). In order to avoid double counting, provision is made under the Central Government subsidiesheading for grants to the private sector only. Be-cause of the increased expenditure in recent years,a system is to be developed, in consultation withthe bus operators, of using new bus grants as a means of controlling bus investment.32. Other subsidies include those under the High-lands and Islands Shipping Services Act 1960 forsea transport services in Orkney and Shetland.PORTS AND SHIPPINGPorts33. The provision covers investment by the in-dependent harbour trusts and local authority ownedharbours, and grants and loans to ports in theprivate sector. Expenditure in this area is con-sidered together with port investment in the nation-nationalised industry sector (i.e. by the British transport docks Board see paragraph 10 of Chapter 5.5);Cmnd. 5519 revalued figures, for 1975-76 to1977-78 have been reduced by 5 per cent (exceptfor the provision for North Sea oil see below).There is no provision for port facilities at Maplin.34. Cmnd. 5519 made only minimal provision forport developments to deal with North Sea oil. It isnow known that substantial expenditure on a newport at Sullom Voe in the Shetland Isles, and other43
developments in the Orkneys, will certainly be re-quired. The Sullom Voe development is expectedto be undertaken by the Zetland County council who have recently obtained the necessary powers.No precise estimates are available but public ex-penditure is likely to build up from about  10million in 1975-76 to  15 million in 1978-79 (seeSpecial Analysis 7). No provision has been madefor ports in the Celtic Sea area.35. Grants are payable by the Ministry of Agri-culture Fisheries and Food for the improvementof fishing facilities. Provision is included for grants towards expenditure at the Port of Tyne in 1974-75and 1975-76. In addition, expenditure by the Brit-ish Transport Docks Board at Fleetwood, Lowes-toft, Grimsby and Hull qualifies for this grant see chapter 5.5, paragraph 9.CIVIL AVIATIONCAA grant-in-aid36. The forecasts in Cmnd. 5519 were provisionalpending a review of the Civil Aviation Authority&apos;financial position. . The present forecasts from1974-75 to 1976-77 are higher than those in Cmnd.5519 revalued but the forecast for 1977-78 is about 1 million lower. It has been assumed that theAuthority will be self supporting on revenue account by the end of 1977-78 and no provision has there-fore been made for grant-in-aid in 1978-79.Capital investment by the CAA and local authoritiesCAA37. The greater part of the Civil Aviation Author-ity&apos;s investment programme consists of investment in equipment and installations for the National air traffic Services. The expenditure will provide, interaha, new computers for the automation of flightplanning; modernised or new navigational aids ataerodromes and for en route purposes and new buildings and equipment for regional air traffic con-trol centres. Over the period 1975-76 to 1978-79the forecasts have been reduced in order to keepwithin the overall goods and services ceiling for theDepartment of Trade.Local authorities38. The major development programmes includedhere relate to Birmingham, Manchester and Bristolairports. The present levels of expenditure havebeen calculated in accordance with the goods and services formula.Other civil aviation services39. The main items included here are the UnitedKingdom&apos;s contribution to euro control and the pay-ments made by the Government to airlines and toairport managers in respect of security measures against terrorists and hijackers. The present figuresreflect an increased provision for security costsagreed at the end of 1973, too late for inclusion in cmnd. 5519; these are partly offset by increasedreceipts from euro control.OTHER TRANSPORT SERVICES40. As well as expenditure on central governmentadministration and receipts from fees for drivingand vehicle tests, provision is made for minoritems, including the small amount of Departmentof the Environment expenditure on the prpposedChannel Tunnel. If it goes ahead the project itselfhowever will, on present plans, be financed mainly by private sector loans which would not count as public expenditure.

Housing has been exempted from the general rules governing the preparation of this year&apos;s Survey report.   No cuts have been applied.   On				this occasion the forecasts of expenditure are not confined to &quot;existing policy&quot;, whether of the previous or the present Government, but include						
also the view of the Housing Departments on thecost of continuation into subsequent years, and insome fields the development of the policies adopted at the time of the Budget for 1974-75. The latterelement is noted at appropriate points in the textand the corresponding figures are brought together in a Table at the end. The inclusion of the housingfigures as a whole at the levels indicated in theReport implies no Treasury commitment to theiraccommodation within the total of public expendi-ture.2. The overall provision proposed is very muchgreater than that in the last costings of the previous administration, the increase for 1977-78 being 55per cent. The comparison is as follows:  million	1974	1975	1976	1977	1978	-75	-76	-77	-78	-79Cmnd. 5519 revalued					(previous admini-					stration)	2,323	2,135	2,132	2,093	-1974 Survey    .	3,078	3,076	3,180	3,252	3,346Increase .      .      .	4-755	+941 4-1,048 4-1,159			-3. About two thirds of these increases are due toestimating changes which became apparent duringthe first few months of the year. The main com-components are: (a) increases in subsidy due to afaster increase in housing costs (especially debtservicing) than the prospective increase in rent-income provided for in the Housing Finance Act,(b) an upturn in local authority housebuilding fromthe low level of activity in 1973, coupled with adecline in council house sales and (c) a continuation of the higher level of local authority lending asso-ciated with the shortage of building society funds.In 1974-75 the remaining third is due to the policiesadopted by the Government as part of its immediatespending priorities when it took office; it consistsmainly of additional local authority building andacquisition (including a once-for-all provisionfor acquisition of houses from developers) and includes the effects of the rent freeze. About a third of the increases for subsequent years also provides for the departments views of the waythese policies should be continued and in somefields developed (see paragraph 23).Subsidies4. The total of central Government subsidies andrate-borne contributions to the housing accounts oflocal authorities is equal to the total deficit of allhousing authorities on their expenditure after rentincome (and other minor items of income) hasbeen allowed for. For the years after 1974-75,proposals have been published for the purpose of consultation with the local authority associationswhich it is intended would form the first stage ofCONFIDENTIALthe repeal of the Housing Finance Act, 1972.These proposals would restore to local authoritiesin England and Wales power to fix reasonable rents,and would re-cast the system of housing subsidiesso that they would not in the future be determinedby authorities&apos; rental income. Present subsidiespaid to the Housing Revenue Account would beconsolidated and maintained at their present level;future additions would be determined partly by thescale of local authorities&apos; new capital expenditure on housing (to be subsidised at a rate of 66 per cent),partly by increases in loan charges (to be subsidisedat a rate of 33 per cent) and partly by unusuallyhigh general costs in certain areas (the precisescale and distribution of this element of subsidyis yet to be determined). The rate of growth of subsidy will depend on these three factors. Authori-ties will be free to determine for themselves whatdistribution of their housing costs, after subsidy,would be reasonable as between rents and rates;for the purpose of this estimate it has been assumed that rents, at present frozen, would rise from 1975at about the same rate as prices generally. (Theproportion met from rates will be relevant expendi-ture for rate support grant purposes.)5.  Other assumptions made are:(a) that the local authority average pool rate ofinterest will rise from 9 per cent in 1974-75by stages to 10 per cent in 1977-78;(b) that management and maintenance costs will rise in real terms at about 4 per cent a year;(c) that new investment and Council houses sales. will  follow the  course  described  below(paragraphs 13 to 21).6. Other housing subsidies, i.e. rent rebate andallowance subsidies, slum clearance subsidy and town development subsidy will continue broadlyas at present, although the scale and timing of changes in the rebate and allowance scheme remain to be determined and will slightly affect the out-come. On the assumption about rents stated above(paragraph 4) total expenditure on central Govern-ment and rate-borne subsidies is not expected tobe increased by these proposals compared with what it would have been under the housing finance Act in England and Wales, on similarassumptions about new building and acquisitionsand after taking into account the rent freeze.f 7. New proposals for the Scottish system of hous-ing finance have yet to be put to Ministers. How-ever the Scottish forecasts assume that the extra costof giving local authorities freedom to fix their ownrents will be as follows:  million1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-794	7,...	10	1249
8. The provision for subsidies includes an element in respect of new building and acquisitions by localauthorities under policies the cost of which has notyet been accepted after 1974-75, as well as thepolicy proposal in Scotland.Option mortgages9. The option mortgage scheme is designed to give to house purchasers of moderate income, benefitsroughly equal to those available through tax relief 1on mortgage interest to basic rate tax payers. the forecast reflects the increase in subsidy necessaryfollowing the change in the basic rate of incometax.Grants and loans to housing associations10. The Government has re-affirmed its predeces-sor&apos;s policy of expansion for the voluntary housingmovement but as a complement to extendingmunicipal ownership, not as a substitute for this.The Housing Bill, now before Parliament, contains the legal provision to make this expansion possible.The increased financial assistance provided for bythe previous Government was as follows:       :.c  million1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-7858	84	136	14911.  5 million additional provision to this in1974-75 was agreed in the context of the Budget.Further additions in subsequent years are nowproposed by the Housing Departments as follows,which have been incorporated -in the totals:  million1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79+ 16	+ 13	+ 11	-1-7The Treasury draw to attention that there is nopolicy commitment to these additions.House improvement and slum clearance12. Over a million dwellings in Great Britain areunfit and a further 2 million dwellings are sub-standard, mainly in the privately rented sector. TheGovernment is firmly committed to the long-standing policy of financial assistance throughimprovement grants. The estimates for Englandare substantially the same as those in Cmnd. 5519revalued. However increases are proposed inScotland in investment by local authorities in theimprovement of their own houses. An increase inthe programme of 15,000 approvals in 1974-75 wasagreed as an immediate priority at the time of theBudget and&apos;this results in an addition to expendi-ture in 1975-76 of  33 million. A continuingaddition of the same order giving an annual rateof 20,000 approvals from 1975-76 onwards is nowproposed. This would involve additions to existingestimates of  36 million a year from 1976-77onwards.   This remains for policy decision.Investmentengland and wales13. The figures in Cmnd. 5519 revalued assumed that the decline of local authority housebuildingover recent years would continue and provided for only about 64,000 new approvals by local authori-ties in 1973. In practice however they approvednearly 84,000 new dwellings in 1973 and the fore-casts require amendment to take account both ofthis and of the explicit encouragements already given by Housing Ministers to local authorities tobuild more.14. The trend at the beginning of this yearindicated a level of approvals of at least 85,000 in1974, and the additional provision made explicitlyas part of the Budget announcement allowed forapprovals by local authorities to rise to 96,000 in1974-75. New Government policies on localauthority housing programmes in England andWales were set out in DOE circular 70/74 (welsh office circular 111/74) which drew attention to theserious decline in the provision of new council houses over recent years, and the evidence from many areas that waiting lists have lengthened whilethe number of vacancies available to local authori-ties for re-letting have fallen. The forecasts assume that English and Welsh local authorities willrespond to this state of affairs and that approvalsin 1975 will also be at a level of 96,000 rising to101,000 in subsequent years, though there has sofar, been no acceptance of the cost of continuingthis policy after 1974-75.15. The circulars also set out the governments policies on the acquisition of houses. First, becauseof the shortage of mortgage finance, an exception-ally large number of houses under construction orrecently completed in the private sector have notbeen sold. A special provision of  146 million in1974-75 has been made to enable local authoritiesin England and Wales to acquire houses of ap-propriate standard and price and which are in theright places to meet urgent housing needs. It is not proposed to repeat this in future years.16. Second, as part of the Governments policyof developing the municipal ownership of rented accommodation, the circulars invited local authori-ties to draw up programmes of acquisition for the
period 1974-75 to 1978-79, concentrating on theimmediate relief of housing stress, the need to safe-guard tenants from threats of eviction and harass-merit, and the problem of homelessness. For1974-75 a provision of  50 million was agreed and included in the Budget. In the DOE and welsh office view additional provision of  100 million ayear is a minimum requirement for the rest of the survey period bringing the total of public expendi- &apos;ture oh municipalisation to  140 million a year ascompared with  90 million in 1974-75 and an esti-mated  40 million a year as the underlying level ofexpenditure by local authorities on the purchase ofexisting dwellings immediately before this.i17. The Chancellor said in his Budget speech inrelation to the 1974-75 provision for municipalisa-tion that this expenditure could not be given suchhigh priority as steps designed to add significantlyand quickly to the stock of housing. There is nopolicy commitment to the level of expenditure sub-sequent to 1974-75.NEW TOWNS18. The provision for housing investment in new towns is substantially unchanged from earlier esti-mates. An exception is the proposed expansion ofCwmbran New Town in Wales. This is estimated to cost about  12 million over the whole survey period. The Department of the Environment hasunder consideration changes of policy on disposalof existing assets which might have the effect of reducing receipts from this source.SCOTLAND19. Approvals of new dwellings fell to an historic-ally low level in 1973 and there are now signs of recovery. The situation is complicated by the exist-ence of an unusually large number of the newdwellings approved in the last year or so which havenot yet been started. The Department think thattaken together, the starts resulting from new ap-provals and the starts resulting from existing out-standing approvals, will result in a peak of expendi-ture in the next two or three years. Thereafter amore normal relationship between approvals ofabout 22,000 a year and starts of a similar orderwill be restored resulting in somewhat lower annual expenditure. However it is agreed that the situationin the next year or so will need to be kept underreview both to ensure that capacity in the industryis not over-stretched and also to monitor the pos-sibility of expenditure falling short of expectations.APPROVALS OF NEW HOUSING: (includingLocal Authorities, New Towns and the Scot-tish Special Housing Association)20. The following table shows the number ofapprovals in the years 1971 to 1.978.Year	England	Scotland	Wales1971 actual	99,070	23,122	3,7001972 actual	75,300	28,567	2,1001973	89,000	11,677	5,2651974       .      .	100,000	20,000	7,0151975       .	100,000	21,000	6,8601976	105,000	21,000	7,0601977       .	105,000	22,000	6,8701978	105,000	22,000	6,700Council house sales   /&apos;21. The forecasts reflect recent evidence of a downturn in the number of council house sales and a greatly increased use of the discounts which localauthorities are allowed to offer their tenants.Cmnd. 5519 assumed that English local authorities would sell 35,000 houses in 1973 and subsequent years. In the event authorities sold only 30,600houses in 1973 and the estimate (for 1974 and sub-sequent years has been reduced to an annual levelof 25,000. This estimate will need to be reviewed again later this year as the current level of interest rates combined with the rent freeze may furtherlessen the financial attractions to council tenants of owner occupation. Between 1972 and 1973 thenumber of council houses sold in Scotland fellfrom 800 to 400 and the estimate for 1974 and sub-sequent years is based on 200 annually. forecasts of houses built for sale have been reduced as com-pared with the figures in Cmnd. 5519 revalued inthe light of experience.Lending by local authorities22. A part of local authority lending is associatedwith council house sales and these figures havebeen reduced accordingly. The major componenthowever is the lending to applicants wishing to buydwellings from the private sector. This is essenti-ally complementary to mortgage lending by building societies and, since 1971, has not been subject toquantitative control. As recorded in Cmnd. 5519 alarge increase in this lending in England and Walestook place in 1973 associated with the shortage ofbuilding society funds. The outturn for 1973-74was  345 million (gross) and there is ho evidence sofar in the current year of any let up in the demands on local authorities for loans for house purchase.However it is the Government^ wish to restore areasonable level of lending by building societies and means of doing this are currently under considera-tion. In the short-term also the loans to building societies of up to  500 million have helped to alleviate the more extreme shortage of mortgagefunds experienced earlier this year. In these cir-cumstances future demand for local authoritymortgages cannot be forecast with any certainty. a figure of  315 million is proposed for lending by
English and Welsh local authorities in future years.The very small provision for this type of lendingin Scotland has not had to be significantly revised.Loans to building societies23. The loans of up to  500 million to be madeavailable to building societies over the summer months, are intended to be repaid before the endof the financial year but this depends on the netinflow to building societies showing a continuingimprovement. The position will need to be reviewednearer the time of publication of the public expendi-ture White Paper.SUMMARY OF ADDITIONS24. The following table summarises the additionsincluded in the foregoing forecasts for the continua-tion and limited development referred to in para-graph 1 of the policies adopted for 1974-75. while at least in the case of new building by local auu\orities fresh action would be needed to forestall this development,&apos; there is no collective acceptance by ministers of the cost from 1975-76 onwards-  million	1975	1976	1977	1978	-76	-77	-78	-79Local Authority new investment   .	61	114	151	151Municipalisation ....	100	100	100	100Subsidies related to the above	6	21	40	60Housing Associations .	16	13	11	7Improvement Investment (Scotland)	-	36	36	36Reduced Rent Income (Scotland) .	4	-7	10	12Total .      .      .	187	291	348	36625. It is recognised that the housing forecasts are subject to a good deal of uncertainty. The Treas-ury&apos;s view, which the Housing Departments do notshare, is that, short of the introduction of new policies, the expected further growth of the pro-gramme may not fully materialise. Account hasbeen taken of this in the allowance for shortfall-see paragraph 19 of the Main Report.

It will however be difficult, with the reductions that havetaken place, to ensure that the expansion of domestic and industrial needs are met and pollutioncontrol improved. In Scotland there will be a slowing down of major projects for sewagetreatment. The oil-related components of theprogramme are unaffected (see Special Analysis 7).Improvement of the environment and local facilitiescapital4. Although increased investment in housing will involve extra demand for refuse collection and disposal, land acquisition, open spaces and townexpansion, provision for these services has been restricted in accordance with the Survey formula.This produces figures for every year up to 1978-79less than in 1973-74.    .5. The severe cuts in this sub-programme overthe last two or three years will make it doubtfulwhether local authorities can provide the minimalservices and facilities for expanding populationor to improve standards in deprived areas.  if. This programme comprises a wide variety of services concerned with public health, improvementof the environment and the development of localfacilities and amenities, most of which are the responsibilities of local authorities. It also includesexpenditure on water and sewerage services, whichin England and Wales are the responsibility ofthe new Regional Water Authorities.Water and sewerage2. On 1st April 1974 responsibility for water and sewerage services in England and Wales passed to the Water Authorities established under theWater Act 1973. The capital expenditure of theWater Authorities is treated for the purpose ofpublic expenditure control in a similar manner to nationalised industries; current expenditure is met from charges and does not feature in the Survey.In Scotland the responsibility for water and sewerage services rests with local authorities, theformer being exercised by water boards.3. The reorganisation of water and sewerageservices in England and Wales should aid develop-ment of further large-scale sources of water, theimprovement of water standards and the effective
the 1975-76 level of expenditure is held to that for1974-75 services may suffer a deterioration becauseof lack of capital investment.6. The greater part of local authority expenditureon the improvement of the environment in Englandand Wales comes within the locally determinedsector under the arrangements for controlling capitalexpenditure introduced in 1971. The locally deter-mined pool may be used to finance capital expendi-ture which is not in a key sector falling under anyprogramme including this one. Local authoritieschoose their own priorities in spending their shares of the pool.7. The Department of the Environment do notbelieve that the housing programme can be pursuedsatisfactorily when local authorities are under suchsevere restraint in providing supporting servicesnot only under this programme but, through theinter-action of the locally determined pool of capitalexpenditure under other programmes, notably roads and education, as well. The Secretary of State forthe Environment therefore wishes to reserve forfurther discussion the question of whether localauthorities can be expected to fulfill their obligations under these conditions. The figures for capital ex-penditure on improvement of the environment take account of certain as yet unallocated reductions inDOE services.CURRENT8. The main expenditure on current services ison refuse, parks and baths, planning services, and environmental health. The figures for 1974-75were severely cut in May and December 1973. Atthe time, local authorities doubted whether on some services they could keep pace with increased demands. To the extent that local authorities fail to achieve the 1974-75 cuts the amount of growthallowed for 1975-76 will be reduced and may not afford any significant development of services.Local authority current expenditure on these ser-vices increases over the Survey period on averageby about 5 -1 per cent a year in England and wales and 4 - 8 per cent in Scotland.9. The Departments believe that in some areasthis would be insufficient to allow for &quot; natural&quot;growth resulting from population and other changes and that there would therefore be a deterioration of standards. For example, some areas could havea less frequent collection of refuse than they donow, while new areas would be faced with lowerstandards of refuse collection than those previouslyexisting. There could also be problems over the rationalisation of incentive bonus schemes for refuseworkers. On the Town and Country Planning side,the restraints on growth could lead to delays indealing with planning applications and drawing upstructure plans: this might lead to a slow-down inland becoming available for housing.   For parks and baths further deferment of maintenance would lead to diseconomies, while a depression of thestandard of sporting facilities would contrast withthe growing public pressure for improvements inthis sphere.New towns industrial and commercial developments10. This heading includes expenditure by NewTown Corporations on land and site servicing forshops, offices and factories in new towns and also,in so far as construction costs are not borne by private developers, fpr some construction costs aswell. There is a link between the rate of expansionof housing in new towns and the provision of jobsfrom new industrial and commercial developments.The reductions in previously planned provisionhave meant unwelcome slowing down and post-ponements of projects in the latter field. Thesituation in future years will depend critically onthe level of the public expenditure allocation.Royal palaces and parks, historic buildings andancient monuments11. This item covers expenditure on the main-tenance, etc., of the royal palaces and royal parksthroughout the United Kingdom. Provision is also made for grants for the repair of historic buildings,for other related services and for expenditure onthe purchase, maintenance, repair and display ofancient monuments, including emergency excava-tions to record monuments before sites aredeveloped.12. Standards of maintenance in the royal parksare already reduced because of staff recruitmentdifficulties and a reduction in the maintenance of royal palaces would be a false economy.13. Expenditure on historic buildings and ancient monuments is spread over a very wide range ofconservation activities and could not be cutarbitrarily. Work postponed would cost more dueto advancing decay and would also result in theloss of buildings and monuments which are part ofthe national heritage and cannot be replaced.14. These items have therefore been protected fromthe formula cuts, but at the expense of other items in the programme.Environmental research15. This item covers expenditure by the Depart-ment of the Environment on its three researchstations, on departmentally sponsored extra-muralresearch and on grants to research associations andother bodies. Application of the formula cutsshould not create insuperable difficulty. They willbe concentrated mainly on extra-mural research work and will probably also affect the level of grantsgiven to some outside research bodies.
Central and miscellaneous environmental servicesspecialised environmental services16. The Sports Council, Countryside Commissionand Nature Conservancy Council provide a small group of specialised central and miscellaneousenvironmental services. They each have an indi-vidual budget. It would be difficult to reduce such services which are provided on a minimal scale.Furthermore, to apply formula reductions to small amounts of money is much more- difficult than in larger programmes where there is flexibility. Theabsence of such flexibility and the necessarily higherdegree of commitment for future years of the totalexpenditure which exists in such a programme, plus the intrinsic importance of these small services, hasled the Department of the Environment to decide that the formula reductions which would fall to bemade here shall be made elsewhere.Land drainage and flood protection17. Land drainage expenditure forms part of theenvironmental services programme. It falls into two parts: the Thames project and all other arterialdrainage.thames tidal flood protection scheme18. The Thames project began to lag about mid-1972 and the consequential slippage, together withextra costs which have been assessed more recently,means that the projections in Cmnd. 5519 revaluedare no longer realistic.  The GLCs consultants arereviewing the future phasing of the project in thelight of the difficulty of placing the five-year contract for the main civil engineering work. Until the out-come of this review is available Departmental offi-officials can make only a speculative estimate of the likely trend of expenditure beyond the current year.The projection for 1975-76 anticipates that expendi-ture will be contained within the formula allocation.It has been assumed however that Ministers will not wish to depart from the policy stated in the House ofCommons on 3rd April 1974, to the effect that theGovernment intended to go through with the project,and provision is made in this Survey at levels sub-stantially in excess of the formula allocations for1976-77 to 1978-79,arterial drainage (including sea defence)19. The level of expenditure included in Table 8will&apos;&apos;make it extremely difficult to carry out a programme of arterial drainage planned on thebasis of defensible priorities, especially from1976-77 onwards. Expenditure arises in three mainareas projects in high flood risk areas, mainly to dispose of the extra run off of surface water whichhas resulted from urban development and road construction; schemes forming part of the infra-structure of essential or important industrial and housing developments which would otherwise be frustrated and work to ensure that arterial drainagein rural areas keeps ahead of the extension of fielddrainage. ;

ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICEThe programme covers expenditure on both higherand lower courts in Great Britain as well as the costs incurred by departments concerned with theadministration of justice.Court services England and wales. The provision for Magistrates&apos; Courts represents the day to day running costs of the courts and capital expenditure on the provision of court build-ings including the replacement of existing buildingstaken over for use as Crown Courts under theCourts Act 1971. All expenditure is the responsi-bility of local authorities, but the Central Govern-ment pays a grant to.them equal to 80 per cent ofthe net approved expenditure. Current expenditurecovers the staff and goods and services necessary to cope with the increasing work load of the courts.In order to keep within the limits of expenditureshown in Table 9 reliance will have to be placed onexhortation from the Home Office by circular tolocal authorities to achieve economies. Previouseconomy cuts in capital expenditure have alreadyled to a situation in which all but the most urgentschemes face delays of three or more years. the reduced provision now made for 1975-76 to1978-79 will have severe repercussions for the courtsservice since by the end of the period it will adda further year to the delay already experienced bymost schemes.3. For the higher courts, the level of capitalexpenditure represented by the figures now providedfor 1974-75 to 1976-77 should make possible thefirst building starts in the programme of essentialnew court accommodation. The rate at which startswill be made will be significantly lower than planned for this programme in Cmnd. 5519, but it can beaccepted as the irreducible minimum. In the twolater years of the period, 1977-78 and 1978-79, thepresent figures would permit further site acquisitionsor new building starts only to the extent of about one quarter and one half respectively of the pro-gramme of new work previously approved. If itwere assumed that in 1979-80 the rate and growth of expenditure were to be maintained at about their 1978-79 levels, the buildings concerned couldbe started 12 months later than planned hitherto.The consequent set-back in completion dates inthe areas affected would subject court business to long delays and inconveniences for one further year in the early 1980s. Moreover, the statutory rights ofuser in many existing court buildings expire at theend of 19.81.4. The amounts for payment of costs in connectionwith Crown prosecutions in criminal and other pro-ceedings in Magistrates&apos; and Higher Courts havebeen increased since Cmnd. 5519 to take account of expansion of the Courts&apos; business. The effect is illustrated in the following table:    million	1974	1975	1976	1977	1978	-75	-76	-77	-78	-79Cmnd. 5519 revalued .	.     7-6	7-9	8-3	8-6	901974 Survey	.     8-3	8-6	90	9-4	9-8These are the most realistic forecasts that can bemade but actual expenditure will be determined bythe number and cost of police prosecutions. net expenditure by the Criminal Injuries CompensationBoard is expected to rise from  4-6 million in1974-75 to  7-1 million in 1978-79 after deductingthe contribution from the Scottish Home and HealthDepartment. The estimates are based on an intake of 13,950 cases in 1974-75 rising to 22,200 in1978-79 which are broadly in line with the assump-tions in Cmnd. 5519. HCourt services Scotland5. From 1st April 1973 the provision and main-tenance of sheriff court houses became theresponsibility of Central Government. Progresshitherto, even in urgently needed improvement ofsheriff court accommodation, had been slow sincealthough partly financed by Central Governmentthe initiative lay with local court house authorities.Only since 1973 has it been possible to plan a forward programme of sheriff court building toprovide for the increased volume of business, forrationalisation in the siting of courts in the lightof population movement, and the long-term effects of local authority reorganisation. The capital programme now postulated will allow the continua-tion of two projects already in hand but would preclude the start in 1975-76 of all but one newcourt house. This will mean the deferment ofschemes in some areas where accommodation isseverely deficient. With the annual growth in business averaging 2 per cent a year it is clear that many courts cannot continue to function so as tokeep the disposal of business within reasonablebounds without resort to further temporary make-shift arrangements which in themselves are inimicalto the dispensation of justice, uneconomic in theuse of sheriffs and staff and inconvenient to courtusers.Legal aid. The object of the expenditure is to make legal aid, advice and assistance available for persons of limited means. The scope of the schemes is fixed by statute, with the result that the level of expendi-ture will depend on the number of qualifyingapplicants. The amount of expenditure is alsoaffected by capital and income limits of eligibility
for legal aid and for legal advice and assistance.It has been agreed to review annually the incomelimits for the two schemes.7. Expenditure over the five-year period is slightly lower than in Cmnd. 5519 revalued because of anincrease in the average time between the grant of legal aid certificates and the presentation for pay-ment of the bills of costs, and because the initialdemand for legal advice and assistance is slightly lower than was anticipated. It is, however, expectedto rise steadily over the period, partly because ofthe annual review of income limits, and partly in line with the upward trends in litigation and thegeneral work-load Of the courts. The number ofcases in which legal aid is granted is expected torise annually by about 2 per cent in civil cases and(based on trends and statistical projections of crimeand the proportion of cases granted aid)by 9 per cent for criminal cases in magistrates&apos;courts and 7 per cent for criminal cases in thehigher courts: The number of instances in whichlegal advice and assistance is given is expected torise annually by 10 per cent.ENGLAND AND WALESTreatment of offendersPRISONS8. The prison population forecasts are underreview. Since the actual population is at present about 2,000 below the level forecast for 1974-75,the Department has-for the purpose of the presentexercise-carried a similar reduction in the fore-cast population through the remainder of theperiod. On this basis the average number ofpersons in custody would rise to 40,500 in 1978-79.9. It is expected that total staff will rise from19,950 to 25,914 in 1978-79. Within this growthit is assumed that there will be an annual increaseof 850 in the prison officer grades.10. , Against the estimate of about 40,000 personsin custody at the end of the Survey the department would see a need for at least 42,000 places in all,giving a margin of 5. per cent over the estimatedpopulation, because of fluctuations in the incidence of committals and variations in the types of offenders sent into custody.11. At present there are some 36,500 placesavailable in the prison system; some 1,500 in existing open establishments are to be given upbecause of the reduction in the proportion ofprisoners suitable for open conditions. Approxi-mately 6,000 additional places will become availablewithin the Survey period from building projects which have already started. With the completionin addition of a much-needed Category B prisonto serve the North Region, the prison system willhave the minimum number of places it needs to cope with the assumed population.12. Successive Home Secretaries have drawn attention to the extent to which the prison service has relied since the end of the war on. its Victorian [heritage to cope with the rising prison population,Of the existing stock of some 36,500 places, about20,000 are in establishments which were built beforethe first world war, with the majority in localprisons in which at present some 12,000 men arestill accommodated two or three in a cell designed for one. These places are generally lacking inamenities appropriate to the 20th century, includingadequate workshops, recreational facilities, associa-tion areas and perhaps most criticised-anysanitary facilities in cells. A further 5,000 of theexisting places are in former war-time hutted camps;many of which are now reaching the point wherethey must either be rebuilt in situ or replaced else-where. Only about 5,000-^or 14 per cent-of theexisting places are in purpose-built post-war Iaccommodation.13. Against this background the Department nowsees an opportunity to use new projects already planned to begin the formidable task of replacingsome of the Victorian prisons. The programme is designed to start on average two major schemes and one or more minor schemes each year over the survey period, with completions in later years. Sucha programme (though smaller than previously envisaged) will enable the Department alwaysprovided that the prison population does not againincrease substantially to contemplate Over the next10 years the closure of some half-dozen or soVictorian prisons which at present account for some3,300 places. If the population did increase it wouldprovide additional places at a rate of about 1,000 ayear.14. The programme would also enable a start on&apos;three or four major redevelopment schemes involving the substantial reconstruction of Victorian prisonson existing sites. The continued use of the localprisons on these sites is in many cases desirablesimply because they are conveniently located toserve courts within their catchment area and becausethe acquisition of a suitable near urban site with similar access to the courts would be almost impos-sible. The redevelopment of these prisons wouldin some cases result in a considerable permanentreduction of the number of persons who could satis-factorily be accommodated on the site. (This is.particularly the case at very large existing prisonssuch as Manchester.) It would also be likely to involve a temporary loss of places while redevelop-ment was in progress, with resultant pressure onthe 5 per cent margin mentioned above.15. Even if the programme envisaged above were successfully completed by the mid-1980s, about i16,000 of the available places would still be in
buildings constructed before 1900 and the Depart-ment sees the need to continue to replace thisobsolete accommodation by a programme of new building and redevelopment over the next 15 to20 years.16. The programme of staff quarters and other non-place producing schemes to improve facilities at existing establishments would continue at a cost ofabout  14 million in 1975-76, rising to  18 million in 1978-79. . The increased expenditure in later years will be necessary to maintain the fabric and services in obsolescent prisons which cannot as yet be redeveloped and to provide some modest im-improvements. Provision will also have to be madefor some 3,800 quarters including those built for new establishments.PROBATION AND AFTER-CARE17. By far the largest element of expenditure inthis programme (about 70 per cent) is for thestatutory grant to certain local authorities towardsthe approved expenses of Probation and After-CareCommittees; about two-thirds of the expenditurecovers probation officer salaries. The remainder ofthe provision is mainly for expenses of training pro-nation  officers; grants to Managing Committees ofprobation1 hostels and homes; grants to voluntary organisations in respect of after-care includinghostels; the grant in aid to NACRO; expenses ofAttendance Centres and of the Parole Board; aid to prisoners on discharge and headquarters administra-tion. ^48. The forecasts allow for continuation of activities broadly on the lines previously envisagedexcept as noted below. They assume that the voluntary movement will maintain the provision ofadditional after-care hostel places at an increased rate of 240 (formerly 200) a year.19. It is now assumed that because of local govern-ment reorganisation the 78 community serviceschemes will be condensed to 50 schemes covering the same areas and the same estimated total cost;from 1977-78 expenditure will be confined to run-ning costs. The programme for day training centreswould be revised so that no expansion beyond thefour centres now operating would be made, whereasit had been intended to expand to about 20 centresby the end of the period assuming that the experi-mental stage proved successful. Development of theprogramme for new adult probation hostels andbail hostels would enable the number of hostel placesto rise from 774 at 1st April 1974 to 2,350 at1st April 1979.20. The previous assumption that the number of probation officers would rise to 5,300 by 1st April1978 has been modified and projected to 1st April1979 as follows:-1 April 1975   .      .	4,420:;,       1976   .             .	4,652;1977   ..      .	5,030,   V ,   1978   .      .      .	5,3621979   . &apos;    .&apos;	.      .      5,750These figures reflect the fact that at the mid-point of1973-74 actual strength was 4,100 (200 more thanoriginally estimated).1 This was partly because 85fewer officers than I had been estimated wereseconded to prison service establishments and partly because a larger number of new appointments weremade and a lower rate of wastage suffered than hadbeen forecast.General protective servicespolice21. Provision is made for the continued build-upof police strengths and for maintaining and improv-ing facilities for training and scientific and technicalsupport. Capital estimates allow for the limitedpurchase of sites and construction of operationalbuildings; the replacement of some forensic sciencelaboratories and police district training centres; theexpansion of the Police College, and continued pro-vision for the Police National Computer. current expenditure provides, apart from the manpowerrequirements, for expansion of the programme of research into police methods, equipment and com-munications; and for equipment of the forensicscience laboratories and police district trainingcentres.22. In the light of recent recruitment trends, theprogramme provides for a lower growth of thepolice service than previously forecast; the level ofexpenditure would involve continued severe restric-tions on police authorities&apos; building programmes.Police manpower is estimated to increase during the survey period from 100,700 to 110,950 and the civilian strength from 41,300 to 48,575. Annualgrowth would be as follows:   &apos;Police Civilians.1974-75 . . 1,500 1,2751975-76 . . 1,875 1,3501976-77 . . 1,875 1,3501977-78 . . 2,500 1,6501978-79 . . 2,500 1,65010,250 7,27523. These assumptions mean that the level ofstrengths which,, on previous estimates, would havebeen reached by the end of 1977-78 would now bereached just over a year later in the case of police and two years later in the case of civilians.
24. Police authorities are entitled to recruit upto the establishments authorised by the home departments and at present actual strength is about14,000 below these. (Cmnd. 5519 stated that ifrecruitment should improve or wastage be reduced,the estimates would be revised and provision would be made for additional expenditure.) Recruit-ment could be restricted only with the co-operationof police authorities, but it is unlikely that thiswould be given.25. The local authority building programme,already retarded as a result of the cuts in 1974-75,would be reduced significantly from previous esti-mates. The level of expenditure would allowapproval for 1975-76 of most of the 40 fully-plannedschemes which were due to start in 1974-75; but many other schemes originally planned for 1974-75,and all those planned to start in 1975-76 (about 7 million) would have to be deferred beyond&apos;1975-76. The longer-term effects are difficult to forecast but the cumulative effect of successiveeconomy cuts must inevitably mean that many policestations and other buildings must remain in use far beyond their proper span.FIRE SERVICES26. The major part of expenditure in this pro-gramme is in the &quot;locally determined&quot; sector andis accounted for by wages and salaries; theprovision of buildings and equipment; and loansunder the Fire Prevention (Loans) Act 1973.Central Government expenditure covers the running costs of the central training establishments;research; the examination of explosives, and central administration costs. Local authorities areresponsible for about 98 per cent of the expenditure.27. The programme does not provide for any increase in manpower beyond the level (26,250whole-time firemen) contemplated in the context of the rate support grant discussions. The reducedlevel of expenditure would allow about two-thirds of the proposed local authority capital programme(including operational vehicles and equipment) tobe fulfilled but would leave no margin for increased costs Of the order of  5 million annually likelyto arise from the introduction of the 48-hourworking week.28. Individual fire authorities are primarily responsible for determining their requirements inthis sector, and the Government cannot significantlyinfluence their expenditure except by generalexhortation or restriction in the rate support grant.Even then it cannot be assessed how far localauthorities would apply restrictions to the Fire Ser-vice as opposed to other locally determined services.Other29. Remuneration of immigration service personnel and headquarters staff with related administrationexpenses constitutes the bulk of expenditure in this category. Some provision is also made for deportation and detention expenses, the immigration appeals Tribunal and a grant in aid to the UnitedKingdom Immigrants Advisory Service.30. The present level of overseas passenger traffic and of casework at headquarters is expected tocontinue to increase substantially over the period and the previously envisaged staff numbers are asfollows:1.4.1974	1.4.1975     1.4.1976     1.4.1977     1.4.19782,555	2,730         2,976         3,244         3,53531.  The reduction cut of:	present  programme  would  require a in staff costs equal to an average staff1975-76	1976-77          1977-78          1978-79326	496              630               801The level	of staffing for 1975-76 and 1976-77would represent a reduction in the actual provisionfor 1974-75 in an area already seriously pressed.The restricted level of starring for 1975-76 onwardswould result in a loss of efficiency in the controlof immigration and nationality matters and would increase the delay in resolving cases.32. Provision is also included for the salaries and administration expenses of the Gaming Board.Civil Defence33. The estimates would permit the continuation of activity, but at a reduced level, in the state ofpreparedness assumed in recent years by successive governments. The decrease in activity will be reflected in Central Government expenditure andwill entail deferments in purchase of equipment,etc. Completion of sub-regional controls will alsobe delayed by up to two years. Provision for localauthority expenditure slightly increases, however, tocover county emergency planning teams followinglocal government reorganisation.Community Services34. The main element of Community Servicesexpenditure is the Urban Programme. To keepwithin the lower level required by the formulathe Urban Programme would run from  18-1 million in 1974-75 to  19-9 million in 1978-79(compared with  18-1 million rising to  21-9,million as previously forecast).   The effect would
be that the value of new projects approved wouldbe reduced by about a third in 1975-76 and later years.35, The rest of the provision is mainly for grants to statutory and voluntary bodies such as theCommunity Relations Commission, Race relations board, WRVS, Marriage Guidance Councils and various voluntary bodies receiving help from the voluntary Services Unit. It is envisaged that thepresent level of activities of these bodies will becontinued!, and that the Voluntary Services grantswill continue at the higher level of about  2 millionapproved for 1974-75. No provision is included for a commission on sex discrimination.Central and Miscellaneous Services36. Salaries and travelling and incidental expensesof Home Office Ministers and headquarters staff notallocated to any other programme compose about84 per cent of this category. The remainder mainlyconsists of general expenses on staff training, con-tract cleaning, telephone, mail services, secondedstaff and advertising.37. The previously envisaged staff numbers are asfollows:1.4.1974	1.4.1975	1.4.1976	1.4.1977	1.4.19782,231    ,	2,326	2,442	2,564	2,692After allowing for the maintenance of general administration and training expenses at adequatelevels, the programme would require a reduction in staff costs equal to an average staff cut of 121 ineach of the years 1975-76 to 1978-79.38. The level of staffing for 1975-76 would represent a reduction in the actual provision for1974-75. The restricted level of staffing for1975-76 onwards would add to the current difficul-ties in fulfilling departmental commitments.Civil emergencies39. In 1973 arrangements were made for a three-year programme for increasing flour stocks from weeks to 12 weeks&apos; supply, in order that thenation&apos;s food supplies could be better secured tomeet any civil emergencies that might arise.Initially, firm approval was given to proceed withthe first year of the programme and provision was included in Cmnd. 5519 for the expenditure arising in. 1973-74. Part of this will now fall to be met in 1974-75 due to unforeseen delays. Approvalwas subsequently given for the second year andexpenditure is now fully committed up to August1975. For the first and second years the additional provision in this Survey is  7-1 million in 1974-75and  1-7 million in 1975-76. A decision on thethird year of the programme is needed for whichadditional provision of  5-9 million in 1975-76 and 2-0 million in 1976-77 will be required. annual expenditure on storage and maintenance from1976-77 is about  0-6 million.SCOTLAND \- ITreatment of offendersPRISONS40. The capital programme is necessary to dealwith the (projected rise in the total inmate popula-tion from 4,790 to 6,000 in 1978-79. At present,1,500 inmates are sleeping two or three to a cell.The programme will provide 1,373 additional places,keeping pace with the projected rise in the popula-tion, with a small improvement in the overcrowdingsituation. The programme also ^provides for anadditional 474 new quarters and &quot;144 replacementquarters for prison officers. The main element of current expenditure is staff costs; the programmeprovides for a projected increase of 1,073 non-industrial staff over the current complement of2,277.General protective servicesPOLICE41. While current recruitment trends would point to a projected net average annual increase of 140 inpolice strength, it is doubtful whether an increase ofmore than 125 would be permitted within the reduced expenditure levels now postulated, whichwould be more consistent with a projected increase from 11,530 to 12,150 over the period. On presentrecruitment trends this would be likely to call inquestion, from 1975-76, the policy of encouragingpolice recruitment.42. Within the reduced capital expenditure project-tions, it will be possible to maintain progress onoperational headquarters for each of the newregional forces, while other operational building will continue though at a substantially reduced pace.FIRE SERVICES43. The estimates assume an annual increase ofabout 75 whole-time firemen.Community Services44. This includes provision for the Urban Pro-gramme which is estimated to rise from  1 - 9 million to  2-4 million, an increase of 26-3 per cent, overthe period.

The calculations of the deductions to be made from expenditure in Cmnd. 5519 revalued have beencarried out separately for each sub-programme-education and libraries, science and arts.

EDUCATION AND LIBRARIESENGLAND AND WALES (including university grants Committee expenditure in Scotland)2. The sums assumed to be available in each year after making the formula deductions from the expen-diture in Cmnd. 5519 revalued (but excluding grants to persons) are:    million	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79Sums available	3,664-7	3,809-6	3,964-0	4,123-83. It is not possible to manipulate the education programme so as to match expenditure exactly tothis pattern of resources but the programmes under-lying Cmnd. 5519 have been modified so as to achieve the closest practicable fit.4. It has proved particularly difficult to remain within the expenditure limit in 1975-76. Evidenceabout the impact on the education service of the cuts in local authority current expenditureannounced last year, and the varying responses bylocal education authorities, throws considerable doubt on the advisability and practicability of postu-lating further savings on forecast recurrent expendi-ture. Consequently capital programmes must once again, as happened last year, bear the main bruntthrough further substantial reductions, though recur-rent expenditure cannot be entirely exempted anda general cut of  25 million in local authority expenditure in 1975-76 only has been assumed.5. In total the measures needed in 1975-76 thusamount to:CAPITAL EXPENDITURE(a) Under-fives. Abolition of 1975-76 starts pro-gramme (with resumption of full programme in 1976-77);(b) Primary and secondary schools. Continuedabolition of all programmes for improvementof old schools;(c) Special schools.   Reduction of Cmnd. 5519starts programme by three quarters (with re-sumption of full programme in 1976-77);(d) Non-advanced further education.

In general these projections, which derive fromthe Government Actuary&apos;s Departments (GAD)1973 birth rate and population projections providefor the numbers of pupils and students expected to// need accommodation in schools and collegesthroughout the period; but (i) the number of under-fives may be an under-estimate (paragraph 9) and(ii) the projection of student numbers in higher education during the later 1970s assumes the adop-tion of a deliberate restrictive admissions policy(paragraph 21). The recurrent expenditure project-tions provide for continuing improvement in pupil/teacher ratios in the schools, but envisage continuedstringency in the level of non-teaching expenditure(paragraph 14).
UNDER-FIVES9. The table in paragraph 5 shows no buildingstarts in 1975-76; building programmes assumed for later years do not make good the consequential lossof places. Pupil number projections, nevertheless,assume a steady growth in numbers towards the1981 aim in Cmnd. 5174 (Education: A framework for Expansion: December 1972) of 90 per cent of four year olds and 50 per cent of three year olds;the cancelling of the 1975-76 building programme would probably result not in a reduction in numbersadmitted but in a lowering of accommodation stan-dards. Revised birth-rate projections due later thisyear may suggest some reduction in the total pro-vision needed to meet the 1981 aim. But the rateof growth in numbers assumed here is, in any case,markedly slower than recent observed trends would support. The Departments operate no directcontrols over the admissions of under-fives; ifdemand for places continued buoyant and if authori-ties continued to try to meet it, recurrent expenditure would significantly exceed these forecasts.PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLSCapital expenditure10. For 1974-75 and 1975-76 the programmeprovides for basic needs only. A basic needs pro-gramme is strictly limited to the additional schoolsplaces necessary to accommodate extra pupils. Itdoes not cover the replacement of accommodationlost through accident or which has become toodangerous to continue in use. Moreover the form-ula used to calculate the number of places requiredto meet basic needs takes no account of the factthat if a building for additional places is to besensibly designed it must often incorporate some improvement of existing accommodation. Althoughexpenditure related strictly to basic needs can be tolerated for a short period, reasonable management of the programmes, requires basic needs to be augmented by a margin of at least 25 per cent.Accordingly for each year after 1975-76 the startsprogramme consists of basic needs plus a 25 per centmargin. 20 per cent of each year&apos;s allocation hasbeen taken as minor works.11. These limited programmes do not provide forthe resumption at any time during the period of the substantial allocation of resources for the replace-ment or improvement of old schools provided in cmnd. 5174. This limitation would bear especiallyharshly on urban areas where there is often littleoccasion for basic needs building but where thereare many old schools. The sub-standard accommo-dation in these old schools will have to remain in use, deteriorating further meanwhile, for much longer than previously announced plans envisaged.Recurrent expenditure12. The estimates assume that there will be510,000 teachers in 1981 which, on the basis ofGAD 1973 projections, would give a pupil/teacherratio in 1981 of 18:1 compared with the cprrespond-ing figure of 18J:1 mentioned in Cmnd. 5174. Ifthe 18^: 1 ratio were retained the number of teachersrequired in 1981 would be about 496,000. With this figure as the 1981 target the number of teachers in1978-79, the last year of the review, would be some480,000 compared with 488,000 assumed for the forecasts and the consequent saving in that year would be about  16 million. Apart from the cur-rent political pressures which would make it diffi-cult for the Government to adopt a lower figure than510,000 there are practical difficulties in the way.First, the total number of teachers is dependentamong other things on wastage rates from the pro-fession. Recent rates provide no basis from whicha reliable trend of wastage might be inferred butthe rates for both 1970-71 and 1971-721 would lead to teacher numbers close to 510,000 in 1981.For this present exercise the higher rate, that for1970-71, has been adopted but, in so. far as it ispossible to make a judgment, lower rates seemmore likely in the future and other things being equal, would lead to a larger number of teachers,Secondly, the accomplishment of an orderly reduc-tion in the numbers of teacher training studentsover the next few years itself leads to teacher num-bers of about 510,000 in 1981. A faster rate of run-down would be unnecessarily disruptive and would run into opposition. The view of the DES is thusthat the theoretical estimated saving in 1978-75of  16 million is not feasible in practice. TheTreasury view is that, despite the possible dintculties, it might be sensible to make savings in this sub-programme for distribution in other parts of the  programme.13. Non-teaching costs are related to pupil numbers derived from GAD 1973 projections of titbirth-rate, and to trends of the numbers of childreistaying on at school beyond the statutory leaving age. A 3 per cent annual increase in unit costshas been assumed from 1975-76 this corresponds to the so-called &quot; improvement factor &quot; of 3 per centreferred to in Cmnd. 5174. This increase is imainljattributable to the bringing into use of new build-ings, to improvement in staffing standards andteaching methods, and to the growing sophisticatioiof equipment; the local authorities have consist-ently maintained that an annual growth in nonteaching costs of this kind is inescapable and thaia rate of at least 4 per cent is needed. Annual outturn figures for recent years have consistentljsupported their contention.14. A 3 per cent rate of growth of non-teachit!unit costs may thus be regarded as the minimadefensible rate.  Since it is derived from base urf68CONFD3ENTIAI
costs which reflect the May 1973 reductions in cur-rent expenditure, the resultant sums might in prac-tice prove inadequate. In that situation some auth-orities to judge from the response to the May and december 1973 cuts would reduce the number of teachers they were willing to employ, while else-where the provision of books and equipment, andthe standard of maintenance and grants would be adversely affected. In addition a large share of thegeneral cut of  25 million in recurrent expenditureassumed for 1975-76 would fall in this area.SPECIAL SCHOOLS15. The starts programmes are those found in cmnd. ,5519 revalued except that for 1975-76 whichhas been cut by three quarters. This would mean that the 1975-76 building programme would pro-vide only an estimated 2,500 new places, comparedwith some 8,000 which would have flowed fromthe original programme, and the loss of all 1,500replacement places. The result would be that some5.50O children who ought to be in special schoolswould have to spend at least another year in ordi-nary schools where it is difficult to fit in handi-capped children without their becoming a burdenand where their presence is sometimes positivelydisruptive. The loss of the replacement places wouldmean that some 1,500 children and their teachershad to spend another year in unsatisfactory ac-commodation.SCHOOL MILK16. The expenditure tables assume that for 1975-76and subsequently a recommendation of the Com-mittee on Catering Arrangements in Schools will beadopted. School milk would continue to be pro-vided free of charge to children aged 7-11 on grounds of health or if they were attending a specialSchool but in other cases authorities would beallowed to sell milk on the same footing as the saleof refreshments and beverages other than a schooldinner, i.e. provision and prices would be at the discretion of the authority instead of their having to charge the full cost as at present. The net additionalaverage annual cost is estimated at  1-2 million ayear.SCHOOL MEALS17. The assumptions underlying Cmnd. 5519 havebeen retained, viz. that the price of a school dinnerwill be increased from 12p to 13p on 1st January1975, to 15p on 1st September 1975, and by lp and2p alternatively on each 1st September thereafter.NON-ADVANCED FURTHER EDUCATION18. It is assumed that the building programme for1975-76 will be reduced to half the Cmnd. 5519revalued level, that reductions will be made in later years, and that some redundant colleges ofeducation places will become available for non-advanced further education. The result of these measures would probably be a decline in the standards of accommodation rather than a fall instudent numbers, since this is a sector wheredemand continues to be strong and where localauthorities have traditionally met it.19. Although thej matter has yet to be consideredby Ministers collectively, provision has been madein both capital arid recurrent expenditure for thedevelopment of adult education on the lines recom-mended in the Russell Report, which has important implications for dealing with adult illiteracy.HIGHER/1 EDUCATION20. The building programmes originally envisaged in Cmnd. 5519 were related to a target of 750,000places for full-time and, sandwich course students in higher education by 1981-82. Later projections oflikely demand from qualified school leavers would now suggest a revision of this target to 700,000.21. This change would imply some reduction in thevolume of future building programmes for higher education. But the drastic scale of reduction nowassumed (see table in paragraph 7), taken togetherwith the reduction already made in the unstartedbalance of the 1973-74 programme and the 1974-75programme by the December 1973 measures, gomuch further. In particular starts in 1975-76 wouldbe only about one-third of those envisaged in Cmnd.5519 revalued (i.e.  56 million compared with 153 million) and those in 1976-77 about one-half(i.e.  84 million compared with  173 million). Inconsequence, the total number of places likely to beavailable in 1981-82, some 680,000, would fall short of the revised lower target by 20,000. More impor-tant, on present projections of demand, in the late1970s and early 1980s it might be necessary to restrict the number of qualified school leaversadmitted to higher education by up to 10,000 eachyear, compared with the number of applicants.22. The recurrent expenditure projections reflect the assumed pattern of increase in student numberstowards the target of 680,000. The view was expressed in Cmnd. 5174 that student /staff ratios in higher education should be modified by the end ofthe decade to an average level of about 10:1. the quinquennial settlement of university recurrent grant for the period 1972-77 took account/of this view andthe projections of expenditure now made maintainthe movement towards the target of 10:1. Asregards local authority current expenditure on higher education, the projections retain annualreductions in expenditure to reflect the tightening of staffing standards which local authorities were urged to promote in polytechnics and other colleges inDOE Circular 19/74 (DES Circular 2/74). How-ever, this movement towards less generous staff/student ratios was originally envisaged as occurring
during a period of steady expansion towards the target of 750,000 places by 1981-82. But a lower level of student numbers might make it more difficultto achieve the desired ratio.UNIVERSITY AND FURTHER EDUCATION FEES23. The projections assume an increase in thesefees from 1st September 1975 instead of 1st Septem-ber 1974. Since the proposed increase was large inpercentage terms the question - of its scale and timing needed consideration in the context of pay and prices policy, a process which was interrupted by the recent election. The consequent delay meant that for practical reasons alone the increase has hadto be deferred for a year.BRITISH LIBRARY24. The figures for the Survey period assume thatthe Bloomsbury site will continue to be used for thedevelopment of the Library. An alternative site isnow being considered. The cost of acquisitionwould be covered within the overall figures pro-vided the Bloomsbury site was sold, though expendi-ture in any individual year might differ somewhatfrom the figures in Table 10 because the timing of purchases and disposals would be unlikely tosynchronise exactly. Construction of the Library on either site is assumed to fall outside the survey period. The extent of any saving in the final costof the Library due to the change of site is beingexplored.LOCAL AUTHORITY LIBRARIESCapital expenditure25. This is dealt with as locally determined sectorcapital which is managed by DoE. A reduction of 1 million in each year (equivalent to about 10 percent) has been assumed.Recurrent expenditure26. A 2 per cent growth rate from the 1974-75level of expenditure has been assumed comparedwith about 5 per cent assumed for Cmnd. 5519.SCOTLAND (excluding University Grants Com-mittee expenditure on universities)27. The amounts available for expenditure in eachyear, excluding grants to persons and North Seaoil infrastructure expenditure (see Special Analysis7), are:  million1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79389-2	398-9	406-4	416-228. The expenditure projections in the sub-programmes are based on the following forecasts of the numbers of pupils, students and teachers:Thousands	1974.	1975	1976	1977 ^	197S	-75	-76	-77 7.	-78	-79Schools:					Under fives     1 .	18	\ 28	35	42	50Other primary	615	603	591	573	555Secondary .	398	405	412	416	416Teachers (excluding nursery)	52	53	53	53	53Further Education:					Students	69	72	75	78	81Colleges of Education:					Students    .      .      .	15	16	16	15	1529.

The programme will enable a start to be madeon new building for under-fives from October 1974,at a somewhat lower rate of progress than that envisaged in Cmnd. 5175 (Education in Scotland: aStatement of Policy: December 1972). The numberof places provided by 1977 will be about 27,000compared with the 35,000 planned in Cmnd. 5175.The proportion of the three and four-year-oldpopulation in nursery education will be about 37per cent instead of 40 per cent, the reduction being less than might have been expected because of changes in the population forecast. IRecurrent expenditure31. The projected expenditure matches the increasein numbers expected under the revised capital programme but the standard of service will haveto be reduced below that envisaged in Cmnd. 5175.PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND SPECIAL SCHOOLSCapital expenditure32. The programme will meet the basic need for additional school places throughout the period ata cost of some delay and disruption of the 1974-75
programme already settled. In 1974-75 and 1975-76it will not be possible to continue the programmeannounced in Cmnd. 5175 for additional accom-modation to cope with improved primary schoolstaffing standards, for replacement or improvementof old primary schools or for secondary schoolimprovements and replacements scheduled for1975-76; but this programme will be resumed from1976-77 at about half the rate foreseen in Cmnd.5175. The Cmnd. 5175 programme for special schools will be interrupted in the two years 1974-75and 1975-76 but will be resumed from 1976-77onwards.Recurrent expenditure33. The growth rate in expenditure is sufficient topermit the pupil/teacher ratios planned for 1975-76to be met either then or in the following year, butthere is likely to be a marked decline below whatwas envisaged in Cmnd. 5175 in the scale ofimprovement on the non-teaching side even afterre-allocating some expenditure originally earmarked for the under-fives. In particular, authorities willbe unable to recruit auxiliaries or to improveeducational equipment on the scale expected and,given the increase in maintenance costs which willbe generated by the heavy capital programmes ofrecent years, they may find difficulty in undertakingnecessary maintenance.SCHOOL MILK AND MEALS34. The expenditure projection&apos;; assume no changein the Cmnd. 5519 policies on school milk and school meals. For school meals this implies that expenditure will be based on the assumption that price of the meal will be raised by lp in January1975, by 2p at the start of school session 1975-76,and by amounts of lp and 2p alternately at the start of succeeding sessions.NON-ADVANCED FURTHER EDUCATIONCapital expenditure35. The programme provides for a net increase of1,700 in the number of places for non-advancedFE students. There may be a shortage of accom-modation in certain areas, leading to the continueduse of sub-standard facilities.Recurrent expenditure36. Demand for further education is likely to goon rising. The projected expenditure will enablethe existing standard of the. service to be main-tained but there will be little room for any improvement.HIGHER EDUCATIONCapital expenditure37. The programme provides for starts of  11-7 million in 1975-76, rising to about  13-2 million in 1978-79.  Starts for several projects would be delayed beyond 1975-76. The number of placesavailable by 1981 would probably be in the 39,000-41,000 range. That would fall short of the 43,000places planned in Cmnd. 5175, but would probablymeet the demand from qualified school leavers for higher education.Recurrent expenditure38. The projected expenditure reflects the increaseof student numbers foreseen above, but it will be insufficient to secure the improvement in standardsenvisaged in Cmnd. 5175.SOCIAL AND RECREATIONAL EDUCATIONCapital expenditure39. The projected expenditure should allow forthe maintenance of existing standards, but not forany improvement in deprived areas nor for theprovision of facilities in new housing areas.LOCAL AUTHORITY LIBRARIESCapital expenditure40. The programme will allow for the start of twoor three major projects of high priority but some75 projects will have to be postponed until 1977-78and after.Recurrent expenditure41. The projected expenditure is likely to involve some reduction in existing standards.Research Councils, etc.42. This is a block budget (the &quot; Science Budget&quot;)and is allocated by the Secretary of State for education and Science, on advice received from thethe Advisory Board for the Research Councils, tothe five Research Councils (Agricultural, Medical,Natural Environment, Science and Social Science),to the British Museum (Natural History), and to agrant-in-aid to the Royal Society for scientific pur-poses. The allocation for 1974-75 is broken downas follows:  million1974-75//-&apos;Agricultural Research Council    ..      . . 15-1Medical Research Council..... 26-1Natural Environment Research Council      . . 16-1Science Research Council  .     .     .     . . 83-5Social Science Research Council .      .      . .          6-8Natural History Museum* .      .      .      . .         2-6Royal Society...... .          1-5Total    .......       151-7* Includes provision for major building.
43. The purpose of the research financed fromthe Science Budget is to develop the sciences assuch, to maintain a fundamental capacity for research and to support higher education. It covers a wide spectrum of activity, ranging from investiga-tion of human and animal health and behaviourthrough the causes of, and cures, for pollution, tothe mapping of the earth, sea and sky and the investigation of the laws of physical matter.Research Councils support these activities partly by carrying out research in their own establish-ments and units, partly by making grants touniversity departments, providing central facilitiesfor university research workers, and providingsupport grants for postgraduate students.44. The figures for 1974-75 and 1975-76 in Table10 reflect the decision, announced in the 1972 white paper &quot;Framework for Government R and D&quot;(Cmnd. 5046) to transfer certain sums phased over three years starting in 1973-74, from the science budget to customer departments for the purposeof commissioning applied research. 1975-76 is thelast year of this transition period.45. The 1975-76 figure for the Science Budgetas calculated represents a cut of  9-3 million onthe level implied by Cmnd. 5519 revalued.Assuming that reductions fall to be made on thesame basis by customer departments in theirtransferred funds, the total reduction in research council expectations for that year would be some 13 million. This would be 1 per cent less in real terms than the total for 1974-75 which was itself,as a result of the December cuts, some 2-5 percent less in real terms than the figure for 1973-74.The table provides for growth to be resumed in1976-77 and each following year at 2-2 per cent(the rate provided for in Cmnd. 5519) but thesereal reductions in two successive years mean thatthe level of total funding of the Research Councils(assuming that customer departments allow the transferred funds to increase at the same rate asthe Science Budget) would barely regain the1973-74 level by 1977-78.46. This slow rate of growth must have its effecton the basic scientific capability of the research councils and on the university research and train-ing which they support. Particularly serious wouldbe the effects of the negative growth on the first two years of the Survey period at a time whenbecause of pressure on the universities&apos; own resources Research Council funding has becomeeven more important to university research. Sincemuch of the work of the Research Councils,whether carried out in their own establishments orsupported by means of university grants, is longterm, a high proportion of their annual expenditure is committed in advance. The Research Councilshave had to concentrate on ongoing work and to defer new projects and initiatives in 1974-75 inorder to absorb the December cuts. Negativegrowth over two years would involve furtherdeferring capital expenditure and reducing expendi-ture on new lines of research and on new researchgrants for work of timeliness and promise. the council&apos;s would thus have a much-reduced capacity for responding to new research needs, both basic and applied, over the next two years.Arts47.  The figures relevant to this programme are:  million	1975	1976	1977    197S	-76	-77	-78     -79Provision for central govern-			ment expenditure included			, in Table 10   .	43-4	44-5	47-1 ,[49-4]Growth rate on previous			year percentage	+3-1	4-2-5	+5-8I+4-9]Within these limits it is necessary to provideextra resources to operate the new National Theatre,to. develop arts activities in the regions (the specialregional supplement ends in 1974-75), and to findresources for the introduction of a public lendingright scheme by 1977-78. The planned growtlrequired for these items, together with a modestexpansion of other Arts Council activities and in expenditure on the art of the film, will still enablean average annual increase in real terms of about per cent for the Arts Council and the British FilmInstitute, but this will be well below the annual increase in real terms of 10 per cent on which their recent expectations have been based.48. To maintain this lower rate of growth in arts council expenditure it would be necessary to holdnational museum and gallery activity broadly at itspresent level, apart from those additions required bythe need to man extensions at those institutionsscheduled for completion during the period. Thenational museum and gallery building programme will require further review and rephasing. This re-phasing will inevitably include schemes announced by the previous Government, given the need to accommodate these expenditures %ithin the abovetotals for the arts programme.49. No additional provision has been included forcompleting the National Theatre building, or fo:increasing the annual purchase grants-in-aid to tienational museums and galleries when the presentquinquennium expires in 1974-75. In both casesexisting provisions are in cash terms and thequestion of revaluation will require further study &quot;toestablish the future limits of the arts programme.

As with local libraries capital expenditure inEngland and Wales falls to be dealt with as locally determined sector capital, and for recurrent expendiTture the same assumptions have been made as for local libraries a 2 per cent growth rate from1974-75.(51. In Scotland provision has been included from1974-75 within these figures for the Ope^a Houseelement of the Castle Terrace Theatre development in Edinburgh. Estimates of cost have been escalat-ing rapidly, and no decision has been taken either by the Government or by the Corporation on apossible starting date.

The coverage of the programme is, broadly speaking, unchanged. The only significant change incontent is the inclusion of expenditure on schoolhealth services (previously on the education pro-gramme) which, with &quot; local health services &quot; for-merly administered by local authorities, is recorded under the heading &quot;Hospitals and com-munity health services&quot;, run by the new area health authorities. The programme also providesfor the cost of remission of dental and ophthalmiccharges on income grounds, previously borne by thesocial security programme. The coverage changesadd about  50 million to the programme in 1974-75rising to about  55 million in 1977-78.2.  Announced policy changes include:1. The reductions announced on 17th December1973.2. The abolition of prescription charges for children between the ages of 15 and 16 andfor women between 60 and 65 years of age.The estimated cost is  3-0 million in 1974-75rising to  3-2 million in 1978-79.3. No prescription charges for family planning,   supplies.    The   estimated   cost   will   be 1 -4 million in 1974-75 rising to  3-5 million a year when the service is fully developed.3. The forecasts for 1975-76 onwards have been calculated in accordance with the instructions for theconduct of this year&apos;s Survey. The growth rates, in real terms, on the previous year are as follows:	England	Wales (Per cent)	Scotland1974-75   .	&apos; -	1-5	1-01975-76   .	3-0	3-2	311976-77   .	3-1	3-1	3-31977-78   .	3-2	3-2	3-71978-79   .	3-2	3-2	3-6General4. The allocations from 1974-75 onwards aregenerally as low as can be tolerated without seriousdisruption of services. Many services are already under severe pressure, and as the years pass theywill have to cope with an increasing and ageingpopulation. In the difficult allocation of resourcesbetween capital and current, there has on the onehand been the realisation that capital reductionshave already dimmed the expectations of the recentpast and on the other hand that services are sufter-ing because of the difficulty of obtaining staff.Within the narrow range of choice for improvementgiven by the reduced allocations, the present policyis to concentrate relatively more on improved staff-ing for the services than on building.
HealthHOSPITALS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICESCapital expenditure . The programme is controlled as a block budget and, following NHS reorganisation, covers health centres, the requirements of the ambulance serviceand the small amount of capital expenditure onthe school health service, as well as hospitals. Thehospital programme has always been a mixture ofsmall and very large schemes; the new programmeadds to these characteristics and can be described as containing a mixture of the very small and thevery large, the simple and the complex and the short-term and the long-term.6. From the early 1960s up to 1973-74 the sharplyrising investment gave the programme an impetuswhich will carry it forward for the next few years.Despite the reduced allocation for 1974-75, it will bepossible to start 93 major schemes in that year,making available by 1980 over 9,300 new hospitalbeds and over 2,000 new day places, the beds beingshared roughly half to acute services and half to the elderly, mentally ill, mentally handicapped and maternity services.   ,7. This impetus, and the commitments arisingfrom it, cannot be fully maintained with the reducedallocations for the future years. It has beendecided that projects contractually committed now,or due to start in 1974-75, will not be stopped;that the health centre programme should continue torise, because of the importance attached to health centre policy; that in view of present uncertaintiesnew work should be concentrated on the smallerschemes; and that consequently there will be very few major scheme starts in 1975-76 and 1976-77.Thereafter, it will be possible to embark again on major schemes, subject to rigid control of their number.Current expenditure. This programme, controlled as a block budget,covers advances to the new health authorities forrunning the services. Between 1970-71 and1973-74, expenditure on them increased in real terms by an average of just over 4 per cent a year.For the hospital services, this represented a basic rate of growth of 3  per cent augmented by addi-tional funds for the mentally ill, the mentally handi-capped and the elderly. The planned rate of growthbetween 1973-74 and 1974-75 (and for subsequent years) for the combined services was nearly 3  percent. This was reduced to just over 2 per cent inthe first year by the effect of the December 1973reductions. The rates of growth now proposed are2f per cent between 1974-75 and 1975-76, and about per cent a year up to 1978-79.9. The money available for current expenditure ofhealth authorities needs to increase at not lessthan some 1^-2 per cent in a year in real terms to maintain the standard of service existing at thebeginning of the year. Two factors, partly inter-acting, account for this. An increase of about\-l per cent is needed, to meet the requirements ofthe growing and ageing population; and increases in staff and continuing developments of servicesintroduced in the course of the previous year, willrequire additional money to finance them for thewhole of the ensuing year. Any balance of thereal terms addition to funds over and above the1^-2 per cent will enable health authorities as awhole to develop further their services in waysdetermined by national and local priorities; andsavings in the cost of existing services throughimprovements in efficiency, through rationalisation,or through the closure of hospitals no longer re-quired (often following the provision of newhospitals) will increase the money available fordevelopments of choice.10. A further constraint on the use of the funds available to health authorities is: that the commis-sioning of a new, extended or rebuilt hospital orother premises provided for the capital programmenormally involves additional revenue expenditure the revenue consequences of capital schemes(RCCS). This is because new buildings are usuallyprovided in areas where there is an insufficiencyof capital stock to meet the existing or growing demand, or where improvements or developments of modern treatment cannot be provided in the oldbuildings. To some extent the additional RCCScosts represent ways of meeting the additional demands noted in paragraph 9 above; to an extent they represent developments of choice partlychoices taken some years ago when the building of a new hospital started, partly current choicesin deciding to use a small amount of capital to ,improve or extend part of a building.11. A growth rate of 2\ per cent in 1975-76followed by 3 per cent a year would not lead toa general lowering of standards; it would clearlylimit severely the scope for development, although this would be mitigated to the extent that any fundscould be saved by the closure of surplus hospitals and by other economies. Because the distributionof available funds betweerr health authorities mustbe to some extent differential, to meet pressinglocal needs in some places, it may be necessarysomewhat to reduce standards or levels of provision in some other places. Items likely to be particularly affected are the proposals for improvements in acutespecialist services and in the clinical support and domestic services for hospitals in general.FAMILY PRACTITIONER SERVICES12. This heading covers the general medical, dentaland ophthalmic services, and the pharmaceuticalservices. The forecasts are the best availableestimates of expenditure, based on the numbers of
practitioners expected to participate in the servicesand the number and cost of services, treatments andprescriptions. They assume that prescription charges will remain at the flat rate of 20p an itemfor most items and that existing exemptions willbe increased to include children aged 15 and womenaged 60-64; that dental and ophthalmic charges willbe increased as costs rise; and that family planningsupplies will be prescribed and dispensed free of charge. The Social Services Secretary howeverholds strongly to the view that the charges forlenses and frames should not rise as their costrises, and the Treasury have noted that policy onophthalmic charges will require further discussion.An allowance has been made for the participation of general practitioners in the expanded family planning service on the terms recommended by the doctors and Dentists Review Body.Personal Social ServicesLOCAL AUTHORITY CAPITAL EXPENDITURE13. It is proposed that expenditure from 1975-76onwards should remain at the level of 1974-75,which was reduced substantially following measures taken by the previous Government. These forecastswill still permit a sizeable programme of additionaland replacement premises, adaptations and improve-ments to homes for the elderly, mentally handi-capped and children in care and to day and train-ing centres. But at this reduced level of expendi-ture, following the rapid rise up to 1973-74,progress towards the targets set before the localauthorities for their Ten-Year Plans (England andWales), and achievement of the aim of shifting thebalance of care from hospitals to the community,will inevitably be delayed.LOCAL AUTHORITY CURRENT EXPENDITURE14. Current expenditure on the personal social services has been one of the fastest-growing sectorsin the local authority field of responsibility. Theaverage annual growth (excluding concessionaryfares) between 1971-72 and 1974-75 is likely tobe over 9 per cent. Because growth up to 1973-74substantially exceeded the forecasts, Cmnd. 5519provided for a smaller growth rate up to 1977-78,in order to produce an average rate between1972-73 and 1977-78 of about 7 per cent a year.15. The Table now provides for an average growth(excluding concessionary fares) of about 6 per cent a year between 1975-76 and 1978-79. The first charge on the increase in current expenditure isthe revenue consequences of capital schemes and inview of the constraint on current expenditure a capital programme of about  80 million a year is,despite the consequences noted in paragraph 13,probably the highest that ought to be contemplated.Revenue consequences arising from a capital pro-gramme of  80 million a year are likely to be ofthe order of  10-12 million, thus leaving only  19million (about 4 per cent) available for otherdevelopments. Particularly important is the needv to increase the field and domiciliary services;improvement in the standard of staffing in homes and day centres for the elderly, and for thephysically and mentally handicapped, is another important aim. The reduced forecasts will meanslower progress in all respects.CONCESSIONARY FARES16. This item is at present included in the current expenditure of local authority Personal social services. It was formerly part of what is now&quot;Other Environmental Services&quot;. Expenditure isrising steeply. The forecast for 1974-75 is, in real terms, over five times the expenditure of 1969-70,and by 1978-79 expenditure is likely to have risen by another 50 per cent.17. The question of the correct classification ofthis expenditure, and of whether it should be theresponsibility of the Secretary of State for the social services or the Secretary of State for the Environ-ment is at present under discussion between theMinisters concerned.Nurse training18. Ministers wish to prepare for the introduction in 1978-79 of the nurse training arrangementsrecommended by the Briggs Committee. The maincost of the scheme will fall to hospitals and com-munity health services current expenditure, throughthe employment of additional staff, and will be metwithin the control allocations. But it will benecessary to train more tutors and teachers before-hand and provision has been made for the allocations to the General Nursing Councils to beincreased for this purpose by  1-0 million in1975-76, rising to  2 0 million in 1978-79.Manpower19. The. manpower forecasts for the programme are broadly in line with the expenditure forecasts,Total manpower is planned to rise from 1,046,670at the beginning of 1974-75 to 1,205,140 at the endof 1978-79. Over these six years the increase willbe about 15-1 per cent out there are expected tobe widely varying rates of growth within thedifferent parts of the service. Manpower in thelocal authority personal social services is forecast to grow by about 31 per cent compared with 11-8per cent in the combined hospitals and community health services bloc continuing the present trendand reflecting the higher rate of expenditure growthfor the personal social services within the reducedallocations. The growth in numbers of general medical and dental practitioners is expected to beabout 7-5 per cent, a rate of increase which is considerably higher than the forecast growth in population over the period (about 2 per cent).

Upratings1. It has been decided that the 1974 uprating willtake effect on 22nd July and that the long-term benefits will be increased by 29 per cent and the short-term benefits by 17 per cent. On presentassumptions about the movement of prices the realimprovement will be 13*2 per cent and 2-6 percent respectively over the benefit rates established in October 1973.2. For upratings from 1975 onwards it has been assumed that the long-term benefits will beincreased in line with earnings and that the short-term benefits will be increased in line with pricesplus a small safety margin (1  per cent). Thedate of the 1975 uprating is assumed to be 28thJuly 1975, which is the latest date permitted underthe National Insurance Act 1974. That Act alsorepealed the requirement for subsequent upratingsto take place in the second half of November eachyear, but it did not substitute another date, leaving the question open. The programme has therefore been costed on the basis of the pattern laid down before the repeal, namely that upratings from 1976onwards will take effect on 16th November.3. The cost of the real improvement in benefits,with upratings as described above, is:  million at 1974 Survey prices1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79411	648	709o	848&apos;	983National Superannuation4. It is envisaged that a national superannuationscheme, to replace the present national insurancescheme, will be ready for introduction in April1978, but in advance of decisions on the content ofthe scheme, the present forecasts are based on the continuation of the present scheme.Lump-sum payments to pensioners5. No provision is made for further repetition ofa  10 lump sum paid to pensioners in December1972 and November 1973. .Supplementary benefit6. It has been assumed that, following recentpractice, the supplementary benefit scale rates willbe increased at each uprating by the same cashamount as the corresponding national insurancerates. An allowance has been made for estimatedfuture increases in the rents of people receivingsupplementary benefit. It is assumed that theamounts of income disregarded in assessing title to benefit, last increased in 1966, will remain fixed in money terms throughout the period of the Survey.Family endowment7. Family allowances have been costed on theusual assumption that they will remain the same in cash terms. Ministers have a commitment todevelop them into a new system of child cashallowances, including an allowance for the first or only child in the family, who does not qualify fora family allowance at present. But no decisions have yet been taken on the amount and timing ofthese new allowances.8. For this reason the forecast of expenditure on family income supplement has not been reduced totake account of the effect of the new child cashallowances, and it is therefore assumed to remain at a fixed level in real terms throughout the periodof the Survey.Short-term benefits9. No change has been assumed in the structure of the short-term benefits, pending Ministers&apos;decisions on the outcome of the review of thissubject. It has been assumed that earnings-relatedsupplement will be payable at the 15 per cent rate on earnings between  30 and whatever upper limit is set for the payment of earnings-related contribu-tions. This limit was  54 in April 1974, will be 69 in April 1975, and is assumed to be raised in line with the movement of earnings each Aprilthereafter.Death grant and maternity grant10.  Death grant and maternity grant are assumed to remain fixed in money terms throughout theperiod of the Survey.Financing of the Social Security Programme11. The expenditure on benefits from the national insurance Fund and the income from contributions and Treasury supplement are estimated as follows.The contribution rates assumed to apply in 1975-76and later years are those proposed in the currentSocial Security (Amendment) Bill.  million at 1974 Survey prices1974 1975 1976 1977 1978-75 -76 -77 -78   -79National Insurance Fund:?Benefit expenditure     .    5,079 5,359 5,424 5,715 5,912Contributions from in-sured persons and employers . . 4,771 4,639 5,011 5,171 5,307Treasury supplement .     836    835    902    931   955Total5,607 5,474 5,913 6,102 6,262The cost of the non-contributory benefits, which ismet out of the Consolidated Fund, is as follows:  million at 1974 Survey prices1974-75     1975-76     1976-77     1977-78     1978-791,4271,4161,3571,3401,317

In the case of the Inland Revenue and customs and Excise it is not possible to make any cutsbased on &quot;expenditure other than wages and salaries &quot;. This is because this expenditure is notonly comparatively small and thus offers onlyminimal scope for savings but also because itconsists almost entirely of Post Office charges and staff-related costs such as travelling expenses. in successive public expenditure exercises it has beenaccepted that cuts in such small items are not desirable since they would be likely to result in an actual reduction in the amount of tax and dutycollected. The estimates also allow for an increasein staff to deal with the additional work resultingfrom the 1974 Budget commitments.2. In the case of the driver and vehicle licensingdirectorate (DVLD) at Swansea increased man-power requirements during the transitional period will entail additional expenditure, but numbers areexpected to decrease thereafter until the situation isovertaken by the rising demographic trend. Pay-ments made to local authorities for operating thepresent service are due to cease in 1977-78.OTHER FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION3. The figures in Table 13 for the Departmentof National Sayings (DNS) have to take account ofthe additional costs arising from the Chancellorssavings package announced on 26th March 1974.Nevertheless DNS can continue to provide theexisting range of National Savings services (a) byabolition of the National Savings Stamp and the voluntary Movement; or failing that (6) by reduc-ing traffic and managiment costs by increasing theminimum purchase of National Savings Certificatesand Premium Savings Bonds, and by increasingthe minimum Premium Bond prize to  50; and (c)as necessary, by paring publicity.Central management of the Civil service. Expenditure in this programme includes thegeneral management functions of the Civil service department (CSD), central civil service recruitment,central civil service training, and other centralservices for civil service management, Royal Com-missions, etc., Office of the Parliamentary Counseland the Government Hospitality Fund. Theresources included in Table 13 will, after making allfeasible economies, enable the departmental policies to be carried out with the exception of additional
commitments incurred for assistance for certain civilservice welfare organisations and a higher rate ofexpenditure on Government hospitality in 1977-78.Records, Registrations and Surveys5. This includes expenditure by several Govern-ment Departments (the Office of Population Cen-suses and Surveys, General Register Office (Scot-land), Land Registry, Ordnance Survey and minorexpenditure in other Departments) and a smalleramount of local authority expenditure. The expendi-ture on Social Surveys, carried out on an alliedservice basis, for Government Departments is included. Part of the decrease in expenditure after1971-72 results from the completion of the 1971Census.6. An early decision is required on a 1976 census of Population which would provide information on major changes since 1971 both for Central Govern-ment and for local authorities. No provision forthe cost has been included in the Survey. This isestimated to be  21 million, spread as follows:  million	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78England and Wales	0-9	2-1	12-6	1-scotland	0-2	0-4	2-4	0-5	1-1	2-5	15-0	2-4The total cost might rise		to  23	million	if new techniques for speedier publications were applied.7. The Land Registry&apos;s forecast income from ad valorem fees shows a decrease of  3-4 million ayear compared with Cmnd. 5519 revalued. Thisreflects, the continued slowing down in the increasein house prices as well as a general decrease inactivity in the property market.Broadcasting (Capital Expenditure)8. Expenditure covers the capital requirementsof the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)Home Services and the Independent broadcasting authority (IBA). These bodies are co-ordinatingseparately financed programmes for the construc-tion of 625-line UHF (Ultra-High Frequency) sta-tions to transmit all BBC and IBA television ser-vices, ultimately replacing VHF (Very-High Fre-quency) stations which do not transmit colour orBBC 2 programmes. It was planned to achieve99 per cent coverage from the UHF stations by 1980but the level of provision in the table will delaythis by some two years and will deprive some peopleof television in the remoter areas because spare parts for their obsolete 405-line VHF sets will nolonger be obtainable. The BBCs expenditure (capi-tal and current) is financed by Government grantwhich at present consists of the whole of the netlicence revenue. The IBA provides transmitters to broadcast the programmes of independent television and independent local radio companies and is fin-anced by the rentals charged to the companies. TheIndependent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973 also provides for the IBA to draw up to  2 million on loan for financing the independent local radioservices.Other services9. The largest single item in this programme isthe capital investment programme of Cable and wireless Ltd amounting to  100 million for the fiveyears to 1978-79, most of which is abroad. Thecompany, whose shares are wholly owned by theGovernment, is run as a commercial enterprise andits investment is financed from profits and borrow-ing other than from the Government. Its principalactivity is the provision of international communi-cations and internal telephone systems in a numbeiof countries, and it is an important link in the Com-commonwealth telecommunications network. because in the long-term countries are likely to take oveithe running of their own systems, it has recentlybeen agreed that the company should expand thediversification of its business into related telecommunications-munications activities. Account is taken of the ex-expansion but at this stage the rate is uncertain.82CONFD)ENTlAl

This programme includes all expenditure onthe provision of office buildings, and on thefurnishing and running costs of office buildings andspecialised buildings. Capital expenditure relatesmainly to the building and furnishing of new office buildings and covers programmes for local offices and headquarters buildings in London and the regions. No allowance is made for extra require-ments that may arise if new policies are adoptedrequiring more staff.2. Within the programme for new works, whichis had to bear the main burden of recent public expenditure cuts, schemes related to Departments&apos;operational needs (e.g. computer centres) and other essential work like occupational services will con-tinue much as planned and account for a large partof the expenditure up to 1975-76. In that year,there is a provision of about  11 million for startingmajor new headquarters and local office schemes and site purchases; this is about 60 per cent belowthe previously planned level. This means that itwill not be possible to start more than one or twoof the five major London schemes (Vauxhall, Ele-phant &amp; Castle, Royal Mint site, Whitehall redevel-opment and Horseferry Road); the others will haveto be deferred by two years or so. Over the period as a whole about  7 million a year will be madeavailable on average for the local office building programme (about 40 per cent below the previouslyplanned level). The choice of which schemes toproceed with will need to be considered with theCivil Service Department and the Departments con-. cerned. It is, however, ;4already clear that none ofthe major London schemes can be ready for useuntil the 1980s. The implications of this pro-gramme for the rent bill are serious: the rent billis now largely governed by the need to lease space in London. No provision has been made for build-ing for any new dispersal programme.,3. Provision of  3  million a year has been re-/fallocated to a special programme of improvements&quot; to working conditions in the poorer quality govern-ment offices.   The Civil Service Department have pressed for a higher (and rising) level of expenditureon this item.4. Reduced design needs for new buildings should result in reduced expenditure on departmental ad-ministration (mainly payments to consultants). Sofar as furniture is concerned, reduced requirements to furnish new works schemes have not significantly
affected the provision in the Survey period since alarge part of forecast expenditure is committed to new works already in progress, new rented accom-modation and replacements. Maintenance and run-toing costs will be only slightly reduced: there is little scope for further reductions apart from the continuing search for greater efficiency and economyparticularly in view of the increasing size of the estate.5. There will be no cuts in the rent bill. The rentforecasts assume that apart from demands to be met in 1974-75 the office estate will have to be expanded to house another 17,500 staff by 1978 i.e. by about\ million sq ft: they allow for Crown buildings tobe completed in the provinces during this period.Stationery and printing (home)6. Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office supplies Govern-ment Departments with their printing, stationery andoffice machinery, and is responsible for the printing and in most cases the publication, distribution and sale of Government publications.7. The level of provision in the table will permitHMSO to maintain a reasonable level of service pro-vided that departments are able to restrict demands.Normal replacement programmes for officemachinery will continue but there is likely to be some reduction in projects for further mechanisationand consequently some loss of potential staff savings in customer departments.Computers and telecommunications8. The role of the Central Computer Agency is topromote the application of computer systems inGovernment with the aim of improving efficiency and widening policy choices. It gives advice on systems and equipment, and on project andinstallation management and it provides centralisedpurchasing and contractual services. The Agencyis also responsible for policy and financial controlof telecommunications used in Government for adminsitrative purposes. It manages the WhitehallCBX and Federal telephone networks and is settingup studies on rationalising and increasing theefficiency of communications in Government.9. With the programme shown in Table 14,resources would be available in the telecommunications-tions field only for the essential replacement of theFederal exchange.10. As for computers, the adequacy of the figuresfor 1976-77 and thereafter may depend on theresults of other Departmental reviews. Subject tothat, to keep within the funds available in the latter part of the period, it would be necessary to startrestricting, during the current year, in some way thenumbers or scale of ongoing or approved schemes.The choice of which schemes to proceed with would need to be considered with the Departments con-cerned.11. Alternatively it Would be possible to proceedwith all these systems if the present policy of pur-chasing Government computer equipment wasaltered so that in some cases the less economiccourse of hiring was adopted. This would inevitably lead to increased expenditure in the long run.Home publicity12. This covers expenditure on publicity campaignswhich are carried out by the Central Office of Infer-mation and Scottish Office for other GovernmentDepartments and includes the related printing costson Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office Vote. Pub-publicity is directed principally at audiences in theUnited Kingdom through the media of Press and television advertising, films, exhibitions and publica-tions in support of departmental policies. The sumswill provide for Government publicity to assistrecruitment (mainly to the Armed Forces), to en-courage changes in social behaviour, for exampletowards road safety, and to inform the public of available social and other benefits; but effectiveness of such campaigns will be limited by the restriction on funds for this programme. The manpowerimplications for the Central Office of information will not become clear until details of the campaignsare known.&quot;: -    : - &apos; &apos;Civil superannuation13. The main extra costs expected to arise fromthe introduction in June 1972 of a new civil service pension scheme were taken into account in earlierforecasts. Experience with the working of the new scheme suggests, however, that there will be alarger increase than originally expected in the num-ber of new superannuation awards and in the size of individual awards, off-set to some extent by higherreceipts from periodical contributions for widows&apos;benefits, etc. The present forecasts take account ofthese factors.14. The forecasts ^rhake provision for the once-for-all expenditure in 1975-76 of  30 million in respectof the cost of transferring to the Civil aviation authority the accrued pension rights of some 7,500civil servants, at present seconded to that organisa-tion, who are expected to be transferred to theAuthority in that year. This payment is classified as public expenditure but does not represent a claim on resources until the pensions in question come tobe paid. With the transfer of these staff the presentannual secondment contribution of some  4 0 mil-lion from the Authority will cease, producing a consequent increase in net costs of this orderthroughout the Survey period. The forecasts also take this increase into account.15. The Pensions (Increase) Act 1974 provides forspecial increases in the pensions of those retired civilservants whose pensionable pay (upon which pension
is based) has been adversely affected by the PayPolicy. The cost of these increases, about  1-2 mil-lion in 1974-75 and 1975-76 and rather smalleramounts in later years, are also taken into account in the forecasts.Other common servicesThis programme covers the cost of legal services,the Government Actuary, Civil Service Catering Ser-vices and Transport Services, e.g. the GovernmentCar Service and the Inter-Departmental DispatchService.The PSA transport services will be cut each year bybetween  0 - 2 million and  0 - 3 million. This willbe about a 5 per cent reduction overall and will involve some cuts in the frequency and availability of services.The planned policies of the Civil Service CateringOrganisation can be achieved within the resourcesallocated.

Recent events do not affect this; 1but they will necessarily delay the arrangements which were to have been introduced in line withparagraphs 86-89 of Cmnd. 5259 for giving NorthernIreland a high degree of freedom in the deployment of their resources over a wide field of expenditure.3. The table does not include the annual expendi-ture by the United Kingdom Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food and Department of Prices and consumer Protection (together amounting to about 48-5 million in 1974-75) in respect of NorthernIreland&apos;s share of the United Kingdom agricultural support payments and food subsidies. Most but not1. Part A of Table 15 covers expenditure on the transferred services as estimated by the NorthernIreland Departments. Part B covers expenditure,mainly in connection with Law, Order and Protec-tive Services, on matters for which responsibilityfalls to United Kingdom Departments.2. This arrangement reflects the transfer of ser-vices provided for in the Northern Ireland Constitu-tion Act 1973 which took effect on 1st January 1974.The total public sector demand which NorthernIreland makes on United Kingdom resources for all services in Parts A and B is settled within thearrangements for control of total United Kingdom
all of this expenditure is separately identified in theParliamentary Estimates for 1974-75 as Class XV, 1but in the present Survey all of it is included inTable 3 above.4. Table 15 also does not include the costs attribu-table to the Army&apos;s role in Northern Ireland, whichare included in Table 1.Changes in expenditure . Because of the special circumstances which pre-vail there, expenditure in Northern Ireland wasexempted from the reductions which were applied by the previous Government to most services inGreat Britain. Similarly the present forecasts for northern Ireland have been exempted from the for-mula reductions generally applied in the preparationof this Survey. The forecasts cover the revaluedcosts of the programmes incorporated in the 1973Survey, adjusted for estimating changes and forupward policy changes matching those in the restof the United Kingdom. (The Northern IrelandExecutive had intended to make representations tothe United Kingdom Government shortly aboutadditional expenditure to enable them to put intoeffect a Social and Economic Plan for improvements in conditions in Northern Ireland. The present fore-cast does not include provision for this.)6. The policy changes arise entirely in Part A.They result from the application to Northern Irelandof the policy increases approved for the rest of theUnited Kingdom in Agricultural Support (Beef Sub-sidy), Regional Employment Premiums, industrial training Board services, and Social services including Family Planning.7. Estimating changes arise in both Part A and part B. Those in Part A relate to the re-estimatingon a more realistic basis of the likely cost of servicestaken over during 1973 from the former localadministrations, including the public transport pro-gramme and certain personal health services, plussome changes in the Social Services figures in thelight of current economic assumptions. There aredownward adjustments in the likely up-take ofindustrial investment aid; these are in line with the shortfall in 1973-74. Changes on the Law andOrder services under Part B, however, account for a major part of the total net estimating additions.These increases arise because many of the services inquestion, administered by the Northern IrelandOffice, involve inevitably open-ended commitments.This is particularly true of the payment of com-pensation in respect of Criminal Damage to property and Criminal Injuries to Persons, and of the housingof prisoners and staffing of prisons. The forecast inrespect of these items in the 1973 Survey andthe forecast on police services assumed that politicalviolence in Northern Ireland would declinegradually. The hoped-for decline has not yetmaterialised.  This year&apos;s figures are based on theassumption of continuation of violence at the present level during the current year, declining thereafter.8. On compensation claims, continuing violenceresults in estimating additions of:  million1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-789-6 16-7 22-7 22-and the forecast of a total of  26-1 million inrespect of 1978-79.jl9. The present level of prison population and staff is almost double that on which the 1973 Surveyforecast for prisons was based and with continuingviolence is likely to remain at that level for someyears. This gives rise to estimating additions of:  million1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-784-4	3-3	3-8	3-and the forecast of a total of  6-8 million in1978-79.10. Continuing police overtime and /or improve-ment in police recruitment to deal with continuingviolence result in the following additions:  million1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-784-6	12-4	11-8	10-and the forecast of^a total of  35-6 million inrespect of 1978-79.Content of certain programmes under Part A11.

IIt Relevant expenditure for rate support grant includes loan charges and capital expenditure met from revenue; it excludes centralgovernment subsidies to housing revenue accounts.1. Local authority current expenditure in GreatBritain as summarised in the table above is forecast at about  5,800 million in 1974-75, rising to  6,900million in 1978-79. This represents some 16 to 17per cent of total public expenditure.2. The actual out turns for 1972-73 are based on local authority returns; the provisional out turns for1973-74 are Departments&apos; estimates.3. The public expenditure forecast for 1974-75 is broadly consistent with the relevant expenditure
figures for individual services accepted for thisyear&apos;s rate support grant. Responsibility for local health was transferred to other bodies on 1st April1974. In England and Wales water and sewerageservices were transferred to the Regional water authorities at the same time; relevant expenditure was extended to include general rate fund contri-butions to housing revenue accounts and trading services.4. The programmed rate of&quot; growth of localauthority current expenditure has been faster than for public expenditure as a whole. In 1973 itaccounted for 13-5 per cent of GNP, 4 per centmore than ten years previously. On top of this there has recently been a strong tendency for theactual growth to exceed the programmed growthby 3 to 4 per cent a year.5.

6. Local authority capital expenditure in GreatBritain as summarised in the table above isestimated at almost  2,700 million in 1974-75,or about 7-2 per cent of total public expenditure.7. In England and Wales a distinction is made between key sector services such as police, housing and school-building which are subject to specificDepartmental approval and the locally determinedpool within which local authorities are free to settheir own priorities. In the latter case the pattern of spending described in the analysis can be no more than a guide. In Scotland nearly all localcapital expenditure is subject to specific approval.8.

3.  Population and Employment (Great Britain)1. Changes in the population, either in total or inparticular age groups, affect a wide range of programmes. The latest projections available based on the mid-1972 estimate of population :are summarised in the following table.2. The changes from the projections made at thetime of the 1973 Survey are small and are mainly due to the fact that the estimates^ of births havebeen reduced over the first decade of the projection,the reduction falling to zero by 1981-82. This is reflected in the slower overall rate of increase. For1978 (the last year of the period covered in the1973 Survey) the projection for the 0-4 age grouphas been reduced by 369,000 (8-4 per cent);changes in the other groups are negligible.3. The size of the working population in 1973 is virtually the same as in last year&apos;s estimates butthe projected growth is slightly greater leading toan increase of 334,000 in the period up to 1978compared with an increase of 309,000 over thesame period in the previous projections. Thepresent estimates are based on trends in activityrates taken from censuses of population over theperiod 1951-1971.4- The projections shown are those available whenthe Survey was being conducted. Since then a newset of projections has been made, taking account ofrecent trends in births. The estimate of total popu-lation in 1978 has been reduced by half a million,and the number of children under five by rather more; the estimate for this age group is down bya further 13 per cent. The revision is, of course,larger and more widespread in later years.

5.  Government measures in support of prices policy a number of programmes include expendituredesigned to hold down the retail price level, e.g.by preventing higher costs from being passed onto consumers in full. The expenditure in questionis summarised in the table below with an indica-tion of the amounts involved. In some cases price control measures cannot be separated from expendi-ture which would have been incurred anyway andthe figures below must therefore be regarded asconjectural.  million at 1974 Survey pricesPrices policy measure and relevant Part 2 table1973-74    1974-75    1975-76    1976-77    1977-78    1978-79Table 3Food subsidies:Milk . .                   .      .      ... 103 260Bread . ...      .      ....   47Cheese . .     .      .     .      .     .     .      . - 30Butter ......... 17 53C1)Other .      .      ....... 5 60(2)Total food subsidies...... 125 450 450(2)      400(2)      350(2)      300(2)Commonwealth Sugar Agreement Supplementary Payments 35 -Table 7Rent freeze......... 70 70 30TablelODeferment of increase in school meals charge planned for april 1973(3)    ........ 20 13 5Table 4 and Table 6Nationalised industries&apos; price subsidies(*)      .      .      . 850 750 450(&apos;) Of which  10 million is financed from the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund.(^Unallocated.(3) On the assumptions outlined in Chapter 10 of Part 2.(*)The figures shown include payments made under the Statutory Corporations (Financial Provisions) Act 1974 as compensation tothe Post Office and gas and electricity industries specifically for the effects of price restraint (Table 4). They also subsume currentassistance to the National Coal Board (Table 4) and the British Rail Board (Table 6) though probably not all of this is due to theeffects of government action to keep down nationalised industry prices. This assistance has, as in the main tables, been shown againstthe year in which the deficit is incurred, rather than the year in which retrospective compensation is paid to the Boards. These figuresunderstate the true economic cost of price restraint, which, in addition to the deficits incurred, strictly includes the surpluses whichwould have otherwise been earned. Since this is a hypothetical figure which it is impossible to calculate precisely, no element ofthese foregone surpluses has been included in this table.

All figures rounded to nearest 100.(2) For the period 1975-1979, this is a holding figure.(3) Figures at 1.4.74 exclude Training Service Agency (6,200) which was set up on&apos;1.4.74; figures from 1.4.75 onwards also excludeEmployment Service Agency (ESA) (10,800) which will be set up on 1.10.74.(4) Adjusting for the exclusion of ESA during this period the increase is 41,800.1. The table above shows an increase of some41,800 in the total number of staff forecast over thefive-year period 1st April 1974 to 1st April 1979excluding the staff of the Manpower Services Com-mission and its Agencies; in percentage terms this is-1 per cent or an average annual rate of 2-5 percent for the first two years and of 0-4 per cent forthe last three years. Comparable forecasts for therest of the public service sector are not yet avail-able; but last year the Civil Service formed only18 per cent of total public service manpower andhad a significantly smaller percentage growth fore-cast.2. The first two lines in the table cover the depart-ments concerned with defence and external policy,the Ministry of Defence alone employing nearly two-fifths of the whole of the Civil Service. The Defenceentry is a holding figure pending the results of the review of Defence commitments referred to onpage 3.3. Increases in the Chancellor of the Exchequersdepartments are needed to provide additional stafiin the Inland Revenue to deal with the continuingextra work resulting from the 1974 Budget cornmit-ments and the computerisation of tax collection, andin the Customs and Excise, mainly for VAT. these increases have been partly offset by reductions in theDepartment for National Savings from 1976 onwardsas a result of computerisation and the centralisationof the National Savings Bank at Glasgow. There isa temporary increase in staff at the Royal Mint up to mid-1975 to cope with increased coin production atLlantrisant; and because the transfer of work toLlantrisant has been held up by delays in the new building programme.
4. The decrease in the Department of Employ-menfs staff is largely due to the transfer of staff to the Manpower Services Commission and its twoAgencies in 1973-74 and 1974-75; it is offset par-tially by extra staff required for benefit work.5; The increases shown in line 5 are mainly for there organisation of National Insurance and for in-creased contributory and supplementary benefit workin the Department of Health and-Social Security.6. The main factors in the manpower increases inthe Department of the Environment up to 1st April1976 are the build up of staff required for thecentralisation of driver and vehicle licensing workand the reinforcement of the driving test organisa-tion; the continuing contraction of the industriallabour force in the Property Services Agencybecause of improvements in productivity and efficiency, and reductions in commitments shouldoffset some of these increases.7. In the Home Office (line 7) the biggest increase is for the provision of staff in the Prison Service tokeep pace with the forecast increases in prisonpopulation and to reduce overcrowding and over-time working. This factor also affects scottish office requirements and is; the main reason for theincrease in line 8.8. Some 1,500 of the increase shown in fine 12 isfor staff of the Land Registry to cope with theproposed programme for the further extension of the compulsory registration of land. The staffing ofeach of the remaining departments (lines 9-13) is affected by several different factors each of which by itself does not have a significant effect.
7.  Infrastructure expenditure for North Sea oil1. Ministers agreed in April that expenditure oninfrastructure directly related to North Sea Oiloperations should be treated separately and not automatically reduced by the agreed formula.2. Officials have interpreted this expenditure toinclude that on projects which would not havetaken place within the Survey period but for theoff-shore oil developments, and projects which havebeen increased in scale or planned to be completedmore quickly or which, because of the oil develop-ments cannot be slowed down. It includes not onlythe obvious industrial infrastructure like roads, air-ports and harbours but also the social infrastructure(hospitals, schools, etc.) needed to accommodate thepopulation shift induced by North Sea Oil develop-ment. Expenditure on housing to accommodate the migrating population has not been included inthe following table since the housing programme is in any case not subject to the formula. the table below shows the amount of expenditure whichhas been treated separately for the purposes of the survey and which has been included in the relevantprogramme tables in Part II of the Report.  million at 1974 Survey prices1974-75      1975-76      1976-77      1977-78      197S-79Scottish Development DepartmentWater-Capital expenditure (Table 8) .Sewerage Capital expenditure (Table 8)Roads Motorways and trunk roads (Table 6)Local transport (Table 6)Scottish Home and Health DepartmentPolice (Table 9)......Fire (Table 9)......Hospital and community health centres (Table 11)Scottish Economic Planning DepartmentPorts-Lerwick (Table 6)   .Department of the EnvironmentPorts-Shetland (Table 6) .     .      .-Department of TradeAirport (Table 4)      ......Scottish Education DepartmentSchools (Table 10)    ...Further education (Table 10)Youth services (Table 10)   .Total......2-7	3-2	3-1	30	2-53-8	2-9	2-7	2-5 -	2-06-6	19-0	29-8	26-0	20-02-6	2-8Q	2-6	2-2	1-0	0-5	0-3	0-3	i      M 0-4	0-2	0-2	0-2	0-2 	4-0	4-0	4-0	4-00-9	10	01		-					100	120	15-0	15-0	0-7	0-4		&apos;J2-3	6-4	7-5	4-6	1-2	0-2	0-2	0-2	0-2:i iT-&apos;&apos;X-X	0-6	0-6	0-7	0-718-9	51-5	63-5	58-7    i	47-2
