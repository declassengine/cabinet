HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government(74) 78 COPY NO V 823 July 1974CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE: PROGRAMME ANALYSIS AND review memorandum by the Chancellor pf the exchequer. Public expenditure programmes need to be closely analysed if weare to have any assurance of getting them right, and keeping them right.A lot of progress was made by the last Labour Government.    our predecessors added a procedure which they called programme analysisand review (PAR).    The Chief Secretary has looked into this and I agreewith him that it should continue, but with modifications.    This memorandumexplains the system.PAR AS IT HAS DEVELOPED2. The idea behind PAR was that while the annual public expendituresurveys had made an important contribution to the planning and control ofpublic expenditure, they did not - indeed could not - include examinationsof major policy options.    This required a system of regular analyticalstudies in addition to purely Departmental reviews.    A procedure wasdevised to provide this by means of a selective programmej covering the field by talcing particular aspects of policy in turn over time.    Thiswas originally intended to operate on an annual cycle, from the choice ofthe year&apos;s studies to collective policy decisions by Ministers on each of the completed reports, with the aid of a collective brief by the Central policy review Staff (CPRS) relating the particular subjects to wider Governmentstrategy.    Special machinery was set up for formulating the programme ofstudies, through an interdepartmental Committee of officials (PARC) underthe same Treasury chairmanship as the Public Expenditure survey committee.3. This arrangement had some bad features which should go - notablyrigidities in the operation of the annual timetable, which made the systeminsensitive to changing requirements and priorities.    But the idea of acollectively formulated programme of analytical studies, the results ofwhich are considered by Ministers collectively, is valuable.4.        Analytical work, including an examination of objectives and how they may best be secured, must continue in any case.    The arrangement for central review and collective consideration by Ministers of certainstudies helps to counter the inevitable inertia in expenditure programmes
and to ensure that the options for new programmes are properly exposed.There is also a presentational aspect: to discontinue PAR as such would no doubt be misinterpreted as meaning that we were against this kind of fundamental and rigorous analysis, and it could well be difficult to defendin Parliament, in particular to the Expenditure Committee.PAR AS WE &quot;SHOULD RUN IT5,        I suggest therefore that we should aim to retain the best elements in PAR, along the lines of the note at Annex I which has been produced bythe interdepartmental Committee.    This revised procedure would stillensure that policy studies were regularly undertaken with systematiccoverage and penetration.   It would retain the interdepartmental machineryfor formulating the programme collectively; the continued involvement ofthe central Departments in this process and at key stages in each individualstudy; and the requirement that studies should emerge in the form of reports for collective consideration by Ministers, with a collective briefby the CPRS to help us.    But it would discard the rigidity of a strict annualcycle, and would make it possible for new studies to be started during theyear, and also for particular studies to be completed in more or less thana year if this seemed appropriate - or to be stopped if they were not goingto be profitable after all.6.        At Annex II is the list of studies in progress or proposed for this andfuture years.    But the proposed procedure makes this list subject toconsidered amendments at any time.WHAT TO PUBLISH7.        I have coneidered whether we should change our predecessors1practice of not revealing the list of these studies.    The problem here is that what is written to help us to think out policy and what is written to put that policy before the public may need to be separate stages forus; but once it is known that a particular PAR study is in progress, therewill inevitably be pressure for the report and material to be published,whereas we may often regard this as inappropriate.    I hope that we would do more to publish results of PAR studies and material collected for them,in whatever form is most appropriate.   But we must retain our freedom ofaction to decide in each case whether to publish anything, and, if so, whatand how.    I endorse therefore the approach adopted in paragraphs 16 and 17of Annex I,conclusion. I invite my colleagues to apply the procedure outlined in Annex subject to review of its working in a year&apos;s time.D treasury Chambers23 July 1974
ANNEX IGUIDANCE OK THE WORKING OF PROGRAMME ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (PAP.)Introducjilpn1 * Policy reviews are part of the regular &quot;business of government.They need to &quot;bring to bear a wide range of enquiry and analysis,not all necessarily familiar in day-to-day work They may dealwith new policies, perhaps on the initiative of Ministers; andthese policies may or may not span departmental boundaries.. Crthey may concern continuing programmes - again, Departmental orinterdepartmentalc2*     &quot;PAR&quot; studies may have any of these characteristic8*   Thefeatures which should distinguish a &quot;PAR&quot; from a purely&quot;Departmental study (even one involving, say, the Treasury in thenormal way) are:i*     it is an analytical review of important concernsiio     the interests of central Departments&apos;will be sufficientlyinvolved to justify their taking part and contributingjandiiie     the choices likely to emerge will be such that Ministersought to consider them collectively*3. This note suggests a framework within which &quot;PAR&quot; reviews raiphibe conducted, and some guidelines for what they should contain-.Procedure iU&apos;e     The Treasury? under the Chief Secretary, is responsible to ministers collectively for the organisation of these studies.   TheGPRS are also closely associated with the &quot;PAR&quot; programme in viewof their responsibilities for the review of Government strategy,objectives and prioritieso   The CSD are also concerned,particularly in view of their responsibility for staffing.
The Treasury arranges, through the Committee on Programme Analysisd Review (PARC) a Stocktaking and selection process each springs   EotiOle spending and the central Departments then propose what programme orLies should be reviewedcI   There are no hard-and-fast criteria for the selection of topics,Ir &quot;PAR&quot; has a number of objectives *   But it has been found most worth-ghilc to examine policy issues where one can pose questions about howKst to use resources to serve objectives which Departments, or the[overnment as a whole, are aiming ato,   The emphasis will generally be on public, expenditure programmes,ince o)ie or the aims is to relate expenditure to objectives, but issuesiivolying private sector resources, whether or not in conjunction withiiblic sector- programmes, may be covered where these are amenable^ toGovernment action^Host of the proposed studies are likely to be originated bymending Departments .   In January and February of each year, each department represented on the Committee is asked to prepare a list of subjects proposed for review by &quot;PAR&quot; over a period of approximately thefollowing three years, taking account of earlier proposals which remain[relevant*   The subjects should be arranged in order of priority;   theyfeed not correspond to any set timetable? although it is assumed thathe studies will on average take about a year to complete;   some indica-ion should however be given of when each review may be expected to start.jj).    For the Committee1? information only, Departments are also asked tonclude in this list, but identified separately, topics scheduled foreview by other means (internally, by Royal Commission, by outside[consultants etc) which serve to illuminate the choice, of &quot;PAR&quot; topics;they may also wish to include topics which could be suitable &quot;PAR&quot;candidates at some future date, but not necessarily within the timetableof the forward programme o10.   While Departments are preparing their lists, the central departments will compile their own list for consideration.   This listwill take account of the main strategic policy themes of currentconcern and put&apos; forward a number of subjects In order of priority
11.   All these lists should &quot;be circulated by   1 March   to thisCommittee, which will he responsible for producing a balanced andco-ordinated forward programme of &quot;PAR&quot; studies for submission to ministers collectively.    It will normally meet for this purpose not later than   1 April   each year.   The Committee.will, agree priorities and arrange which Department takes the lead for each inter-Departmentaltopic.    It&apos; will watch the total load of the studies on individual departments,   The&quot; final list for each Department will show projectedreviews, both Departmental ana inter-Departmental, in order of priority12.   The *PAR&quot; programme, so compiled, will be submitted to the chief secretary for approval, Departments meanwhile seeking clearance fromtheir own Ministers4   The Chief Secretary will then circulate it to ministers collectively, normally for information only,- on the basis thathis represents a stocktaking of policy reviews at a certain point intime, and that the programme will be flexible.   New requirements are bound to arise from time to time for policy reviews stuitable for VPAR11treatment, on which an early start must be made:    the Ministers directIconcerned will then be asked to agree to a simple change in a Departmenpriority list, which may or may not entail putting aside work already ihand.   The official Committee will be kept informed of such changes.Other items will sometimes be dropped, following changed, policies orcircumstances.13*   There is nO final commitment in putting an item in the programme.But to establish such a programme is helpful.    It gives Ministers and central Departments some kind of strategic oversight of the policyanalyses planned over the whole field of Government: and it enablesDepartments to plan in advance the collection of statistical and other information which will be needed in the fairly near future for theanalytical work of the review.1h,    Individual studies are a co-operative effort,, although the -leadDepartment carries the major responsibility.    The detailed arrangementsfor the preparation of the studies are a matter for- the Department (or&quot;Departments) primarily concerned, who will need to   consider for examplthe most appropriate division of responsibility between the Departmentsplanning unit and the divisions responsible for the operation of theprogramme concerned.   The Treasury will from time to time convene .meetings with the Department a2id the GPRS to consider the various rta;eof the work,.

Definition;of .Topics18a Experience has shown that the exact formulation of the subject for the study is often crucial to its success or failure   Reviewsdefined in terms of existing policy instruments (eg specific grants or cash benefits) are not likely to be satisfactory, because there isno room to explore a number of real options.,   It is better to -anticipathis problem by taking a broader theme (eg Urban Transport, Assistanceto the Disabled, the Treatment of Offenders and Rural Depopulation)b1 9o Readfbilitv.......pnd^resen t g t i on. of &quot;PAR&quot; reports is more important than some authors have realised.   The reports are intended for ministers dollectively, not just for Departmental Ministers.   Theseare busy people, probably with no special knowledge which would makethe report easier to read.    A study well written and. presented standsa good chance of being considered fully and sympathetically.   Ashort main report is suggested, written in a lively style, compressedin argument yet embodying the essential stages of the analysis.   Agreat deal of the supporting work can often be relegated to annexes&apos;some Ministers will choose to read these, and their presence indicatessomething of the analytical work done.   The design of fcables isimportant, and not difficult if one considers the reader rather thanthe way the material comes out.   The presence of well-planned graphsor.diagrams,, especially early in the report, may help a lot.20s   An outline of the study deserves time and. effort spent on it atan early stage of the work.    By choosing and refining the mostimportant issues, and the objectives, it saves everyone&apos;s time later on.21o The&apos; structure of a report must suit the subject.
