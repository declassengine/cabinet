DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 16 COPY NO       I26 March 1974CABINETCHANNEL tunnel memorandum by, the Secretary of State forthe EaMronmentINTRODUCTION1.        Following our previous discussion (CC(74) 3rd Conclusions, Item 5)I was invited to submit a further paper dealing with a number of issuesi which arose in discussion.2. When in Opposition we divided the House on an Amendment whichsaid that we were not opposed in principle to a Channel Tunnel, but wanted a re-examination of alternative transport strategies.    I assume that we donot want to execute our first U-turn, and therefore that we would wish to conduct such a re-examination rather than to cancel at once; the more sosince the Tunnel, unlike Concorde and the Third London Airport, hasbeen the subject of detailed debate only since the first cost-benefit studieswere published last summer.PHASE 23.        Since that vote in the House, Phase 2 has begun as a result of the signing of Agreement No. 2 with the French.    The question thereforearises: can we in practice conduct the re-examination while simultaneouslyputting Phase 2 on ice ?   Can and should we stop all Phase 2 work while the project is re-examined? ii4. Phase 2 work consists of digging of two pilot sections of the servicetunnels some 2km long in each side of the Channel, final design work, andthe reassessment of the project leading to the final financial negotiations.5.        First, would we save any money by stopping Phase 2 work whilethe re-examination proceeded?   The answer is: yes, a small amount ofmoney if re-examination ultimately led to abandonment.    But converselyif re-examination confirmed the case for the project, we should have addeda considerable additional cost.    The details are set out in Annex A.1
6. Secondly, could we keep our options open if we now stoppedPhase 2 work?    This seems most unlikely for the reasons set out indetail in Annex A.    I think we must accept that stopping work on Phase 2would amount to an instant decision to abandon.    The costs of abandon-ment are set out in Annex B.7. Thirdly, do we keep our options open if we continue Phase 2 work?The answer is unambiguously yes; and the Law Officers agree with this.Phase 2 lasts until mid-1975.    We can abandon at the end of this phase,the costs falling on the Governments being shared 50:50 with France.There is no commitment to proceed beyond Phase 2 unless or until agreement No. 3 is signed.    The whole scheme has been designed to allow a specific break point in mid-1975 in addition to the general provisionsfoy abandonment at any time.    In this it differs significantly from the concorde situation.    The Treaty has been signed but cannot be ratifieduntil the powers needed to implement it have been provided by Parliament.The Bill in this country, and ratification of the Treaty in France, wouldprovide the essential powers for construction and operation of the Tunnel.But it would not involve any new commitment to carry out the project.The only document which would commit us to Phase^ would be AgreementNo. 3.8. Fourthly, if we continue with Phase 2, can we make the changesin the strategy which we want?   In particular, can we orient the Tunnelmuch more in the direction of rail?    The answer is yes.i i     &quot;9.   (i) There is nothing in the Agreements or Treaty to prevent us andBritish Railways, on a national basis or in association with theGovernments and railways on the continent, from taking steps to increasethrough rail traffic.(ii) Under 1966 agreement which is enshrined in the present arrange-ments, the Tunnel Authority would not be able to discriminate betweenthrough rail traffic and vehicle ferry traffic.    And we are bound toprovide access for both.    But there is no restriction on our general policies aimed at diverting traffic to rail.(iii) Changes in the road v rail strategy would not affect the Tunnelstructure, and any changes in the initial provision to be made for vehicletraffic, including the scale of provision at Cheriton, which emerge fromthe joint reassessment of the traffic forecasts should present no problem,ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION10.       It was suggested that the economic justification of the scheme hadnot been adequately examined.    Without doubt the traffic, revenue andfinancial forecasts, which were published in some detail last summer,require re-examination in the light of developments, notably the changein the energy situation.    That work is in hand.    Under my proposals in2
paragraph 14b of C(74) 8, I and the Minister for Transport would examine the adequacy of these reviews; and I propose to employ an outside economist to assist us.    Similarly, we will certainly wish to review the existing cost-benefit study in the light of the new forecasts.11,       The traffic and revenue studies were carried out, and theirreassessment is being undertaken, by Coopers and Lybrand and SETEC-Economie on lines agreed by the Companies and the Governments, who  can (and in my case will) take whatever specialist advice they wish.The assumptions and methodology have all to be agreed with theGovernments, and their representatives have free access to all staff and work in progress.    It would not be possible for the current joint reassess-ment to be transferred completely to other consultants, even if this weredesirable.    But the question of an outside assessment of the consultants1views is a point which I would wish to consider further, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer.CONCLUSION12.       I must ask my colleagues to remember that we cannot do nothing.Traffic with the Continent is growing and will go on growing.    If we donot build the Tunnel we will have, in the end, to devote more investmentresources to the air and sea services with their associated roads and ports and airport facilities.   In particular, the cost and difficulty ofproviding for traffic at the London airports would be greatly increased;and the beast Maplin might once again rear its ugly head.    We would alsolose the best opportunity of diverting traffic to rail from the overburdenedroads to the ports.    We need to reassess the balance between the Tunneland the alternatives, but the alternatives will also involve investment ona very heavy scale.13.       Completing Phase 2 in no way commits us to sign Agreement No. or to anything beyond mid-1975.    On the other hand, to abandon the projectnow means losing all prospect of any Tunnel in the foreseeable future.We cannot put the project into cold storage - the effect would be to abandon.The only way to keep our options open until we have confirmed whetherthe Tunnel is the cheapest and best method of meeting the needs ofcross-Channel traffic and whether we can obtain any necessary changesin the scheme is to allow Phase 2 to continue.14.      I invite my colleagues to endorse the conclusions in paragraph 14of C(74) 8.A,department of the Environment26 March 19743
(confidential)ANNEX A^ lTHE IMPLICATIONS OP STOPPING WORK WHILE THE PROJECT IS RE-EXAMINED(a) Work is actively in progress.    Two main contracts $achworth some  6-7 million and a whole host of smalle&apos;&apos; onesare in hand.    To cancel the contracts, &quot;demobilise   themen and equipment, and then relet the contracts wo Lid be extremely expensive.    The direct cost of Phase II would beincreased by some  3 million in total, after allowing forthe cancellation charges, the duplication of costs, etc.The eventual impact of these costs and of the delay on &quot;the out-turn costs if the project went ahead would be more thanthe additional costs at risk if we continue Phase II before deciding whether to abandon;(b) It is very doubtful whether the expert management teamscould be kept together if there were a break.of any length;(c) And crucially, while we can abandon the project at any time,it can only be kept alive by agreement with the FrenchGovernment and the Companies.    Agreement No 2 includes*      provisions about the work to be carried out in Phase II andthe arrangements for financing it related to an agreedtimetable.    If &quot;either of the Governments by executive action taken specifically with respect to the /Project make sit impossible for either of the Companies to discharge any obligation&apos;5 or if the Treaty is not ratified by the due date,we will have abandoned.In view of (a) and (b) above, I believe it most unlikely that our partners would agree to stop work on the project, while we re-examineit, even if we agreed to bear everyone&apos; s extra costs.
ANNEX BCOST OP ABANDONMENTThe way the costs of abandonment are shared between theGovernments and Companies in different circumstances are setout in Agreement No 2.    The cost to the Governments of anyabandonment however occurring, are shared equally between thetwo Governments.    The cost to &apos;HMG of abandonment in variouscircumstances would be approximately as follows:^ . (a)   Abandonment by the Governments immediately:        8-Jm(b)   Abandonment at the end of Phase II(i) jointly by Governments and Companies:  13m(ii) by the Companies alone:  13m (thoughthe Governments also acquire the Companies1 assets free)CLii) jointly by Governments and Companies as aresult of failure to agree on the forecastrevenue of the Tunnel and so on thebasis for negotiating the financial terms:about  17m(iv) by the Governments though the Companieswish to continue on terms consistent with Agreement No 2 up to      22mIf it was decided between now and the end of Phase,II toabandon the project, the cost to HMG would be between  8;and  22m depending on. the time at which the decision x-;astaken.-m
