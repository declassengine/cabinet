LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1974-75 session memorandum by the Lord President of the council, The Queen&apos;s Speech and Future Legislation Committee has now considered proposals for legislation during the 1974-75 Session.    Theprogramme we recommend is in Annex A.2.        The Bills have been grouped as follows:  Essential;  Contingent(i,e. Bills which might become essential during the Session);  main programme (sub-divided into Top Priority; Priority;  and No Priority);Scottish Grand Committee Bills; Second Reading Committee Bills;  and private Members1 Bills,3,        Although we are working on the assumption of a Session lastingabout a year, we have not yet taken any final decision.    In order to keepopen our options on this we must ensure that our most important s*id urgentBills get Royal Assent as soon as possible, so that the Session could beended earlier without losing them.    But there is not much time availablefor Bills before the Summer Recess, so we can admit into this crucialcategory only a few major Bills which can be got ready quickly.4.        We have accordingly divided the Main Programme Bills into three categories: Top Priority, Priority and No Priority.    Our aim would be toensure that the Top Priority Bills (together with the Essential Bills) areenacted before the Summer Recess;  and to avoid obstructing theirprogress, whether in preparation or in Parliament, we would not commit ourselves at this stage on the timing of introduction of any Bills in the priority category.    The Lord Privy Seal, the Chief Whips and I will keepthe situation under review as the Session progresses and individual ministers should consult me about the best time for bringing a PriorityBill forward.    Meanwhile, of course, Departments should get on as quickly as they can with their preparatory work, and should seek myauthority for the employment of Parliamentary Counsel when they are ready.   We would certainly hope that it will be possible to give at least some of the Priority Bills, notably Safety of Sports Grounds, Control of pollution, Social Security Act 1973 Amendment and Merchant Shippinga Second Reading before the Summer Recess.C(74)21 COPY NO     7g2 April 1974CABINET
5.      We have not attempted to establish any order of priority amongBills in the Second Reading Committee list because we think it would be preferable to defer consideration of whether any such Bills should beintroduced until we see how the Session progresses.    Such Bills take upno Floor time in the Commons but they add to the burden on the Lords.6.        The Prime Minister has asked that Departments should be ready to publish White Papers setting out the proposals which would be brought forward in major Bills not yet ready and for which time is not likely to beavailable before the autumn.7.        I seek my colleagues agreement to the programme set out in/Annex A. / /ES     nPrivy Council Office2 April 19742
