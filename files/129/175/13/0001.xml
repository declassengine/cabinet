CONCORDEMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The memorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry (C(74) 10)proposes that a decision on Concorde should be postponed pending a select Committee report, consultation with interested parties and negotiations with the French.    In my view the economic arguments for taking a decision now, without embarking on a lengthy and expensiveprocess of consultation - Concorde is costing us  4 million a month - areoverwhelming.2. The facts were revealed to the House on Monday, but it isnecessary to repeat them here.    The latest estimate of total development costs for the existing version of the aircraft is  1070 million.    Our shareof this is  535 million, of which  130 million remains to be spent.    none of this  535 million will be recovered, and on all past experience the finalbill is likely to be substantially higher.    Production of 16 aircraft hasbeen authorised, but only 9 have been sold - to British Airways andAir France - as captive customers - and there is little prospect of sellingfurther aircraft to the present specification.    Moreover there will be a production loss to the United Kingdom of  6 million per aircraft sold,even after writing off the development costs, and British Airways willincur an operating loss on Concorde operations now estimated at 30 million in a representative year.3. The manufacturers have recently put forward proposals for asubstantial new development programme to improve the performance andnoise levels of the aircraft, at an additional cost estimated by officials to be at least  220 million (about half borne by the United Kingdom), andfor the production of 60 aircraft by 1982.    Again, none of this development expenditure would be recovered and there would be asubstantial production loss on each aircraft sold.    But the marketassessment by United Kingdom and French officials is that it would be some years before there would be serious airline interest and even thenorders would be doubtful.1C(74) 13 COPY NO  &apos; 020 March 1974CABINET
4. On 19 February the French Government announced that they wouldbe prepared to authorise manufacture of a further three aircraft(Nos 17-19) and approve a minor part of the manufacturers1 proposedimprovements (a bigger fuel tank and minor modifications costing 20- 25 million to develop) but in effect rejected the manufacturers&apos;major proposals for an improved engine and an improved wing design.The Conservative Government reserved their position on the french governments proposals.. -5. Clearly the manufacturers&apos; proposals must be ruled out right away;there is no justification for adding to the waste of resources alreadydevoted to this project, and if the firms&apos; plans were adopted the bill couldbe open-ended.    There then remain three main options:A. To cancel the pioject.B. To limit development and production to the present programme of 16 aircraft.C. To accept the French proposal.The costs of these options at current prices over 1974-75 to 1977-78 aredetailed in Annex A, together with their consequences for public expenditure as set out in the last Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 5519) (whichwas at September 1972 prices).6,        It can be seen straightaway from the second half of the Annex that,even after meeting cancellation costs, termination of the project(Course A) should bring large savings on the White Paper figures, startingwith nearly  40 million in 1974-75 (the saving compared with the actualprovision in the 1974-75 Supply Estimates would be less - about 24 million).    Limiting production to the 16 already authorised (Course B)would still leave us with most of the expenditure projected in the white paper, even before allowing for further cost escalation.    Acceptance ofthe French Governments proposals (Course C) would add to the white paper figures and could well be the first step to involvement in a massivenew programme.7. The facts and figures speak for themselves.    The figures may be capable of some further refinement, but as broad orders of magnitudethey provide an adequate basis for decisions now.    Clearly we must setout to cancel the project and should propose this course to the French.The alternative of limiting production to 16, with no further development,would very likely be a half-way house to cancellation, as it would be clearthat this was not a viable programme.    It would be a much less satisfactory way of ending the project, but we might be forced to adopt it as an interim measure if the French did not agree to outright cancellation.    Course Chas nothing to recommend it: the proposed improvements would not makethe aircraft significantly more saleable.
i   8. Officials have advised that termination of Concorde would not prejudice the continuation of a viable and leaner, if somewhat smaller,British aircraft industry.    But I agree that we must consider carefullyhow to handle the employment implications.    Concorde supports some21, 000 jobs, including 9, 000 in sub-contractors.    Of the total about13, 000 are spread throughout the country, mostly outside assisted areas,and officials have advised that their loss should be absorbed withoutparticular difficulty.    However, special measures might be needed to dealwith the effects of cancellation on the 8, 000 jobs in the Bristol area, and time would be needed for redeployment of this workforce.    I suggest thereshould be an interdepartmental group of officials to consider and reporturgently on the necessary measures.f     &quot; &apos; II &apos;9. I ask my colleagues to agree that:1. We should decide in favour of cancelling the concorde project at the earliest possible date.2.        An interdepartmental group should be set up to advise on special measures to deal with the particular problem ofredundancies in the Bristol area.3,        If the French attitude prevents immediate cancellation,we should do no more than maintain the 16 aircraft production programme, with no further development, as an interim stagetowards cancellation.&apos;&apos; -     &quot;&quot;n&apos; -&quot;til4.        In that event, I should be authorised to say in my budget speech that, while decisions on the existing development and production programmes remain to be taken after consultation withthe French, we have decided not to authorise any additionaldevelopment or production.D W treasury Chambers20 March 19743
