STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR foreign and COMONWEALTH AFFAIRS IN THE COUNCIL OFMINISTERS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES in luxembourg ON 1 APRIL 19741. Mr. Chairman, with your permission I should like to make a state-ment about the policy of my Government towards the Community. It will come as no surprise to you that the Labour Government opposes member-ship of the Community on&apos;the terms that were negotiated at the time ofour entry in January 1973. We do not consider that they provided for afair balance of advantages in the Community and we are of the opinionthat the terms should have been specifically put to the British people fortheir approval or otherwise. We wish to put these errors right and if wesucceed there will then be a firm basis for continuing British membership of a strengthened Community.I &apos;2.  We seek to raise with1 you a number of important questions on which my Government consider a successful renegotiation to  be necessary.We   shall  negotiate   in  good   faith   and   if   we   are   successful  in achieving the right terms we shall put them to our people for approval.But if we fail, we shall submit to the British people the reason why we find the terms unacceptable and consult them on the advisability of negotiating the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Community.I am confident that no one in the Community would wish to argue that itwould be in the interests of the Community to seek to retain my country as a member against its will.   But I stress that I do not hope for a negotiation about withdrawal.   I would prefer successful renegotiationfrom which the right terms for continued membership will emerge.   Tosome extent that will depend upon us but it will also depend upon theattitude of the other partners in the negotiations.3. For our part, we have made clear in the Labour Party Manifestofor the recent election that &quot;Britain is a European nation, and a LabourBritain would always seek a wider co-operation between the Europeanpeoples.&quot; I would now like to quote a passage of fundamental importanceto my Government from our Manifesto. In our view the terms of entrynegotiated by the previous Government involved, as we have said, &quot; theimposition of food taxes on top of rising world prices, crippling freshburdens on our balance of payments, and a draconian curtailment of thepower of the British Parliament to settle questions affecting vital Britishinterests.&quot; This is why we are immediately seeking a fundamental renegoti-ation of the terms of entry, for which we have spelled out our objectives in the following terms-&quot;The Labour Party opposes British membership of the european communities on the terms negotiated by the Conservative Government.We have said that we are ready to renegotiate.In preparing to renegotiate the entry terms, our main objectives arethese 
Major changes in the Common Agricultural Policy, so that it ceases to be a threat to world trade in food products, and so that low-costproducers outside Europe can continue to have access to theBritish food market.New and fairer methods of financing the COMMUNITY BUDGET.Neither the taxes that form the so-called &apos; own resources&apos; ofthe Communities, .nor the purposes, mainly agricultural support,on which the funds are mainly to be spent, are acceptable to us.We would be ready to contribute to Community finances only such sums as were fair in relation to what is paid and what is receivedby other member countries.As stated earlier, we would reject any kind of international agreement which compelled us to accept increased unemployment for the sake of maintaining a fixed parity, as is required by current proposalsfor a European ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION. Webelieve that the monetary problems of the European countries canbe resolved ; only in a world-wide framework.The retention1&apos;by PARLIAMENT of those powers over the British economy needed to pursue effective regional, industrial and fiscalpolicies. Equally we need an agreement on capital movementswhich protects our balance of payments and full employmentpolicies. The economic interests of the COMMONWEALTH andthe DEVELOPING COUNTRIES must be better safeguarded. this involves securing continued access to (the British market and, more generally, the adoption by an enlarged Community of trade and aidpolicies designed to benefit not just &apos; associated overseas territories &apos;in Africa, but developing countries throughout the world.No harmonisation of VALUE ADDED TAX which would require usto tax necessities.If renegotiations are successful, it is the policy of the Labour party that, in view of the unique importance of the decision,.the people should have the right to decide the issue through a General Electionor a Consultative Referendum. If these; two, tests are passed, a successful renegotiation and the expressed approval of the majorityof the British people, then we shall be ready to play our full partin developing a new and wider Europe.If renegotiations do not succeed, we shall not regard the Treaty obliga-tions as binding upon us. We shall then put to the British people the reasons why we find the new terms unacceptable, and consult them on the advisability of negotiating our withdrawal from the communities.An incoming Labour Government will immediately set in train the procedures designed to achieve an early result and whilst the negotiationsproceed and until the British people have voted, we shall stop furtherprocesses of integration, particularly as they affect food taxes. TheGovernment will be free to take decisions, subject to the authority ofParliament, in cases where decisions of the Common Mafket prejudge the negotiations. Thus, the right to decide the final issue of british entry into the Market will be restored to the British people.&quot;
4. My Government now propose that we should consider together how these objectives can be met. In view of the great importance of the issueof membership of the Community, my Government is now engaged in aroot and branch review of the effect of Community policies and will place before you in due course in detail the proposals which we would wish tosee the Community adopt in order to remedy the situation. In particular,we are examining with great care the working of the Common agricultural policy; the estimates for future contributions to and receipts from theCommunity budget; the Community&apos;s trade and aid policies towards theCommonwealth and developing countries and how far in practice theexisting rules, as they are interpreted, interfere with the powers over theBritish economy which we need to pursue effective regional, industrial andfiscal policies. As soon as this review is completed, we shall be readyto put forward proposals for the changes which will in our view be necessary if Britain is to remain a member of the Community and thus, as the manifesto put it, &quot; to play our full part in developing a new and widerEurope &quot;.5. Why do my Government, and indeed the British people, questionwhether all is well in the Community as it is and why are we planning to seek changes?6. First, we were deeply concerned by the resolutions of March 1971and 1972 which were confirmed at the Summit Meeting of October 1972.They seemed to lay down a rigid programme under which Economic and monetary Union, including permanently fixed parities, would be achieved by 1980. This seemed to us to be dangerously over-ambitious: over-ambitious because the chances of achieving by 1980 the requisite degree ofconvergence of the rates of growth of productivity and wages rates, of investment and savings, seemed to us to be very small: dangerous becauseof the impossibility for any country, particularly a country with a relatively low growth rate, to manage its own economy efficiently and provide for full employment if it accepted permanently fixed parities without&apos; suchconvergence having been achieved. I understand that much new thinkingis going on in the Community on the subject of Economic and MonetaryUnion and that the proposals now being considered for a second stage init do not provide for automatic movement towards permanently fixed parities.You will find our objections very much lessened if we can all agree thatthere can be no question of trying to force the pace, of compelling member countries to accept permanently fixed parities if this means acceptingmassive unemployment or before their economies are ready.7. Then we are concerned at another phrase from the Paris SummitCommunique at the intention there stated of transforming the wholecomplex of the relations of member states into a European Union by 1980.What does this mean? Is it to be taken literally? It seems to us to imply a change which is quite unrealistic and not desired by our peoples,certainly not by the British people. I understand that work on clarifyingthis issue is about to begin within the Community. I shall watch carefullyto see if this clarification will help to relieve our anxieties.8. Then there is the Common Agricultural Policy. The position ofthe United Kingdom is different from that of the other Members of the
Community in an important sense. We import a very much larger proportionof our food and if we have to pay a high price for these imports, this can impose a heavy burden on our balance of payments. This is muchmore of a problem for us than for other Members. We are of course aware that the Community&apos;s prices are at present lower than they were relative to other Community prices and that many of them are now below world prices. But how long will this last? We are unable to agree to perpetuatepolicies that would allow the butter mountains and the cheap butter sales toRussia to recur. Are you sure that there will be no future mountain of beefin store? Have the interests of the consumer been sufficiently safeguarded?Could overseas producers have better access to Community markets? Isfinancial control sufficiently strict? It is our view that more needs to bedone to keep down the cost of the CAP which accounts for 80 per cent of the Community budget. At present the system does not take sufficientaccount of the differing interests and circumstances of member countries.It confers privileges on some and imposes unfair burdens on others. Thatis why we shall certainly be proposing major changes.9. Then there is the question of the trade of Commonwealth and developing countries, which is linked with the Common Agricultural Policybecause of the need to offer a fair deal, to the Community&apos;s consumersas well as to the suppliers overseas. We are not satisfied that the arrange-ments made in the entry negotiations are as good as they should have been,for the one or for the other. We have in mind not only sugar and NewZealand butter, but the position of those Commonwealth countries for whomthe option of Association is not open. Apart from changes in the field ofthe Common Agricultural Policy, no doubt the general position could be improved if the Community&apos;s generalised preference scheme undergoes seriousimprovement both in the industrial and agricultural sectors; if the Communitywhen it comes to draw up its detailed mandate for the multilateral trade negotiations takes a liberal attitude, especially about agricultural trade; andif the Protocol 22 negotiations result in really generous terms for access toour markets of developing countries&apos; agricultural products, which is&apos; onthe whole what they want to sell, as well as for their industrial products.There is also the field of aid in which in our view the Community should look wider than those countries eligible for association. We are examiningthis whole field most carefully in the context of renegotiation in order tosee what should be done.10. I turn next to the question whether existing rules interfere with thepowers over the British economy which we need to pursue effective regional,industrial, fiscal and counter-inflationary policies. We want to be sure that,in cases where jobs are in danger or where there is a need to sustain and develop valuable industrial capacity, we can give aid quickly and effectively.To give another example, co-ordination of regional aids can usefully preventover-bidding for internationally available funds. But there is a majordifference between those regional problems which are mainly agricultural and those which are mainly industrial. We want to make sure, in particular,that, against this background, we can continue to give our own assisted areas the help which they need.11. Finally, I come to the Community budget. Here fundamental changes are required.   Britain&apos;s income per head and her rate of growth
is lower than in many of your countries. I take it you would agree that the out-turn of the Community budget should not in all justice result in massivesubsidies across the exchanges from my country to yours. This is not acceptable.12. We are not asking for charity. We seek a fair deal. In 1973 onlypaying 8  per cent of the Community budget in accordance with the transi-tional key, we were already the second largest net contributors. At the endof our normal transitional period we shall be paying over 19 per cent, well over the 16^ per cent which is our likely share of GNP at that time. If thefull &quot; own resources &quot; system were to be applied to us with no changes in1980; we should find ourselves paying still more, perhaps several percentagepoints more, of the Community budget in even sharper contrast with the relatively low share of GNP we can then expect to have. I am sure you1will agree that something must be done about that. Britain cannot accepta permanent drain across the exchanges of several hundred million poundssterling a year.13. You will wish to know how we would propose that this renegotia-tion should proceed. I can assure the Council that we do not wish to disruptthe work of the Community more than is necessary during the period of renegotiation.14. I shall come back to the Council at an early date with detailed proposals on the Common Agricultural Policy, the treatment of the Common-wealth and of developing countries, the Community budget and other areasof difficulty in the economic field. I hope yoh will agree then to havea general discussion; and to agree how certain of our requests for changes inthe Community&apos;s arrangements should be handled.15. Our initial approach will be to seek changes in the Community&apos;spolicies and decisions which will meet our needs. uWe must see how we goand where we get. But we shall have to reserve the right to propose changesin the Treaties if it should turn out that essential interests cannot be met without them. I must also reserve the right to propose changes-in the treaties, if we find that in practice the existing rules, as they are interpreted,interfere with the powers over the British economy which we need to pursueeffective regional, industrial and fiscal policies.16. I have spoken so far today about bread and butter issues for theseare very important to all our people. But we are also deeply concerned about the politics of the Community; about the broad direction which it is going to take both in its internal development and in its relations withother countries or groups of countries.17. The image of the Community in the United Kingdom is not good.My country wishes to remain a member of an effective Atlantic Alliance;and there is therefore concern about the degree of disagreement between theCommunity and the United States. Surely this is not inevitable. If theBritish people thought it was, it would adversely influence their attitudetowards the development of the Community.18. We shall not always be able to agree with the United States butthe Community in devising its procedures and its common positions must always try to work with America whenever it can.   Conversely Americaft!&apos;!
must try and work with us. Only if the Nine work harmoniously with theUnited States on both economic issues in the framework of theCommunity and on political issues in the framework of political co-operation,shall we surmount the difficulties to which President Nixon and Dr. Kissingerhave recently drawn attention.19. We should also like to work with you to produce a stable, healthyand co-operative relationship with all those countries or groups of countries with whom Europe&apos;s life is intimately connected, for example with Japan,Canada and other industrialised countries; with the Commonwealth andthe Community&apos;s Associates; with the Arab countries; and with the soviet union and Eastern Europe.20. We are ready to intensify political consultation and co-operation.But before we can do so we need to agree on our broad aims. I should certainly like to see if we can do this together. The informal meeting towhich our President has so kindly invited us later this month will provide an excellent opportunity.21. So to conclude we shall work for an early and successful result to what we in Britain have come to call renegotiation. Meanwhile we shallparticipate in the work of the Community and act in accordance with Com-munity procedures, subject only to not &quot;proceeding with further processes of integration if these seem likely to prejudge the outcome of the negotia-tions. Our aim will be to get an agreement which can be regarded as providing a fair balance of advantage for each of our countries. If this canbe achieved successfully, renegotiation will not damage the Community but will strengthen it.Printed in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office3148563  Dd 253335  K24  4/74ISBN 0  10  155930  5
