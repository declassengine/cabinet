HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74)4 COPY NO       ^ g12 March 1974CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1974-75.11Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. We need to decide at once whether we should modify in anyway the public expenditure figures for 1974-75, as they stand afterthe cuts which my predecessor announced on 17 December.    Thiswill affect the decisions in my Budget.2. We are committed to giving the highest priority to up-ratingsocial security benefits, and also to effective action on prices andrents.    These measures will involve us in very large additional public spending in 1974-75:-,  i.    Social Security,   The minimum improvement to which any Government is now committed is to compensate forerosion of the purchasing power of benefits.    To do this an extra  360 million has to be spent in 1974-75 in any case.But we are committed to raise pensions to  10 per week forthe single person ( 16 per week for married couples).    Thiswill cost at least a further  260 million in 1974-75, making 620 million in all, assuming that we bring these new levels of benefit into payment at the beginning of October.    To bringthe date forward would cost approaching  100 million inaddition for each month.ii..   Food subsidies.    We are committed also to food subsidies,but have to work out the details.    The cost of reducing the retail Price Index in this way by 1 per cent could be 400 million in the year.iii.     Housing.   We have already announced the rent freeze,which will cost  70 million in 1974-75.    Our other plans for housing, including encouraging the municipalisation ofrented houses and giving security to tenants of furnished accomodation, will add large amounts to public expenditure,which is already growing rapidly for this programme.
3. On top of these expenditures, there are going to be difficultdecisions on nationalised industries prices and subsidies.    Even afterthe immediate increase in industrial coal prices, and assuming that thisis passed on to industrial users of electricity, there will still be some 1, 200 million to be found for the nationalised industries in 1974-75either by price increases, affecting domestic as well as industrial users,or by subsidies.4. Both to ensure balance in the economy and to avoid a disastrousloss of confidence, I must show in my Budget how the extra expenditure,and the effects on demand of all these additional commitments, are goingto be met by increased taxation or contributions.    This will be againstthe prospect of an enormous balance of payments deficit - forecast atover  4, 000 million.    There is a compelling need to make a real start with putting the non-oil balance of payments right.    We cannot do sounless we succeed in holding the public sector&quot;s demand on resources and the borrowing requirement to manageable figures;  and also adopt the policies which will  roe the necessary resources for the balance ofpayments.5. In these circumstances I am sure that we cannot afford to increase at this late stage direct public spending on goods and services beyond thelevel at which this now stands, and which is reflected both in the SupplyEstimates and in the rate support grant settlement&apos;with the localauthorities.6. I believe we muse secure appreciable extra savings, at least on defence expenditure; and also that we must secure a decision on concorde.    I would hope to refer to decisions on these in my budget speech; and also to Maplin and the Channel Tunnel, although these twoprojects do not greatly affect expenditure in 1974-75.7. The immediate decisions which I am seeking affect only 1974-75but I shall shortly be putting proposals to my colleagues for the reviewof expenditure programmes from 1975-76 onwards, for which it is alsobecoming urgent that we should establish the basis for decisions later inthe year.conclusion. I invite my colleagues -a.    to agree that -i.       net additions to public expenditure for 1974-75should be limited to those affecting personal incomes and expenditure, as indicated in paragraph 2;
ii.       in view of these additional expenditures andthe risk of large additional subsidies being requiredfor the nationalised industries (paragraph 3) we must avoid any other net additions to public expenditure in1974-75;b.    to take note that I shall shortly propose arrangements for preparation of the public expenditure programmes for later years.iiD treasury Chambers12 March 19743
