ANNUAL REVIEW OF AGRICULTURE 1974PART I-introduction. This year&apos;s Annual Review has been carried out on similar lines tothose adopted last year with the aim of ensuring that its conclusions mayform the basis not only for the determination of guaranteed prices for those products which remain within the guarantee system but also for the formu-lation of policy on price-fixing under the Common Agricultural Policy andon other aspects of the Community support system. The main purpose ofthe White Paper is, as it was last year, to set out the main features of theeconomic condition and prospects of the United Kingdom agricultural industry that were considered in the Review. The determinations and related matters have already been announced but, for the sake of completeness, theyare reproduced in Part IV below.2. The agricultural industry has suffered unprecedented increases in costssince the last Annual Review. The world shortages of proteins and cerealsduring the summer and autumn led to rises of about two-thirds in the costs of feedingstuffs. Prices of proteins fell from their peak levels in July but have since tended to increase again, while cereals prices remained highthroughout the Autumn and have risen further since. Other costs, includinglabour, machinery, oil and fertilisers, have gone up significantly and sohave interest rates. On the other hand, farmers&apos; incomes in many sectorshave shown considerable improvement. This has been particularly marked inthe cereals sector but the prices of fat cattle, sheep, poultry and eggs havealso all increased substantially. Milk prices, however, have remained at the levels expected at the time of the determination made after last year&apos;annual Review. The effects of these major changes, both in costs and incomes, have therefore varied markedly between the various sectors of theagricultural industry.3. The Annual Review has had to be conducted in a period of severe ifshort-term difficulties in some parts of farming and against the background ofthe energy crisis and the economic and practical problems that it has causedand may be expected to cause in the coming year. Future policy for agricul-ture must be considered in the light of these problems and of the general economic situation. Continued expansion of efficient food production remains in the national interest and the present short-term difficulties in agriculturemust not be allowed to obscure or vitiate the industry&apos;s excellent long-term prospects.PART II-COMMODITY TRENDSCereals (Tables 1, 4, 6 and 26)4. The cereal acreage harvested in 1973 reached nearly 9.3 million acres and thus fell only marginally below the levels of the two preceding years.Production is expected to total slightly over 15 million tons as a result ofbetter wheat yields than in 1972, although yields of barley and oats were a little down. Prices of both wheat and coarse grains have been at record
levels in 1973/74, reflecting those on the world market arising from the tightsupply situation and the energy shortage. Assuming average weather, thisyear&apos;s wheat and barley yields can be expected to be slightly lower than for 1973, but this effect could be more than offset by a small acreage rise,resulting in somewhat higher production in 1974.Potatoes (Tables 1, 4, 8 and 26)5. In 1973 the potato acreage planted was 24,000 acres below the target of580,000 acres but the average yield was some  -ton per acre higher than in1972. Consumption is expected to increase, but supplies are estimated to be sufficient to meet home requirements. The average market price forthe season is expected to be above the guaranteed price. The 1974 targetacreage has been set at 575,000 acres, little different from the current season.But because of indications that producers might reduce their acreage in1974, the Potato Marketing Board, at the Governmenfs request, have taken action designed to avoid under-planting of the target acreage.Sugar beet (Tables 1, 4, 9 and 26)6. In 1973 the British Sugar Corporation contracted to purchase the beetfrom about 468,000 acres. The yield of sugar is expected to be ho betterthan the average of recent years. However, production has exceeded theUnited Kingdom&apos;s basic quota under Community arrangements (886,000 longtons of refined sugar). Present indications are that the price for beet inexcess of the quota should compare well with that for the basic quota.The British Sugar Corporation has contracted for the produce of about488,000 acres from the 1974 crop. Given a normal yield, production in1974 will again exceed the basic quota.Oilseed rape (Tables 1, 4, 7 and 26)7. Production of oilseed rape increased in 1973 for the third year runningto reach a new record level, although it is still relatively low. Producershave received better prices for this year&apos;s crop as a result of the sharpincreases in world oilseed prices during 1973. A further increase in acreageis expected this year.Hops (Tables 1, 4, 11 and 26)8. The hop acreage continued to decline in 1973, as it has done for someyears, reflecting the improved utilisation of hops in brewing and the trendto varieties with a high alpha-acid content. Yields, however, recovered fromthe low levels of 1972 and production increased accordingly. A furthersmall increase in production is expected in 1974/75. From 1973/74, hopsare being sold on the basis of forward contracts at prices negotiated betweenthe Hops Marketing Board and the brewers.Horticulture (Tables 1, 4, 10 and 26)9. The total cropped area devoted to horticulture in the UK in 1972/73fell slightly compared with the previous year to 713,000 acres. This was mainly due to a reduction in the acreage of field vegetables. There has been
a recovery in this sector in 1973/74 and the estimated total cropped acreageis put at 736,000 acres.10. Apples. The acreage of apple orchards (excluding cider apples) con-tinues its gradual long-term decline and in 1972/73 stood at 92,400 acres.This trend is likely to continue. After a better growing season, output ofboth dessert and culinary apples from the 1973/74 crop recovered from thelow levels of the previous year and yields are expected to be better than average,at 5.0 tons per acre for dessert apples and 5.1 tons per acre for culinaryapples as against 3.5 tons and 4.2 tons respectively in 1972/73. Prices forthe 1973/74 crop are expected to drop back sharply from the abnormallyhigh levels of 1972/73, which were due to short supplies.11. Pears. The fall in the acreage of pear orchards (excluding perry pears)is also expected to continue; in 1972/73 the acreage was 13,500. Yields and output have again been influenced by adverse growing conditions and in they1973/74 crop year are expected to be at their lowest since 1967/68. prices have eased slightly.12. Cauliflowers. The acreage under cauliflowers has been increasingslightly over recent years and is likely to reach about 42,000 acres in 1973/74.Although gross production may well be higher, adverse weather conditions have caused some wastage with the result that output is expected to be slightly down compared to 1972/73. Prices have continued to rise gradually.13. Tomatoes. The tomato acreage remained relatively steady at about,500 acres and yields and output are expected to be higher in 1973/74than in the previous year. Growers&apos; prices have continued the gradual rise of recent years.Herbage seeds (Tables 12 and 26)14. The cropped acreage of certified herbage seed rose again in 1973/74though less steeply than in 1972/73. Production of all herbage seed isexpected to show a broadly similar increase but home production as a percentage of total supply remains at only just over 50%. Prices forthe 1973 harvest seem likely to maintain the steep rise which over the past year has followed the development of a world shortage of herbage seeds.Beef and milk (Tables 1, 4, 13, 14, 15 and 26)15. As expected at the time of last year&apos;s Annual Review, the expansionof the breeding herd continued during 1973. In June 1973 the number ofbreeding cows and heifers in calf was 6% higher than in June-1972;the expansion was most marked for the beef breeding herd, which increasedby 14% over the same period, whilst the dairy herd increased by 3%.16. As a result of increased retentions for breeding and a continued low rate of imports of Irish stores, home production of beef did not increase asexpeoted and, in 1973/74, is likely to be only marginally higher than in1972/73. Market prices of fat cattle declined from the very high levelsreached early in 1973 but remained steady during the second half of the
year. They weakened at the beginning of 1974 and this weakening, togetherwith the higher prices of feed, reduced profitability for those who hadpurchased calves and stores when prices were at their peak in 1973. Asa result, calf and store prices fell back considerably in the autumn. Ahigher level of fat cattle marketings is expected in 1974/75. The level of support provided under the Common Agricultural Policy will increase underthe transitional arrangements.17. The dairy herd continued to expand in the year to June 1973 but from the autumn onwards a cutback in feed utilisation led to a markedfall in yields. As a result, total sales through the Milk Marketing schemes in 1973/74 are expected to be no higher than the level of 1972/73. Thislevelling-out reflects the difficult circumstances arising, in particular, fromthe continuing increase in feedingstuffs prices throughout 1973. After the1973 Annual Review the guaranteed price was raised by l p per gallon.In addition, the e.c. market intervention arrangements, which have nowbeen operating in the United Kingdom for a full year, contributed to afurther substantial increase in the manufacturing price realised by the milk marketing Boards for milk outside the standard quantity. The average poolprice in 1973/74 is accordingly expected to be substantially higher than in1972/73. The rising cost of feedingstuffs, fertilisers and other inputs stillpresents problems to producers and the outlook for 1974/75 is consequentlyuncertain, but the long-term trends towards improved yields and increased production are expected to reassert themselves.Sheep and wool (Tables 1, 13, 17 and 26)18. The breeding flock has continued to expand; by December 1973, itwas estimated to have increased by some 2% compared with theprevious year. This seems likely to produce an increase of 6% in home-fed lamb production in 1973/74 compared with 1972/73 and, assumingnormal lambing conditions, some further expansion in 1974/75. Total lambsupplies in 1973/74 are, however, expected to fall, mainly because of a shortfall  of nearly 60,000 tons in imported supplies. Consequently, market prices in 1973/74 have increased significantly compared with 1972/73 andhave remained well above the guaranteed price.19. Production of fleece wool again increased in 1973. Auction prices forthe 1973 clip showed an increase compared with the previous year&apos;s clip,although not of the magnitude that occurred between 1971 and 1972. It isexpected that the average auction price for 1973/74 will be above the guaranteed price.Pigs (Tables 1, 13 and 26)20. The expansion of the UK breeding herd which began in early 1972continued in 1973, although the rate of expansion has been checked recently,primarily by the high costs of feed. Nevertheless, in 1973/74 as a whole, thecontinued increase in supplies of pigmeat for pork and manufacture hasbeen only partly offset by a decline in supplies for bacon, so that supplies ofpigmeat for home consumption should show some rise. Pig prices remainedvery firm in 1973 and had risen during the year by over  1 per score
deadweight by November; the average market price for 1973/74 is forecast to be considerably above the guaranteed price, although pig prices easedsomewhat from early December and have since remained at a lower level.poultry meat (Tables 1, 13 and 26)21. Production of poultry meat continued to increase in 1972/73 andfurther rises are expected in 1973/74 and 1974/75. Retail prices throughout1973 remained very firm, largely due to the continued upward trend inmeat prices generally. As a result, average wholesale prices over 1973/74 asa whole are expected to be considerably higher than in 1972/73. Turkeysagain increased their share of the market, with prices about 20% higherthan in 1972/73.Eggs (Tables 1, 4, 16 and 26)22. The size of the average laying flock over 1973/74 is expected to beabout 2% lower than.....in 1972/73 and this, combined with a fall inyields per bird, is expected to lead to a fall in production of about 4%.The average producer price (including subsidy) is likely to be about15p per dozen higher than in 1972/73, when-returns were very low. Anincrease in the level of production is forecast for 1974/75.PART HI GENERAL DEVELOPMENTSFarm structure (Table 2)23. The number of farms in the United Kingdom continues to decline.The total number of significant units and the number of full-time farms,at 280,000 and 178,000 in 1973, are respectively some 13% and 9%lower than in 1968. The fall in numbers has been most markedamong the part-time and smaller full-time farms. Businesses capable ofproviding full-time work for at least one man account for nearly 94 percent of total output, though in Northern Ireland and Wales the output ofsmall part-time farms is rather more significant than in other parts of theUnited Kingdom. About one-third of holdings have businesses capable ofproviding work for at least two men (ie those of 600 standard man-days ormore), but they account for over three-quarters of total output, while largebusinesses (1,200 standard man-days or more) though only 14% of the totalnumber produce rather more than a half of total output.24. The average size of farms is increasing. Full-time businesses averaged234 acres (including rough grazings) in 1973 compared with 216 acres in1968. The average size of unit in the various enterprises, eg cereal acreage,dairy herd, beef breeding herd, is also expanding as the trend to greaterspecialisation continues.Index of net product (Table 18)25. For 1972/73 the index is now put at 118 (average of 1964/65-1966/67= 100) instead of 117 as previously estimated. For 1973/74 it is forecast torise to 121. A similar trend is shown by the rebased index. Compared with1972/73, greater output of cereals (mostly wheat), sugar beet, horticultureand livestock is forecast for 1973/74, but these increases are expected to be
partly offset by falls in the output of potatoes, milk and eggs. On the inputside, purchases of feed and fertilisers are expected to be higher.Efficiency and labour productivity (Tables 3 and 18)26. The annual rate of gain in the efficiency of the industry is now put at about  75 million, taking one year with another. This figure relates to thewhole of agricultural production.27. The latest estimates indicate an average annual rate of increase in labour productivity (the volume of gross product per head) of about 6%for the period 1964/65 to 1973/74. The outflow of regular whole-timeworkers was running at about 5% in the late 1960s but in recent years hasbeen at lower rates.Net income of the industry (Tables 18, 20 and 23)28. Information on farm incomes has, as usual, been derived from a sample of farm accounts. The figures for 1972/73 indicate that in Englandand Wales average income for all types of full-time farm (excluding horticulture-culture) was about 36% higher than in 1971/72. This increase in average income reflects a rise in the value of total output of about 17%.It has been brought about by higher market prices for most guaranteedcommodities, a good barley harvest, higher prices for store stock, and biggerdairy herds and ewe flocks. Part of the increase is attributable to a marked increase in the end-of-year valuations of crops and stock. Net income was higher on all types and sizes of farms and there was less variation than usual; only some sizes of dairy and cropping farms in the central and southern areas of England did rather less well. In Scotland average net income rose by 58%. Hill sheep and dairying had below average increases of 37% while net income on arable farms generally was up by 75-100%.In Northern Ireland there was the substantial increase in 1972/73 which great Britain had experienced in 1971/72. On average, income rose by 89%;cattle and sheep farms did best but all types and sizes benefited.29. The aggregate net income of the industry rose in 1972/73 to  832million, an increase over 1971/72 of  151 million. A further large rise of 392 million is forecast for 1973/74. Adjusted for normal weather, incomebetween the two years is estimated to have increased from  790 million in1972/73 to  1,172 million in 1973/74.30. In real terms, aggregate net income shows an upward trend and is forecast to rise by some 35% in 1973/74. Over the last nine years, realincome per full-time farm has almost doubled, with most of this increasehaving taken place in the last four years. These are substantial increasesbut they need qualification in three respects. First, farm income is not directlycomparabb with incomes in most other sectors of the economy, since it includes elements of wages and changes in stock valuations as well asprofits. It provides the return to farmers and their wives for their manualand managerial labour. It also provides the return on occupiers&apos; investment in the farm business. Tenants&apos; valuations have risen by some  473 millionbut of this increase as much as  390 million is due to higher input costs.g
Excluding this element in net farm income, fanners&apos; net returns are estimated to have risen by around 22% in money terms in 1973/74 and by around 11%in real terms. Secondly, the aggregate figures cover wide differences betweensectors, showing a developing imbalance in the industry. Incomes on manycropping farms were at a very high level, reflecting the high world cereal and sugar prices. But livestock producers suffered from the high feed and other costs. While some of these producers received compensating benefits fromhigher market prices, others did not and dairy and, to a lesser extent, pigproducers suffered significant cuts in margins. Thirdly, the year&apos;s figures for livestock producers cover very marked variations ini incomes over the courseof the year. Most livestock producers received good incomes in the early part of the year, but, as costs rose in later months, margins were reduced and this trend seems likely to continue.Cost changes (Table 25)31. Cost increases since the last Review are assessed at  712 million for all products, the chief items being  434 million in feed costs (includingthe cost increase of some  68J million referred to in paragraph 36 of the1973 Annual Review White Paper),  82 million in -the costs of labour,  62million in machinery cost and  23 million in interest charges. These figuresfor cost changes do not allow for changes in the volume of resources, includ-ing labour, used by the industry. These figures were calculated beforethe period of notification to the Price Commission of some proposed price increases for feedingstuffs, fertilisers and oil in January and February hadbeen completed. In a full year, these additional increases would representaggregate cost increases of  90 million,  25 million and  38 million respectively.Gross capital formation (Table 22)32. A marked increase in the value of investment is revealed by theprovisional figures for 1973. Gross capital formation in landlord and tenant-type physical assets together is estimated to have reached  789 million inthe calendar year 1973, an increase of nearly 50% over 1972. Of this invest-ment,  213 million (an increase of 34%) was in buildings and works,  219million was in plant, machinery and vehicles (an increase of 14%), and 357 million was for additions to works in progress. Expressed in real terms,investment in buildings and works is expeoted to be some 10% higher in1973 than in 1972 and that in plant, machinery and vehicles to be at aboutthe same level as in the previous year.Agricultural land prices33. During the period 1969 to 1971, the price of agricultural land remain-ing in farming in the United Kingdom showed little change, but in 1972and the first half of 1973 prices rose sharply and in many areas more than doubled. Thus in England and Wales the average price of all sales of over10 acres recorded in the Inland Revenue series rose from about  200 inthe period 1969 to 1971 to over  500 in the latest six months ended30 September 1973. Moreover, because of the delay between a price being agreed and its notification to the Inland Revenue, some further increase
in this series is likely. Current reports, however, suggest that land valuesmay now be stabilising.Rents (Table 21)34. During Stage II of the Counter-Inflation Programme, agricultural rentswere frozen except that rent increases were allowable for improvements(buildings and works etc.) carried out by landlords. Consequently the increasein rents of 4.5% in Great Britain was substantially less than the averageof 6-7% for most recent years.Farm workers&apos; earnings (Table 19)35. The minimum wage for regular adult male workers was raised by 3.30 per week with effect from 1 April 1973 (although the figure in Scotland was  3.10). This increase is reflected in part in the average earnings of 26.42 per week for the year ended. September 1973. A further increaseof  2.30 per week took effect on 22 January 1974.Public expenditure (Table 24)36. The estimated outturn for expenditure on United Kingdom price guarantees, grants and subsidies in 1973/74 is about  309 million. the comparable outturn for 1972/73 was  267 million. Increased expenditureon the milk guarantee and on the capital grants has been partly offset bya reduction in the fertiliser subsidy together with reduced expenditure on other price guarantees as a result of high market prices.37. Expenditure under the common market organisations of the EECis estimated to rise to about  102 million in 1973/74 compared with lessthan  1 million in 1972/73. Of this, about  83 million is likely to bereceived from FEOGA (the European Agricultural Guidance and guarantee fund). This expenditure by the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produceis made up of several elements. These include the net cost of commoditiesbought into intervention and subsequently sold, the gross cost of incentivesfor private storage or denaturing, consumer subsidies on butter, exportrefunds on third country trade, and import refunds in respect of intra-community trade (monetary compensatory amounts).

As announced on 21 March 1973, the sugar beet guarantee arrange-ments will be terminated on 30 June 1974, and Ministers will not thereforebe making a Direction under section 17 of the Sugar Act 1956 in respectof the 1974 crop.Fat sheep40. The end-of-year payment arrangement, which provides for a specialpayment to producers to make up any shortfall in the guarantee payments,will be terminated at the end of the 1973/74 fatstock year.41. The arrangements whereby the weekly estimated prices are adjustedif the average market price realised falls short of the estimated price in anyweek by more than 2^p per lb estimated dressed carcase weight will alsobe terminated at the end of the 1973/74 fatstock year.
42. Discussions are taking place on proposals to streamline the FatstockGuarantee Scheme procedures when market prices for sheep are well abovethe guaranteed price.Fat pigs43. Discussions are taking place on proposals to streamline the FatstockGuarantee Scheme procedures when market prices for fat pigs are wellabove the guaranteed price. A new price reporting system which is being set up will enable the course of market prices to be kept under surveillance.Milk44. The guaranteed price and the standard quantity for the UnitedKingdom will be as follows:1973/74April 1973-February 1974March 1974      ......1974/75 (April-March year)guaranteed price(pence per gallon)24.6126.2726.27Standardquantity(million gallons)2,743.52,900The guarantee arrangements for 1973/74 have been varied so as to apply the 1974/75 increase from 1 March and to provide the funds necessaryto enable the Milk Marketing Boards to make an immediate payment.Eggs45. Under the terms of Section 23 of the Agriculture Act 1970, the guarantees for hen and duck eggs will be terminated on 30 March 1974.Production grants46. The lime subsidy will be terminated on 31 July 1974.47. The fertiliser subsidy will be terminated at the end of the currentScheme year on 31 May 1974.48. Lime and fertiliser deliveries made after 31 July and 31 May 1974,respectively, will not qualify for subsidy payment.Capital grants49. Discussions are taking place with a view to basing the &quot;sufficientlivelihood&quot; test for eligibility for capital grants on average agricultural eam-ings instead of on the statutory minimum agricultural wage. This will raisethe test from the present figure for Great Britain of  1,150 to about  1,600,with correspondingly lower figures for Northern Ireland. It is proposed tomake this change on 1 May 1974.50. Discussions are taking place with a view to increasing the minimumqualifying level of expenditure from the present figure of  100 to  250. Itis proposed to make this change on 1 May 1974.
wAPPENDIXStatistical TablesBecause substantial changes were made in the number, format and content of the statisticaltables in last year&apos;s White Paper, care should be taken when using these tables in conjunctionwith those in earlier White Papers. In addition, some of the figures in this appendix differ fromthose in previous Annual Review White Papers because of later information, changes in thescope and nature of the available data and improvements in statistical methods. Forecasts for1973/74 are as at mid-December 1973.All figures relate to the United Kingdom un!ess&quot;otherwise stated.Figures for imports from and exports to the Eight relate throughout to the countries of the enlarged e.c. (Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, the Irish Republic, Italy, Lux-embourg and the Netherlands). These figures also include supplies to and from the channel islands. (Significant items of Channel Islands trade are shown separately in footnotes.)Figures for exports include re-exports.Figures for total supplies take no account of changes in opening and closing stocks, whichcan considerably affect net off take for consumption.In some cases figures may not add to the totals shown because of roundings.Symbols:  means &quot;;nil&quot;... means &quot;negligible&quot; (less than half the last digit shown).. means &quot;&apos;not available&quot;

(a) Up to 1969, the figures for Great Britain relate to agricultural holdings exceeding one acre in extent, but in June,1968, about 47,000 holdings were excluded from the census in England and Wales on the grounds that they werenot statistically significant. In Scotland, 16,000 holdings were excluded on the same grounds with effect from june, 1970.Up to 1972, figures for Northern Ireland relate to holdings of one acre or more, except for numbers of livestock,which were collected from all owners, irrespective of the size of the holding, and also from landless stockholders.From June, 1973, some 8,000 statistically insignificant holdings were excluded from the census.The exclusion of these statistically insignificant holdings has not affected the cropping and stocking figures forthe United Kingdom to any significant extent.Between June, 1969, and June, 1970, some 10,000 holdings in England and Wales were &quot;statistically amal-gamated&quot;. These holdings, farmed with other holdings as part of a larger single farm unit, were formerly re-turned separately but are now returned as part of the larger unit.The definition of agricultural holdings has been widened to include, as from June, 1970, some 2,300 statisticallysignificant holdings on one acre or less of agricultural land in Great Britain and, as from June, 1973, about 2,000statistically significant but landless stock-holdings in Northern Ireland. The cropping and stocking figures returnedby holdings on one acre or less in Great Britain account for significant differences between the June, 1970,censusresults and those for previous years only in the case of pigs and fowls (see figures in square brackets in the table).From June, 1973, the threshold of significance in Great Britain was raised from 26 to 40 standard man-days (a standard man-day (smd) represents 8 hours productive work by an adult male worker under average conditions),excluding from the census a further 8,000 or so holdings on about 185,000 acres of land, mostly permanent grassand rough grazing. The net result of this change, together with the elimination of 6,000 or so holdings inNorthern Ireland, has been to exclude some 14,000 holdings on about 225,000 acres of land in the UnitedKingdom.The UK figures now relate to all known holdings with 40 smd or more; in England and Wales and NorthernIreland holdings with less than 40 smd are included only if they have 10 acres or more of crops and grass or atleast one regular whole-time worker.(6) For threshing.(r) Includes small area of soft fruit grown under orchard trees in England and Wales,(a-) Hardy nursery stock, bulbs and flowers.(e) Most of the difference between total horticultural area and the sum of individual sectors is made up by theglasshouse area.(/) Includes acreages of other crops and bare fallow not shown in the table. ,(g) Includes lucerne.(A) Includes common rough grazings. The fall of about 1 million acres in the area of rough grazings between 1969and 1970 is largely accounted for by the exclusion from the census of the 16,000 statistically insignificant hold-ings in Scotland referred to in note (o).0) &quot;Other land&quot; in Great Britain means woodland and areas under roads, yards, buildings etc., the use of which isancillary to the farming of the land; in Northern Ireland it includes land within agricultural holdings which isunder bog, water, roads, buildings etc., and waste land not used for agriculture. Returns of &quot;other land&quot; were collected for the first time in England and Wales in June, 1969, and the area returned then (208,000 acres)is understated. It is estimated that the figures quoted include not less than 149,000 acres previously returned ascrops and grass or rough grazing.(k) Figures for years earlier than 1964 are for fowls six months old and over in Great Britain and five months oldand over in Northern Ireland.(0   Corrected figure.Table 2 - Notes.(a) To preserve comparability between the two years, the figures for 1968 have been adjusted to take account of the exclusion from the census in 1970 of 16,000 holdings classified as statistically insignificant.Further adjustments to the 1968 figures have been made to the first two sections of the table - relating to crops and grass and to the size of business - to take account of the extension of the threshold of significance from 26to 40 smd in Great Britain; in Northern Ireland the figures for both years relate only to holdings with 50 smdor more. These changes would have only a marginal effect on the data given in the enterprise analyses.There are still some discontinuities in the figures resulting from other changes made between 1968 and 1973(for details see footnote (a) to Table 1), but they have not significantly affected the trend in the average size ofenterprise.(A) These figures include holdings with no crops and grass acreage which are excluded from the first section of this table.(c) 250 smd in Scotland; 200 smd in Northern Ireland.id) Includes an estimate of upwards of 15,000 full-time farms which have under 275 smd (or equivalent) based ontheir cropping and stocking and assuming average labour usage. Adjustments have been made for holdingswhich, though run as separate farming units, are in the same occupancy.(e) Includes maize for threshing in 1973 - not collected separately in 1968.(/) England and Wales only.(g) Figures included for Scotland and Northern Ireland relate to the December censuses in 1967 and 1972.(A) Figures included for Scotland relate to the December censuses in 1967 and 1972.

They include some estimates for figures not directlyobtainable from the Scottish census results and for that reason they differ slightly from some of the publishedUnited Kingdom census results, Because of changes in the census categories in England and Wales in 1970 and1972 numbers returned for earlier years are not available on the same basis as those for the most recent years.The figures do not include the wives of farmers, partners and directors, even though the wives themselves may bepartners or directors.(6) Includes workers returned as &quot;seasonal or casual&quot;.(c) Based on a count of national insurance cards at June and the Population Census. Because of differences incoverage and time of collection the figures are not on the same basis as those returned in the June agriculturalcensus. This series was discontinued after June, 1971, and was replaced in 1972 by an annual Census ofEmployment to which the agricultural census contributes.(d) The increase in farmers, partners and directors is probably due to an understatement of this category in Englandand Wales at June, 1970, when farmers etc. were included in the census for the first time.(e) Not separately returned between 1970 and 1972; Great Britain only.Number of persons engaged in agriculture (a)

The esti-mates of aggregate net income include a profit in recent years of about  5 million on the produc-tion of food for consumption in the farm household. In other industries the corresponding sumsare not treated as profit and are relatively much smaller (in many cases non-existent). These figures are not directly comparable with incomes in other sectors of the economy since farm incomealso includes elements of wages and changes in stock valuations as well as profits. (See paragraph30 of Part II.)(b) This is net income at current prices, adjusted for those changes in works-in-progress and stocks which areascribable to changes in costs,(c) Net Product (Net Output) measures year-to-year changes in the value-added at constant prices by farmers,landowners and farmworkers, to all the goods and services purchased from outside the agricultural sector.(d) Labour productivity is here defined as gross product per person engaged in agriculture. Gross product is grossoutput less all inputs other than depreciation, labour, net rent and interest. It is here measured at constant prices.In order to be consistent with national economic conventions, gross product as used in the calculation of labour productivity covers agricultural contractors as well as all commercially significant holdings. The total numberof persons engaged in agriculture comprises the number of employees, employers and self-employed recorded in the annual June census taken by the Agricultural Departments. Prior to 1971, however, the trends in numbersof employers and employees were estimated respectively from the Population Censuses and the Department ofEmployment count of national insurance cards.O) A new series using a more up-to-date base has been added this year.Table 19Average earnings and hours of agricultural workers (a)Years ended September	1969	1970	1971	1972	1973Earnings   per week (b) Hours per week (c)    ......	16-74 48-5	18-14 47-9	20-25 47-3	22-60 47-2	26-42 47-6(a) For all hired men.(b) Earnings include pay for statutory holidays and payments-in-kind which are valued at rates set down by theAgricultural Wages; Boards and comprise houses, milk, potatoes, etc. (the principal one being houses mostof which were in England and Wales valued at 30p prior to 17 January, 1972, and 50p thereafter).(c) All hours worked and statutory holidays.

In practice, however,there are many variations in the division between the two responsibilities. Investment in plant and machinery is normally tenant-type. Investment in buildings and works is normally landlord-type.The figures in the table represent gross expenditure before crediting any grants which reduce the cost to the owneror occupier.

They are weighted averages based on census distribution of agricultural holdingsby type of farming and size of business. More detailed figures for England and Wales will be published in&quot;Farm Incomes in England and Wales 1972/73&quot;, for Scotland in &quot;Scottish Agricultural Economics 1974 ,for Northern Ireland in &quot;The Northern Ireland Farm Management Survey 1972/73&quot;, and for Wales m the&quot;Supplement to the Annual Digest of Welsh Statistics 1972/73&quot;.Net income is defined as for the aggregate net income calculation (Tables 18 and 20), except that here net income is calculated before deduction of interest on any commercial debt. All farms are treated as rented andan imputed rental value is charged as an expense in the accounts of owner-occupiers.The accounts relate in the main to calendar years or to the year ending 5 April: the average year-ending date is about mid-February.(6) Includes &quot;mixed&quot; farm type.(c) Almost all farm businesses in Northern Ireland are based on owner-occupied holdings. As rents cannot beimputed with reference to tenanted farms, the rental charges entered for owned land and buildings have been assessed in relation to estimated sale value. Where land was taken in conacre, the actual rents paid have been included. A high proportion of the labour on farms is family labour and the charge for this has been calculatedfor estimated hours worked. For these reasons the average net incomes per farm are not on the same basis asthose for Great Britain.(d) Includes &quot;cattle, sheep and pigs&quot;, &quot;pigs and poultry&quot; and &quot;cropping&quot; farm types.

It also includes estimates of support under the CAP in theform of expenditure by the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce, although some of the Board&apos;s paymentsgo to processors or producers in other parts of the Community, while U.K. receipts from correspondingagencies in the remainder of the Community are not included. It excludes expenditure which may benefitfarmers but where the value to them is not shown by the expenditure (e.g. expenditure on animal disease andpest control or on research, advice and education).The figures for years up to and including 1972/73 represent actual expenditure recorded in the AppropriationAccounts. The figures for 1973/74 are the latest estimates of expenditure. The figures for 1974/75 are provisional and are subject to Parliamentary approval of the Estimates, they take account of the decision to end the limeF    and fertiliser subsidies,(6) Payments in respect of cereals, wool and potatoes relate partly to the crops or clip of the year indicated andpartly to the crops and clips in the preceding year or years. The figures shown in brackets represent repayments of surpluses under the British Wool Marketing Schemes.(c) The cost of implementing the milk guarantee to producers reflects the Governments policy of holding the retail price of milk at the 1971 level.(d) Includes grants in respect of investment on self-propelled machines (agricultural and horticultural), co-operation and credit, small horticultural production businesses, small farmers and farm business records.(e) Farmers in special areas are also eligible for higher rates of grant under the Farm Capital Grant Scheme(see Section II). The additional benefit in 1974/75 is assessed at about  3-4 million.(/) Includes grants for improvement of hill land and livestock rearing land, rural roads, producers in the ScottishIslands and crofting improvements.(g) The figures shown are total expenditure before allowing for receipts from FEOGA (the European AgriculturalGuidance and Guarantee Fund), and consist of the costs of the Intervention Board for Agricultural produce in implementing the CAP system. They are made up of several elements and include the net cost of commoditiesbought into intervention and subsequently sold, the gross cost of incentives for private storage or denaturing,consumer subsidies on butter, export refunds on third country trade and import refunds in respect of intra-Community trade (monetary compensatory amounts). In relation to intervention buying operations they allow for the value of sales out of intervention but include the change in the value of stocks bought but unsold at theend of each financial year.(Jt) Includes eggs, poultry meat, fruit and vegetables, oilseeds, hops, seeds and fisheries.
