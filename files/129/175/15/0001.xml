DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 15 COPY NO20 March 1974CABINET&quot;     CONCORDENote by the Secretary of State for IndustryIn their consideration of my paper on Concorde (C(74) 10) to be taken atthis Thursday&apos;s Cabinet my colleagues may find it useful to have theattached note of the statement I made in the House on Monday, togetherwith the statement of salient facts that was referred to in my speech.A W BDepartment of Industry20 March 1974
STATEMENT ON CONCORDEBY MR TONY ESNN, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR industry i will, with permission, make a statement on Concorde.    immediately on taking office, I asked my Department to report to me on the currentposition and prospects.Successive Governments have &quot;been criticised in the past forrevealing too little information.I;I am, therefore, circulating in the Official Report, -and havemade available in the Library and the Vote Office now, a detailed statement of the salient facts available to me so that the House can be properly informed of the position.I can summarise the position quite simply.      , -Concorde is the only commercial supersonic aircraft on offer inthe Western world and everyone recognises its technical achievement.Two prototype, two pre-production and the first two production aircraft have flown successfully.The production of 16 aircraft has been authorised.British Airways and Air France have ordered 9 of these.Certification is now expected in the latter part of 1975.British Airways should have 3 aircraft in April 1976 with which to begin scheduled services.The latest total estimate of the joint development cost for theexisting version of the aircraft is  1070M-of which a further  130Mremains to be spent by the UK both figures at January 197U prices  None of these development costs will be recovered.Continued/.*
British Airways estimate that the operation of Concorde couldsubstantially worsen their financial results, possibly by many millions of pounds a year. , .. :.With regard to noise, the landing and take off noise levels are -expected to be comparable to those of such existing aircraft as the VC10and Boeing 707, but significantly higher than those imposed on new&apos;subsonic aircraft.It is as yet uncertain whether the aircraft will prove acceptableat New York (Kennedy), Tokyo or Sydney,,Against this background the manufactiirers have proposed a seriesof measures to reduce engine noise levels and increase the range by thedevelopment of extra fuel tanks, -an   improved engine, and the re-design of-the wing.    They estimate the total cost to the two countries of this additional development at  167M at July 1973 prices v But it would be prudent to assume a figure of  220M at January 197U- prices.,    The UK shareof this would be additional to the  130M which I referred to earlier.The manufacturers estimate that passenger demand by the early 1980swould be sufficient to sustain 130 Goncordes in service on the assumptionthat their version of the aircraft with these proposed modifications will&quot;be introduced.The Government has to consider how far this estimate takes adequateaccount of certain important factors, the effect of which could be toreduce sales substantially.   These factors are more fully set out in the detailed statement,,On varying assumptions made by the Government of the selling price for Concordes - both basic and developed - of between ^i+O^M and $4-7-the price would not be sufficient to cover the cost of their productionand of the necessary market support measures.   These measures could wellamount to 10 to 20 per cent of the selling price.By way of illustration, in addition to the loss of all development expenditure, the UK share of production losses, at January 197U prices,over a range of sales, none^of which can be safely assumed, could be asfollows: ;On 16 Concordes  200M to  225M could be lost;
On 35 Concordes  260M to  300M;On 100 Concordes  1.20M to  250M.The French Government announced on 19 February that they would propose the production of 3 more aircraft and they would hot be opposedto the introduction of a limited modification involving increased fuelcapacity,,   They stated that they &quot;put a^ide the development of an improveengine and wing.&quot;In view of the size of the sums of public expenditure involved and the.importance of the decisions that must now be made,&apos;I thought it right to place all these facts before the House and the country before any decisions are reached. -    -I have already proposed an early meeting with my French Ministerialcolleague.,     iMarch 18 197U

The manufacturers, British Aircraft Corporation, SNIAS, (Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale), Rolls-Royce(1971) and SNECMA (societe Nationale d&apos;Etude et de Constructionde Moteurs d* Aviation) expect to achieve a Certificate of airworthiness for passenger services between June-August 1975ybut officials consider that it would be prudent to assume thatcertification will not take place before the end of 1975*   Thethree aircraft which British Airways need to start services are expected to be delivered by April 1976o(b) The landing and take off noise levels of the production aircraft are expected to be comparable to those of suchexisting aircraft as the VC10 and Boeing 707, but significantlyhigher than those now imposed on new subsonic aircraft and being considered for supersonic transports by the USregulatory authorities.(c) Supersonic overland corridors for services to Tokyo and Sydneyhave still to be arranged over the Soviet Union, the middle east, India, Indonesia and Australia but no objections inprinciple have been voiced.   A one-stop service to South africa is not possible because no suitable runway exists.    It is as yet uncertain whether the aircraft will prove acceptable at new York (Kennedy), Tokyo or Sydney on noise groundse
2o &apos;(d)     British Airways estimate that the operation of Concorde, could       substantially wo*rsen their financial results, possible by many millions of pounds a year.EmploymentConcorde supports up to 21,000 Jobsjf 9*000 of these are in Bristol,orae 3,500: in Weybridge, and the rest distributed among sub-contractingompanies and materials suppliers throughout the country.,     The Manuf acturers1 Proposals ;The manufacturers&apos; proposals are as follows:-&quot;&quot;(a)     Development:    in ord..r to reduce noisejiand increase range, theintroduction of (i) extra fu,el tanks and Some we-ight savingmodifications, (ii) an improved engine, and (iii) an improved wingdesign.   The manufacturers consider that all these lines ofdevelopment should be pursued, for incorporation in a new version atthe 15th product ion aircraft.   They estimate that these&apos;developmentswill be completed by mid-1978, and costs would total  167M at July1973 prices.(b)     Production:    a programme rising to 16 aircraft a year and producing 60 aircraft by end of 198i.   The manufacturers estimate that passenger demand by the early 1980s would be sufficient to sustain 130 Concord.es in service on the assumption that the improvedversion of the aircraft will be -introduced.IgjcmentB on Manufacturers&apos; Proposals.     The Government considers that:-(a)     the development proposals appear technically feasible but arelikely to take longer than forecast by the manufacturers, andto cost  220M at January 197h prices rather than  1-67M at July1973 prices;------&apos; .   x^kj)Continued/....,
(b) the manufacturers5, market estimates may take inadequateaccount of the effects of noise and pollution restrictions,the effect of improved versions of existing jets, and theeffects of   both   the temporary shortage of fuel and theincrease in fuel prices on traffic growth, operating economicsand airline purchasing policies.    It is difficult to assess howffar any part of the manufacturers&apos;  estimates of passenger demand will &quot;be translated into actual! sales of the improved version, butthe effects of the above factors could be to reduce salessubstantially.it(c) on varying assumptions made by the Government of the selling price for Concordes - both basic and developed - of between/$UO^-M and $Li7?M, the price would not be sufficient to cover thecost of their production and of the necessary, market support ..measures.   These measures might well amount to 10 to 20 per cent of the selling price.   By way of illustration, the UK share ofproduction losses at .January 197^- prices over a range of sales,hone of which can be safely assumed, could be.-On 16 Concordes  20011 to  225MOn 35 Concordes  260M to  300MOn 100 Concordes  120M to  250M(d) accordingly, none of the development costs either for theexisting programme or for any further improvements would be recovered.-     * *Financial ImplicationsOn the following assumptions, the net cost to public funds from to 11978 of the UK share of the programme, excluding allrest on capital employed, and any operating losses sustained byish Airways, is estimated at January ^97k^ prices to be:-  MILLIONCease production now (allowance forcontractual costs, redundancy and unemployment payments) 80 80
