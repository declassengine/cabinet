DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 22 COPY NO      783 April 1974CABINETBUILDING SOCIETIESMemorandum by the Central Policy Review staff. The note attached to the Secretary of State for the Environmentspaper on the building societies (C(74) 20) sets out the dilemma facingMinisters.    The building societies wish to put their investment rate up to per cent net and hence their mortgage rate to 13 per cent gross in orderto stem the outflow of funds and achieve the net inflow which is needed ifthe house building programme and confidence in the building societies isnot to collapse.    Should Ministers let the building societies put up their rates or should they step in with some form of subsidy so as to ensurethat the mortgage rate is maintained at 11 per cent?The case for accepting some increase in the mortgage rate is:a. The need to keep public expenditure down.b. Holders of mortgages are in general not the most needymembers of society.    Those who have owned a house for morethan 3 or 4 years could afford to make higher mortgage payments and are probably sitting on substantial capital gains.c. After deducting tax relief and the rate of inflation even a mortgage rate of 13 per cent is a negative interest rate.The case for stopping any increase is:a.        Not stopping the increase will be another major blow to the attempts to curb inflation.b*        The fact that the mortgage rate would have risen from8j per cent to 13 per cent, ie, by more than 50 per cent in 12 months,would hit very badly those people who had taken out large mortgagesto buy houses at the high prices prevailing in the last two or threeyears.The Central Policy Review Staff (CPRSJ believes that, in the longer term,there is a strong economic and social justice case for the realignment ofbuilding society deposit rates with those paid by the societies competitors.This cannot be done immediately, but a start might be made by allowing the investment rate to rise to 9 per cent net and the mortgage rate to1
12 per cent gross.    This would need to be accompanied by a subsidyequivalent to another 1 per cent on the mortgage rate,  150 million ayear.    The subsidy should be on a temporary basis.    But there is animportant political dimension to this problem, to which the Secretary ofState draws attention, but which the CPRS is not competent to judge.2. The Secretary of State says in his paper that &quot;we must try andease matters by getting funds for the building societies from, forexample, the Eurodollar market&quot;.    The CPRS agrees with this view.It believes that it should be possible to obtain funds from the Eurodollarmarket, the banks (at a rate similar to that paid to other building society depositors if enough pressure is put on the banks) and through are-discounting facility.    There are, of course, problems with all theseapproaches, but they are surmountable,    Indeed had these proposals been implemented earlier it would no doubt have been possible already to have obtained additional funds for the Building Societies from these sources andthus have relieved the current very serious situation.3. One of the problems will be to overcome the apprehension of theBuilding Societies about novel ways of raising additional funds.    their first reaction in early March to a proposal by a bank to raise $500 million in the Eurodollar market was that it was &quot;premature&quot;.    Their reaction to a revised proposal submitted last week remains very guarded and notwhat one would expect from institutions urgently looking for funds.    the cprs believes that if Ministers are prepared to help the Building Societieswith a subsidy they will be well placed to exert strong pressure on theBuilding Societies to help themselves to the maximum possible extent,e. g. by trying to raise money in the Eurodollar market.4. One way of increasing pressure on the Building Societies to followpolicies of enlightened self-interest would be to include in the terms ofreference of the high-powered Committee proposed by the Secretary ofState a review of the future of the Building Societies.    While the societies   have made a valuable contribution to home ownership in thepast, it is less clear whether they are making the optimum contributiontoday, let alone that they will do so in the future unless they develop muchmore flexible attitudes.    At the minimum there would seem to be room for a considerable degree of rationalisation of the number of societies andtheir activities and a greater willingness to adapt to change.    The studycould also cover the question of a greater degree of Government controlover building societies.5. The CPRS recommends that Ministers should:-a.      endorse in principle that Building Societies should be activelyencouraged to raise new funds from the Eurodollar market, the-banks and the institutions,   and instruct officials to work out withthe societies the details as a matter of urgency;2
b.      set up a high powered Committee to consider the questionof home ownership and private sector housing which inter aliawould consider the future of the Building Societies.Cabinet Office3 April 1974//3
