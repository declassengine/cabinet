US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 512 March 1974PRICES policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection1.        Early legislation is needed to fulfil our undertakings to introducestricter price controls, to make selective use of subsidies for items which are significant in the family budget, to improve price marking andto require unit pricing.2. The price control system can also be improved by interim amend-ments to the existing Price Code and to the associated Orders.    I intend to make urgent progress on all these heads.legislation. The Price Commission should continue to operate as an independentagency to control prices in accordance with a general Price Code.7^COPY NO    8CABINET4.        I seek the agreement of my colleagues to the urgent preparationof a Bill to cover a. authority for expenditure on subsidies; ?b. power for Ministers, by Order, to prescribe prices andmargins in relation to subsidised goods;c. power for Ministers, by Order, to prescribe prices andmargins of other specified foods;d. a power to vary decisions of the Price Commission;e. power for Ministers, by Order, to require prices to bedisplayed and goods to be marked with unit prices.5. The Bill might also deal with the abolition of the Pay Board and theunscrambling of the system established by the Counter-Inflation Act 1973so that controls on prices, dividends and rents can continue without a pay code and without statutory pay controls;  this will be the subject of separate proposals.
6.        Specific statutory cover is required for expenditure on subsidies onthe scale we have in mind.7. Our Manifesto promised subsidies of items &quot;bearing most heavily on the family budget&quot; and did not, in terms, limit this undertaking tofoodstuffs.    I have in mind payment of subsidies on a short list of selectedfoodstuffs (say milk, butter, cheese, sugar and bread).8.        If the milk subsidy continues to be dealt with separately, I suggestthat the power should be for one  year and limited to  500 million.    It isfor consideration whether there should be a power to increase this sum byOrder,    Our conclusion may depend on whether we expect to have to act onitems outside the food field (eg on electricity).PRICES AND MARGINS9. Powers will certainly be needed to set prescribed prices and marginsat any stage of distribution for subsidised commodities.    (Such a power could carry with it a useful extension of Ministerial powers of control overnationalised industry prices if these are subsidised).    I think it is desirablealso to seek a power, by Order, to fix prices and margins for other foodswhich are especially sensitive in the household budget.    The mainmanufactured foods are subject to the Price Commission controls but thereare other important foods which are not, but under the profit margin control(eg frozen chickens).10.       As far as margins specifically are concerned, the main control onwholesalers and retailers under the Price Code is a requirement to limit their margins as a percentage of their sales.    This allows for an increasing cash mark-up as prices rise.11.       After discussion with the Chairman of the Price Commission, I am satisfied that a general move to a cash margin control is not feasible -mainly because retailers have met and are continuing to meet heavy cost increases (equal pay affects them particularly).    The Prise Commission isalready taking action to reduce gross percentage margins in the food tradeand I propose early amendments to the Price Code (see paragraph 17) toapply similar reductions across the board to all retailers.    But there may also be room for controlled margins on certain specified items not subjectto subsidy.12.       I propose therefore that in addition to Price Control powers forsubsidised goods, there should be additional powers to control prices andmargins for specified non-subsidised foods; these additional powers shouldbe available for a period of six to nine months capable of extension byOrder.2
VARIATION OF DECISIONS OF THE PRICE COMMISSION13.       The Counter-Inflation Act 1973 permits Ministers to intervene to give consent to a price rise which would otherwise be barred by thePrice Commission as inconsistent with the Price Code.    There is,however, no power for Ministers to intervene to set a price lower thanthe Price Code would permit but I believe that our commitments requireus to have such a power in reserve.PRICE MARKING14.       Where prices are prescribed, or margins are regulated, power will be needed to require the relevant information to be displayed in retail outlets.    It would be attractive to take the opportunity of this Billto secure a general power and such orders could be made about the displayof prices and price lists.15.       The Bill could also confer power, by Order, to require goods to bemarked with their &quot;unit price&quot;.    Such powers were contained in a bill which commanded general support, but was lost in the last Parliament.THE PRICE CODE16.       Under the 1973 Act, the Price and Pay Code is prepared by theTreasury and contained in a Treasury Order.    I assume that mycolleagues will agree that it would be appropriate for me to assumeformal responsibility of what will become a Price Code only.    In practice the expertise of officials in all Departments concerned will continue to berequired.I!17.       I consider that the Price Commission should continue to operate the general rules of the existing Code.    But there are some amendments to the existing rules and procedures which I consider urgently necessaryto slow down the present unacceptable rate of price increases:i. Retailers&apos; gross percentage marginsThe Code should be amended to impose a general reduction of10 per cent on all distributors&apos; gross margins (i. e. a 20 per centmargin reference would be reduced to 18 per cent, and a40 per cent margin to 36 per cent): but the safeguards fordistributors making small profits will need examination.ii. A minimum time limit between price increases the Code should be amended to impose a minimum period(e.g. 3 months) between price increases (but some exemption willbe needed, e. g. where large or frequent raw material pricerises have to be faced).
S w department of Prices and Consumer Protection12 March 19744The notification periods should he extended so that medium-sizedfirms as well as large firms have to give the Price Commission28 days advance notice before raising prices.    (The present limit is 14 days),iv. Price increases on existing stocksThis has caused much public annoyance and I am consideringurgently whether the Code can be amended to deal with it.18*       The 1973 Act requires statutory consultation before the Code isamended.    I invite my colleagues to agree that consultation on these changes should be put in hand right away, with a view to amending the Code as soonas possible (perhaps early in April, simultaneously with the introductionof the new Bill).II ;19.       My colleagues will recognise that many of the proposed powersand changes in the Code described above will be very controversial.It will undoubtedly be contended that the present regime provides a fair and comprehensible system of control and that arbitrary intervention by ministers will lessen confidence:   We shall need to make it clear thatthese new powers will be used responsibly in the present critical situation.20.       A further revision of the Price Code on many points will probablyprove necessary.    I believe that we should press on urgently with the short list of important points and reserve a more complex package for later on when there will have been opportunity for more carefulconsideration.    But I hope my colleagues will agree that the immediate measures I propose should be proceeded with at once.
