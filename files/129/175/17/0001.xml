annex aDRAFT STATEMENT BY THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH.SECRETARY IN THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS ON 1 APRIL1.    Mr Chairman, with your permission I should like to make a statement about the policy of my Government towards the Community,   It will come as nosurprise to you that the Labour Government opposes membership of the community on the terms that were negotiated at the time of our entry in January 1973oWe do not consider that they provided for a fair balance of advantages in theCommunity and we are of the opinion that the terms should have been specificallyput to the British people for their&apos;approval or otherwise.   We wish to putthese errors right and if we succeed there will then be a firm basis for continuing British membership of a strengthened Community.2.    We seek to raise with you a number of important questions on which my government consider a successful renegotiation to be necessary..   We shall negotiatein good faith and if we are successful in achieving^ths right,terms wo shall put them to our people for approval.   But if we fail, we shall submit to theBritish people the reason why we find the terms unacceptable and consult them on the advisability of negotiating the withdrawal of the United kingdom from the Community.   I am confident that no one in the Community would wishto argue that it would be in the interests of the Communityito seak to retainmy country as a member against its will.   But I stress that I do not hope fora negotiation about withdrawal.   I would prefer successful renegotiation fromwhich the right terms for continued membership will emerge.   To some extent thatwill depend upon,us - but it will also depend upon the attitude of the otherpartners in the negotiations.3.    For our part, we have made clear - in the Labour Party Manifesto for therecent election   - that &quot;Britain &quot;is a European nation, and a Labour britain would &apos;always&apos; seek a wider co-operation between the European peopleso&quot;   Iwould now like to quote a passage of fundamental-importance to my government from our ilanifeetoo&quot;In our view the terms of entry negotiated by the previous Governmentinvolved, as we have said, &quot;the imposition of food taxes on tcp of risingworld prices, crippling fresh burdens on our balance of payments, and adraconian curtailment of   the power of the British Parliament to settle1 -   ..
questions affecting vital British interests.&quot; This is why we are immediatelyseeking a fundamental renegotiation of the terms of &amp;R-try5 for which we havespelled out our objectives in the following terms -The   Labour Party opposes British membership of the European Communitieson the terms negotiated by the Conservative Governmenta7We have said that we are ready to renegotiate.In prejjaaring to renegotiate the entry terms, our main objectives arethese - ,Major changes in the Common Agricultural Policy, so that it ceases to be a threat to world trade in food products, and so that low-costproducers outside Europe can continue to have access to the British, food market.New and fairer methods of financing the COMMUNITY BUDGET.   Neitherthe taxes that form the so-called *own resources&apos; of the.Communities,nor the purposes, mainly agricultural support, on which the funds are mainly to be spent, are acceptable to us.   We would be ready tocontribute to Community finances only such sums as were fair inrelation to what is paid and what is received by other member countries.As stated earlier, we would reject any kind of international agreement which compelled us to accept increased unemployment for the sake ofmaintaining a fixed parity, as is required by current proposalsfor a European ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION.   We believe that the monetary problems of the European countries can be resolved onlyin a world-wide framework.The retention by PAFJjIAMENT of those powers over the British economy needed to pursue effective regional, industrial and fiscalpolicies.   Equally we need an agreement on capital movements whichprotects our balance of payments and full employment policiesaThe economic interests of the COMMONWEALTH and   the DEVELOPING2 .   ^-r&quot;   [ I
COUNTRIES must be better safeguarded.   This involves securing continuedaccess to the British market and, more generally, the adoption by an enlarged Community of trade and aid policies designed to benefit notjust &quot;associated overseas territories&quot; in Africa, but developing countries throughout the world.Mb harmonisation of VALUE ADDED TAX which would require us to taxnecessities.If renegotiations are successful, it is the policy of the LabourParty that, in view of the unique importance of the decision, thepeople should have the right to decide the issue through a GeneralElection or a Consultative Referendum.   If these 2 tests are passed,a successful renegotiation and the expressed approval of the majorityof the British people, then we shall be ready to play our full partin developing a new and wider Europe.If renegotiations do not succeed, we shall not regard the treaty obligations as binding upon us.   We shall then put to the british people the reasons why we find the new terms unacceptable, and consult them on the advisability of negotiating our withdrawal fromthe Communities.&quot;An incoming Labour Government will immediately set in train the proceduresdesigned to achieve an early result and whilst the negotiations proceed anduntil the British people have voted, we shall stop further processes of integration, particularly as they affect food taxes.   The Government willbe free to take decisions, subject to the authority of Parliament, in caseswhere decisions of the Common Market prejudge the negotiations. \\ Thus, theright to decide the final issue of British entry into the Market will be restored to the British people.3
4,    My Government now propose that we should consider together how the objectives can be met.   In view of the great importance of the issue of membership of the Community, my Govermient is now engaged in a root and branch reviewof the effect of Community policies and will place before you in due course in detail the proposals which we would wish to see the Community adopt inorder to remedy the situation.   In particular, we are examining with great care the working of the Common Agricultural Policy; the estimates for futurecontributions to and receipts from the Community budget; the Community&apos;strade1 and aid policies towards the Commonwealth and developing countries and how far in practice the existing rules, as they are interpreted, interferewith the powers over the British economy which we need to pursue effectiveregional, industrial and fiscal policies.   As soon as this review is completed,we shall be ready to put forward proposals for the changes which will in ourview be necessary if Britain is to remain   a member of the Community and thus,as the Manifesto put it, &quot;to play our full part in developing a new and widerEurope&quot;.5.    Why do my Government, and indeed the British people, question whether allis well in the Community as it is and why are we planning to seek changes?6.    First, we were deeply concerned by the resolutions of March 1971 and1972 which were confirmed at the Summit Meeting of October 19J2.   They seemedto lay down a rigid programme under which Economic and Monetary Union, includingpermanently fixed parities, would be achieved by 1980.   This seemed to us tobe dangerously over-ambitious:   over-ambitious because the chances of achievingby I98O the requisite degree of convergence of the rates of growth of production-vity and wages rates, of investment and savings, seemed to us to be very small:dangerous because of the impossibility for any country,   -particularly a country with a relatively low growth rate, to manage its own economy efficiently and provide for full employment if it accepted permanently fixed paritieswithout such convergence having been achieved.   I understand that much newthinking is going on in the Community on the subject of Economic and MonetaryUnion and that the proposals now being considered for a second stage in itdo not provide for automatic movement towards pernanerily fixed parities.   Youwill find our- objections very much lessened if we can all agree that therecan be no question of trying to force the pace, of compelling member countries to accept permanently fixed parities if this means accepting massive unemploy-ment or before their economies are ready.
7.    Then we are concerned at another phrase from the Paris Summit Communique -at the intention there stated of transforming the whole complex of the relations of member states into a European Union by 1930.   What does this mean?   Is itto be taken literally?   It seems to us to imply a change which is quiteunrealistic and not desired by our peoples, certainly not by the british people.   I understand that work on clarifying this issue is about to beginwithin the Community.   I shall watch carefully to see if this clarificationwill help to relieve our anxieties.0,  i Then there is the Common Agricultural Policy,   The position of the UnitedKingdom is different from that of the&apos;other Members of the Community in animportant sense.   We import a very much larger proportion of our food andif we have to pay a high price for these imports, this can impose a heavy&quot;burden on our balance of payments.   This is much more of a problem for usthan for other Members.   We are of course aware that thei Community*s prices are at present lower than they were relative to other Community prices andthat many of them are now below world prices.   But how long will this last?We are unable to agree to perpetuate policies that would allow the buttermountains and the cheap butter sales to Russia to recur.   Are you sure thatthere will be no future mountain of beef in store?   Have the interests of theconsumer been sufficiently safeguarded?   Could overseas producers have betteraccess to Community markets?   Is financial control sufficiently, strict?    It is our view that more needs to be done to keep down the cost of the CAP whichaccounts for 80 per cent of the Community budget.   At present the systemdoes not take sufficient account of the differing interests and circumstancesof member countries.   It confers   privileges on some and imposes unfairburdens on others.   That is why we shall certainly be proposing major changes.9.    Then there is the question of the trade of Commonwealth and developing countries, which is linked with the Common Agricultural Policy because of theneed to offer a fair deal to the Community^ consumers as well as to thesuppliers overseas.   We are not satisfied that the arrangements made in the entry negotiations are as good as they should have been, for the one or for theother.   We have in mind particularly sugar and New Zealand butter.   Apart fromchanges in the field of the Common Agricultural Policy, no doubt the general position could be improved if the Community*s generalised preference schemeundergoes serious improvement both in the industrial and agricultural sectorsI5
if -the Community when it comes to draw up its detailed mandate for the multilateral trade negotiations takes a literal attitude, especially aboutagricultural trade and if the Protocol 22 negotiations result in reallygenerous terms for access to our markets of developing countries* agricultural products, which is on the whole what they want to sell, as well as for theirindustrial products.   We are examining this whole field most carefully inthe context of renegotiation in order to see what should be done,10.   I turn next to the question whether existing rules interfere with thepowers over the British economy which we need to pursue effective regional,industrial, fiscal and counter-inflationary policies.  We want to be sure that,in cases where jobs are in danger or where there- is a need to sustain and develop valuable industrial capacity, we can give aid quickly and effectively.To give another example, co-ordination  of regional aids can usefully presentover-bidding for internationally available funds.   But there is a majordifference between those regional problems which are mainly agricultural andthose which are mainly industrial.   We want to make sure, in particular9 that,against this background, we can continue to give our own development areas the help which they need.11,   Finally, I come to the Community budget.   Here fundamental changes arerequired,   Britain!s income per head and her rate of growth is lower than inmany of your countries,   I take it you would agree that the out-turn of theCommunity budget should not in all justice result in massive subsidies acrossthe exchanges from my country to yours.   This is not acceptable,12,  We are not asking for charity.   We seek a fair deal.   In 1973 only paying8g- per cent of the Community budget in accordance with the transitional key,we were already the second largest net contributors.   At the end of our normal transitional  -period we shall be paying over 19 -per cent, well overthe 16-g- per cent which is our likely share of GNP at that time.   If thefull &quot;own resources&quot; system were to be applied to us with no changes in1980, we should find ourselves paying still more,   perhaps several percentagepoints more, of the Community budget - in even sharper contrast with the relatively low share of GNP we can then expect to have,   I am sure you will agree .that something must be done about that.   Britain cannot accept apermanent drain across the exchanges of several hundred million poundssterling a yearo6
13.   You. will wish to know how we would propose that this renegotiationshould proceed.   I can assure the Council that we do not wish to disrupt thework of the Community more than is necessary during the period of renegotiation.14.   I shall come hack to the Council at an early dato with detailed proposals on the Common Agricultural Policy, the treatment of the commonwealth and of developing countries and the Community &quot;budget.   I hope  you will agreeIfhen to have a general discussion; and to agree how certain of our requests for changes in the Community&apos;s arrangements should he handled.15*   Our initial approach will he to seek changes in the Community^ policies and decisions which will meet our needs.   We must see how we go and where wc get,But we shall have to reserve the right to propose changes in the Treatiesif it should turn out that essential interests cannot he met without them.   I must also reserve the right to propose changes in the Treaties, ifwe find that in practice the existing rules, as they are interpreted,  ,interfere with the powers over the British economy which we need to pursueeffective regional, industrial and fiscal policies.16.   I have spoken so far today about &quot;bread and &quot;butter issues for theseare very important to all our people.   But we are also deeply concerned about the politics of the Community; about the broad direction which itis going to take both in its internal development and in its relationswith other countries or groups of countries.17*   The image of the Community in the United Kingdom is not good.   Myoountry wishes to remain a member of an effective Atlantic Alliance; andthere is therefore concern about the degree of disagreement between theCommunity and the United States-.   Surely this is not inevitable.   If theBritish people thought it was, it would adversely influence their attitudetowards the development of the Community.18.  We shall not always be able to agree with the United States but theConimunity in devising its procedures and its common positions must always try to work with America whenever it can.   Conversely America must work with us.Only if the Nine work harmoniously with the United States on both economicissues in the framework of the Community and on political issues in the framework of political co-operation, shall we- surmount the difficulties towhich President Nixon and Dr Kissinger have recently drawn attention.
19*   We should also like to work with you to produce a stable, healthy andco-operative relationship with all those countries or groups of countries with whom Europe&apos;s life is intimately connected, for example with Japan,Canada and other industrialised countries; with the Commonwealth and theCommunity&apos;s AssociatesJ with the Arab countries; and with the Soviet union and Eastern Europe.20.   We are ready to intensify political consultation and co-operation.But before we can do so we need to agree on our broad aims.   I should certainly like to see if we can do this together.   The informal meeting to which our President has so kindly invited us later this month willprovide an excellent opportunity.21.   So to conclude we shall work for an early and successful result towhat we in Britain have come to call renegotiation, h Meanwhile we shallparticipate in the work of the Community and act in accordance withCommunity   procedures, subject only to not proceeding with further processes of integration if these seem likely to prejudge the outcome of thenegotiations.   Our aim will be to get an agreement which can be regardedas providing a fair balance of advantage for each of our countries.   Ifthis can bo achieved successfully! renegotiation will not damage tho Communitybut will strengthen it. I!27 March 1974II8
