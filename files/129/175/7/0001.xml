C(74) 7 COPY NO18 March 1974   .CABINET73DISCUSSIONS WITH THE TRADES UNION CONGRESSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for employment. From my informal discussions with the Trades Union Congress(TUC) it is clear that they accept that the statutory pay controls will haveto be maintained until repealed by fresh legislation and they are ready tohelp privately with any difficulties to which the controls give rise.    their economic Review (which is published today) recognises this position andinvites any union which finds itself in difficulty under it to seek their advice.    Len Murray is considering whether they can make a further statement supporting what I have to say in the Debate about continuanceof the controls; but in fact his statement in the review constitutes a mosthelpful advance on what he said about the uniqueness of the miners&apos; case.2.        I have also discussed with Murray how we should carry forward the undertaking in the Liaison Committee document of February 1973 that&quot;It will be the first task of that Labour Government on takingoffice, and having due regard to the circumstances at that time,to conclude with the TUC, on the basis of the understandingsbeing reached on the Liaison Committee, a wide-rangingagreement on the policies to be pursued in all these aspects ofour economic life and to discuss with them the order of prioritiesof their fulfilment&quot;.3.        He assures me that the TUC will be very ready to have a top levelmeeting at which to discuss the whole range of Government policies and priorities and the views now expressed in the tuc&apos;s Economic Review.They will probably say as much in presenting their Review to the Press.The meeting would aim to end with general agreement on the Government1 ssocial and economic approach which can then be followed up throughindividual contacts that the TUC would have with the different ministers responsible for the elements of the social contract.    Within that contextI would have separate informal meetings with the TUC on the pay aspectsin order to see what voluntary arrangements on pay would fit into thegeneral framework of agreement.
4.        It is absolutely clear, however, that the TUC would react stronglyand adversely against concentration at that first general meeting on the search for &quot;a voluntary incomes policy&apos;.    Any attempt on our part to try to extort from the TUC at the meeting some commitment as to thearrangements they might enter into on pay would fail and would jeopardiseour chances of securing satisfactory arrangements with them in laterdiscussions.5.        I recommend therefore that we should invite the TUC to an earlydiscussion, with the Prime Minister or Chancellor in the chair, on thelines and with the aim described in paragraph 3 above.    Meanwhile, Ishall pursue with Murray after/today&apos;s Debate how we can best proceed,in the separate pay discussions that I shall have with the TUC to establish the voluntary pay arrangements which will follow repeal of the statutorycontrols.MF   &apos;!Department of Employment18 March 1974.,f2
