PUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1975-76 TO 1978-79Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The Cabinet have agreed the limits within which we shall be running the 1974-75 public expenditure programmes.    We now need todecide how we shall settle programmes for 1975-76 to 1978-79.    Theissue for immediate decision is procedure not policies.2. The usual starting point is &quot;existing policies&quot;, costed in theannual public expenditure Survey.    But we would not accept as &quot;existing policies&quot; whatever our predecessors left to us; and in any case theyadmitted that the forward programmes of their White Paper (Cmnd 5519)of last December were overtaken by the energy crisis and by their cuts of 17 December on 1974-75.    We need therefore a different kind of surveyfrom officials.3. Our instructions to them must take account realistically of theeconomic prospect.    Annex 1 assesses this, and my judgment is asfollows: -a. Failure to make an impact on our main problems of inflation and the balance of payments would frustrate us invirtually everything we hope to do.b. Our management of demand for the whole period to1978 must be attuned to solving both these problems, yetwithout sacrificing a high level of employment.c. It would be unwise to base our plans for resourceallocation on a larger annual increment to national resources than 3 per cent per annum on average.d. From this total of resources we have to find the means ofrectifying the balance of payments step by step and also ofsecuring by productive investment the means of growth in thefuture.    For 1975-76 the claims of the balance of payments&apos; are specially urgent, because we shall then be facing the accumulated burden of a third year of massive borrowing.1w-&apos; a&apos;t. iii dc(74) 23 &apos;m   ISCOPY NO       $ Q4 April 1974CABINET
e.      Yet we must deploy our resources without starving theconsumer of enough real improvement in his position; we need his goodwill for our largely voluntary counter-inflationpolicy.    This means we have to avoid going too far in lettingtaxation raise prices or reduce incomes.    The judgment on how far it is practicable to squeeze the private consumerwithout his reacting with inflationary pay demands is the criticalone.4.        I conclude that w*$ should adopt for planning of public expenditure  modest basis: the level of expenditure on goods and services for1975-76 to be held close to that:in 1974-75 in real terms, growing in aggregate thereafter at about 2 per cent a year though not at this uniformrate for all programmes.    As regards transfers, we should applycomparable stringency, wherever practicable.5.        We need to know first what we would get for this money.    Annex 2explains the form of report to be commissioned from officialsaccordingly, as a base from which we can proceed to take our decisions on the priorities, policies and programmes.    Annex 3 gives thetechnical guidelines for officials work.    I will present their reporttogether with a further assessment of the medium term economic prospect.6.        I invite my colleagues to endorse my proposals in Annexes 2 and 3.D. H.Treasury Chambers4 April 19742
&apos; ANNEX 1THE ECONOMC BACKGROUND - TO 19781.1   The &quot;basic objectives of our economic policy must be to maintain a high level of employment and to contain inflation by a firmprices policy, and by a voluntary incomes policy based on socialjustice and the social contract.     We have to pursue these aimsagainst a background of low productive investment in our economy and a balance of payments deficit which must soon be closed.1.2   Increased productive investment is a first prior claim on the extra resources which will become available in the period up to1978.     If we fail to raise the level of this investment we shall find it hard to maintain oven the relatively modest growth rate of2r$&apos;o. of the last two decades let alone in due course to improve it.1.3   On the balance of payments we have at present the deficit dueto oil prices superimposed on a large underlying deficit.     Theposition is aggravated by the cost of servicing the external debts -public and private - which are mounting rapidly as the aggregatedeficit builds up.     We have to eliminate first the underlyingseas expenditure, the total deficit.     Offshore oil will help but,even when allowance is made for this, there is no escaping the needfor a substantial shift of resources into the balance of payments(by increased exports and increased import substitution)*     Therewill, correspondingly, be less resources available for our use athome.     It is possible that the task will be eased by the pricesof the primaries we import falling relative to the prices cf our exports by more than we at present forecast but we, could not inskieour public expenditure plans in the confident expectations thatthis would occur.     Indeed it is possible that the opposi^e&quot;^ccyuidhappen.1.4   The overall rate of increase in resources in the years up to1978 (ie the growth in GDP) depends on the growth in productive potential and the degree of capacity utilisation.     Since we intend to maintain a high level of employment we can plan forresources increasing to something close to the growth in productive potential between 1973 and 1978*     But the need to encourageexports implies that not too high a pressure of demand should be aimed for.1.5  As for the growth in productive potential, that depends onthe change in the size of the labour force, changes in hours worked, and the rise in.productivity.     Past changes in product-ivity in the UK suggest3hat the best assumption for the years1975-78 is a rise of about 3 per cent per annum (see Table 1).Allowing for the likely rise in the size of the labour force anda decline in hours worked we could put the rise in the productive potential also at around 3 per cent per annum.     One might, for .planning purposes, put the average rise in GDP 1973-78 also at per cent per annum.     In judging whether this is a pessimisticor optimistic assumption we should remember chat in the 20 years the growth in GDP has only in 8 years been greater than 3 percent and that the average for the period has been .2-  per cent.f f^sa C-^s ^
1.6   On the allocation of these extra resources preliminaryindications ere that the &quot;prior claims&apos; of productive investment (including that of the nationalised industries)and of the balance of payments might between them absorbhalf of the rise in GDP (see table 2).     It would benecessary to ensure that these prior claims did infact absorb these resources by encouraging investment and keeping exports and import substitutes competitiveand profitable.     This reallocation of the pattern ofour resources poses continuous problems of demand management and pricing and taxation policy on which wemust be successful.     But on the assumption that we are successful - and no other planning assumption can beaccepted - the needs of these &quot;prior claims&quot; imply that the resources available for other purposes(private consumption and public expem diture excludingnationalised industry investment) will grow only verymodest.ly - at well under 2% pa.1.7   In considering how these resources should be sharedbetween the public and private sectors we need to remember:(a) The rising proportion of the GDP taken in taxation (including national insurance contrib-contributions) or by public expenditure.     Between1962-64- and &quot;1974-75 the proportion of total public expenditure in GDP roso - from 38.8 per cent to/49oO per cent.     If the GDP is rising at 3% andthe rise in private consumption is to be held at% or below it implies a tax burden rising at an even faster rate than in the past and this couldexacerbate inflationary pressure.(b) On the other hand planning to relax theconstraint on private consumption by reducing evenmore sharply the growth rate of public expenditure. would produce its own problems.     The Governmentis committed to uprating pensions in line withreal pre-tax earnings which means that reductions in piiblic expenditure would have to take placelargely on purchases of goods and services.Private consumption, including that financed bypensions and other social transfers, is such alarge proportion of GDP that if it were to growin line with GDP - 3% pa - public expenditure on. goods and services would have to fall by nearly2 per cent per annum.(c) There is a particular problem about 1975-76on both the balance of payments front and on private consumption which has implications for the public expenditure planning for that year.     The largebalance of payments deficit of 1973 and 1974- willbe followed, on present forecasts, by another bad&apos;. deficit and heavy foreign borrowing in 1975*After that offshore oil and the steady movement of/&quot;f% rr- ir&quot; f^NV   \*Jr  i*m   &quot;&quot;&quot;iBf^  a  ^ - &quot;*i    fi    Jl__miMiin -iKwwni..........iiirnrri III   I , ,    .
resources into the balance of payments for which, we are planning should mean a rapidly improving position 1976-78.But the foreign borrowing 1973-75 implied on present forecastsis. so large that we need to make a maximum effort in ir;75 toimprove the trade balance ond reduce the prospective borrow-ing that year.     Yet, after the lean year, 1974-, it will bedifficult to squeeze private consumers particularly hardagain in 1975*     There is, therefore, a strong case for planning now to hold public expenditure in total in 1975-76as closely as possible to the level now planned for 197&apos;!-75-Then for 1976-77 to 1978-79 we could plan for public expend-iture to begin to grow once more,though at a very modestpace c jj(d)   The construction industry also poses particularproblems0     Construction costs rose very sharply in 1975and effects of higher energy costs on the raw materials ofconstructxon may mean tnat ws have to reconsioer the amountof public construction we can affprd in the years to come,if the balance of payments, productive investment and private consumption are to be reasonably served.     There has to be ashift of resources from somewhere and public construction may need to be one source..   But in 1975-76? demand on theindustry could be relatively low, and there would be a difficult transition to make to a level desirable in the

ANNEX 2PLANNING OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO  1978-792.1    In the normal way tho public expenditure Survey whichwould sot out the latest,estimates of the cost of existing policies,  and thus provide the basic material for ministerial decisions later in the year, would by now be well advanced.But in many programmes there is at present no firm basis of&quot;existing policies&quot; on which officials can work.    Thelast annual. White Paper on pub3.ic expenditure (Cmnd 5519)published by our predecessors in December was,  as theyadmitted,  already overtaken by the oil crisis.    V7e ourselvesneed to establish our own priorities for public spending.2.2   However we have already taken some major decisions to implement our commitments which will substantially increase&apos; i I        It - / v.exjjenditure in the yeai^s after 197^-75-    In the light ofthe economic prospects summarised in Annex 1 and thecompelling need to re-establish a sound balance of payments position, we must keep the other demands of the public sector under firm control.2.3 In this situation I propose that I should arrange for officials to conduct the 197^ public expenditure survey onthe following basis:(a)    As regards expenditure on the purchase of goods and services,  other thandefence,thecapital expenditure of the nationalised industries,infrastnshore    oil,  &apos;rNorthern Ireland the aim would be to keep thetotal of that expenditure in 1975-76 close to/the total
towards this is to divide the total betweenthe programmes,  to provide a working basis.    my proposals for this limited purpose are setout in. Annex 3*    The next step is to obtain fromofficials a report which would show how resourcesif so allocated could best be used in eachof the programmes.    The final step would beoui&quot; decisions on. the report from officials.(b) For 1976-77 - 1978-79 it would be reasonable to plan for some modest resumption of growth onour new base for 1975-76 in the public sector&apos;demand on resources as a whole.    My proposal in. Annex 3t  again for the limited purpose of the officials&apos;  report,  is that the programmes shouldbe such as to keep the totals within the percentagerates of growth derived from Cmnd 5519*(c) It has been agreed that the defence programme should be the subject of separate and urgent consideration,  to establish the possible reductionsfor each year of the forward period.(d) As regards the capital expenditure of the nationalised industries, much but not all of whichis an essential base for industrial expansion,  the size of each industry*s programme should bere-examined with the Treasury in the light of thedemand for its products and commercial prospectsand its contribution to productive capacity and exports.?
(o)    Expenditure on infrastructure required nr.a direct consequence of the development ofoffshore     oil should be examined separatelyWith the Treasury apart from other programmesbut on consistent standards.(f) We have already agreed letrge additions to housing expenditure in 1974-75&apos;    These couldimply even larger additions in subsequent years.Wo. shall need to consider later this year howfar we can accept those implications.    scope for further additions beyond these is bound to be&apos; . II fvery limited.(g) The Northern Ireland Executive will be putting forward proposals for additional expenditure inNorthern Ireland in a few months&apos;  time.    This will present a special problem.(h) The main transfer paymentstboth to persons andto companies, need to be dealt with separately sincethe level of expenditure normally followsautomatically from major policy decisions.    Theeffects on demand,  and thus the implications for taxation,  are in many cases considerable,  and increases in transfers thus limit the extent towhich direct expenditure on resources can alsobe increased.    It will be appropriate to scrutinizesome types of transfer payments,  case by case,with the same stringency as applies to goods and services.
(i)    We shall also need to take into account the implications for expenditure of our progressin negotiating changes in the policies of theEuropean Communities.2.4    I appreciate that for several progi-ammes this approjreb,particularly in 1975-76, will involve major reappraisals.    Butthis is essential in any case if we are to be sure that theresources wo can devote to the programmes are applied tothe best effect as we see it.    Final decisions can bo takenlater in the year when I have been able to examine with my colleagues the implications for their policies.    But if we novset out to cost the programmes on a more expansive basis we shalDinevitably be faced with quite unacceptable totals for 1975-76and later years and a most difficult task in making thenecessary reductions, with little time to do it.2.5    Given the uncertainty about our prospects which is bound to persist,  figures for the later years of the period wouliin any case be provisional in a more radical sense thanthose for 1975-76.    For those years it will be progressively more important to arrange commitments so as to provide forthe essential&quot; hard core of any programme,  and to avoidexcessively limiting our room for manoeuvre.2.6    It will be important to fit within the total resources available for public expenditure in each year a realisticcontingency reserve./1
ANNEX 3BASIS TO  Mi; ADOPTED IN ARRIVING AT THEEXPENDITti;Hi FIGURES TO I3E ENTERED INTHE .197^, SUKVEY FPU  1975-76 AND LATER YEARSGoods and services -1     The broad aim is to ensure that the totality ofexpenditure on goods and services  (ie all capital and current expenditure other than transfers)  shall run asfollows:(i) for 1975-76: no change from 197/ -75i  saveinsofar as expenditure on wages and salarieswas expected to increase;(ii) for 1976-77 to 1978-79:  an average annual increase of about 2 per cent,  being    &apos;approximately the increase envisaged in the197^ Public Expenditure1White Paper (Cmnd 5519).But within this overall aim,  the figures for main programmes would continue to display the same relative rates of changeas were implied in Cmnd 5519*    This broad aim would beachieved by adoption of the following arrangements.3*2      1975,-76*    take the main programme figures in Cmnd 5519and calculate 12%% of the current expenditure on goods and services other than wages and salaries (following thedefinitions used for the cuts of 17 December 1973)1  and25% of the capital expenditure  (gross domestic fixed capital formation).-.    The sum of these two is the amount by which theCumcl 5519 figures have to be reduced; but the Departmentmay make the reduction as it sees fit over the whole of its expenditure on goods and services,  capital and current,.         ^ &quot;Si.j. ,% .. c
i \ l .including wages and salaries,  in respect of each main programme.    \mere a Department has expenditure in these categories in more than one programme,  the Department mayaggregate and redistribute the total.     (In the case ofsome programmes the figures for &quot;other current expenditureon goods and services&quot; resulting from the use of the national income accounts classification include elements in respectof wages and salaries,  and of rents and rates.    These elementsshould be subtracted before applying the reductionsdescribed above.    The Treasury will give detailedinstructions to Departments).3*3     1976-77i    calculate the rate of growth for the totalof all current and capital expenditure on goods and services(including wages and salaries) implied in Cmnd 5519 between1975-76 and 1976-77.    Apply that rate of growth to thecorresponding figure for 1975-76 arrived at under pa^agaia^h 3*above.    The resultant figure provides the ceiling for expen-diture in 1976-77 on goods and services.    Within that ceilingthe Department may suggest whatever disposition of thoseresources will best serve its policy ends.3*/jL     ,1977&quot;7ft -    as for 1976-77,  mutatis mutrmdi-s,. the basebeing of course moved forward one year.3*5-    197837.9&apos;    calculate the average annual rate of increaseimplied in Cmnd 5519 for the years 1975-76 to 1977-78 inrespect of the total of all current and capital expenditureon. goods and services.    Apply this average annual rate to the1977-78 figure resulting from paragraph 3*&apos;* above.    This/provides.
provides a ceiling for expenditure on goods and service as in the two preceding years.3.6      Exemptions.:     Five programmes - Defence, nationalised industry capital expenditure,  infrastructure for   offshoreoil, Mousing and Northern Ireland - will be exempt fromthis arrangement,  as indicated, in Annex 2, paragi-aph 2.3(a)/&quot;Transfers&quot;t mi-    --- x ^   _...____..... x 4 xi.....x ^-f^-^ -    ^.Jo ( xiivjj. w jiao   j[j a ea urnp k. x un    mo ai t;exempt from the spirit of the approach to direct expenditureon goods and services,  and the aim will be to apply comparablestringency to them wherever practicable.
