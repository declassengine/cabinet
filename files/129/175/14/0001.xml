DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74)14 COPY NO    r/g20 March 1974\ CABINET//   CONCORDEMemorandum hy the Attorney general. The Solicitor General and I are giving urgent consideration to theextent of our commitment (if any) to the French Government under the 1962Anglo-French Treaty and to the legal considerations that should be borne in mind in negotiating with the French about Concorde.    While the legalissues involved are complex, we hope to be able to give an opinion on thismatter in the near future.    In the meantime it is important that nothing should be said in the course of negotiations with the French or in publicwhich could commit us to any particular view of the legal position or couldprejudice a contention which we might in due course wish to advance.2.        I should also add that the Solicitor General and I are likely to advise that if the United Kingdom decides to cancel unilaterally, ie against thewishes of the French, the extent to which the Government has explainedand discussed the position with the French before reaching that decisionmay be a very important consideration in determining whether we arelegally justified in cancelling.    We should therefore regard it as imprudentand potentially dangerous for the Government to announce a decision to cancel without first having bona fide explored with the French Governmentall the possible courses of action short of cancellation.3. The Secretary of State for Industry proposes that a SelectCommittee of the House of Commons should be invited to consider the issue.There could, in our opinion, be serious disadvantages from the legal pointof view in this course, though it is difficult to evaluate them withoutknowing the precise terms of reference of the Select Committee and towhat extent its proceedings and recommendations are to be made public.Whatever may be decided on these points, however, it does seem to us thatif this course were adopted views are likely to be expressed by or in theSelect Committee either relating directly to the legal position or giving an embarrassing interpretation of facts upon which our future legal position may be based.    This could easily prejudice the presentation of our case
in the course of our negotiations with the French and in any legal proceedings which, if we decided to cancel unilaterally, the Frenchmight take.    That prejudice could extend both to any issue of liabilityand to any issue of the amount of compensation payable.S C SLaw Officers1 Department20 March 19742
