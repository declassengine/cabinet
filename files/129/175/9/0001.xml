FAMILY PLANNINGXMemorandvim by the Secretary of State for Social Services10 In this paper I invite my colleagues to consider an immediate situation which has arisen affecting our commitment in the Manifesto&quot;to introduce a free family planning service&quot;,,    Although I have accepted that we cannot this year fulfil our commitment to abolish prescription charges in full, I believe it would be politically impossible to impose new ones.PRESCRIPTION CHARGES2. From 1 April family planning services will be available under theNational Health Service (NHS) through the clinics transferred from localauthorities, and from hospital clinics.    Our predecessors were committed to lay regulations by 1 April to make a prescription charge forcontraceptive drugs and other supplies.    Some 30, mainly Labourcontrolled, local authorities have not been charging and indeed some have written to me about their desire to continue a free service by repaying tothe Area Health Authorities any charges they impose.    We ourselves on  July 1973 voted on a two line Whip for family planning to be free fromprescription charges; the Lords twice rejected the previous governments proposals for charging.    The Liberals are committed to free family planning.    We have reiterated our policy in the Manifesto.    Against this background I do not believe we can lay regulations for charging.    Theimmediate cost of not doing so will be  0. 7 million (Great Britain) in1974-75.liDOCTORS3.        Such a decision has wider implications.    The previous Governmentwas committed to introducing a comprehensive family planning service.Such a service requires family doctors and hospitals as well as the transferred clinics.    Up to now family doctors have taken private feesfor their &apos;social&apos; cases.    Hospital doctors also give private fee services,including vasectomies, for &quot;social1 cases.1C(74)9 COPY NO  ^19 March 1974CABINET
4. How to bring in these two groups of doctors is causing dissension.The family doctors want to replace the private practice income from family planning by new payments from the NHS.    A scheme is ready for pricingby the Review Body on Doctors and Dentists Remuneration.    TheDepartment of Health and Social Security proposals to the Review Bodyincluded in the Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC) would eventuallycost  5 million per annum; the doctors claim  20 million.    Supplies ofcontraceptives were costed in PESC at  12 million (Great Britain), which took account of  2 million recoverable if the prescription charge were imposed.    It would be impossible in principle to defend having family planning free in clinics and yet subject to prescription charges whenprescribed by the general practitioner.    It would also create innumerableanomalies.5. The hospital doctors are not prepared to have the &apos;social1&apos; casesabsorbed into their existing medical contracts with the National health service without extra payments.    They fear a worsening of their positionrelative to family doctors, and might block the development of services in hospitals by their stand.6. The family doctors, as independent contractors, are entitled to aseparate priced contract for this new National Health Service work and Ipropose that the scheme should be submitted to the Review Body now.    Iintend to say to the Review Body and to the profession that while I amcommitted to the principle of general practitioner participation I could notintroduce a scheme without regard to the severe public expenditurelimitations to which we are all subject.    In the meantime they will go on with private services, including private charges for supplies, as it is unlikely that any agreement could be implemented before October.7. Hospital doctors are National Health Service employees and theprinciples of their contracts are to be examined by the Joint Working party  announced last week, which also will be looking at private practice.    Inthe meantime the new health authorities will have to be told to operate withinthe terms of the previous arrangements.    They will continue to pay hospital doctors separately for work done in the ex-local authority clinics and via the agency of the Family Planning Assocation.    The authorities will not beexpected during this interim period to expand deliberately the work being done in hospitals and will not be authorised to pay for such work over and above the existing basis of contract; however, if individual hospital doctors, choose to undertake more hospital work tinder their existing contracts Ishall make it clear that this additional service will not prejudice in any waythe negotiations in the Joint Working Party.conclusion*        I invite my colleagues to agree that I should announce our intention to introduce a free family planning service; that we shall not beimposing charges for clinics and hospital services on 1 April; that weshall not impose prescription charges for supplies prescribed by general
practitioners if we are able to reach agreement over their contract; thatwe accept general practitioner participation in principle, that the draft scheme should go to the Doctors and Dentists Review Body for pricingdrawing attention to the public expenditure implications; and that the participation of hospital doctors will be discussed in the Joint working party.B department of Health and Social Securityj /&apos;19 March 19743
