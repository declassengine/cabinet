C(74) 18 COPY NO     ni29 March 1974CABINETSPEAKER&apos;S CONFERENCE ON ELECTORAL, LAWMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department, The dissolution left the Speaker&apos;s Conference on Electoral Law witha good deal of unfinished business, including the question of electionexpenditure (other than candidates&apos; expenses).    If the precedent of 1966was followed, the Prime Minister would invite Mr Speaker to reconstitutethe Conference and Mr Speaker would inform the House that he had agreedto do so.    Such an announcement would inevitably prompt questions aboutelectoral reform.2. The Speaker&apos;s Conference in 1967 considered proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote system, and rejected it by 19 votes to 1.    Since it was then included in the terms ofreference, we can hardly object if the Liberals propose it again,particularly since the Conservatives are committed to supporting a reference to the Conference on this point.    In the circumstances I believethat there might be advantage, when inviting the Leaders of theConservative and Liberal Parties to agree that the Conference should be reconstituted, in our proposing, in a low pressure way, that it should consider the possibility of changes in our electoral system.    In the Lordsdebate on 26 March there was fairly general agreement that a Speaker&apos;conference would be the right forum for such consideration.3. The alternative would be consideration by a Select Committee Qfthe House of Commons, and this is a course suggested by1Lord Crowther-Hunt on the grounds that a Speaker&apos;s Conference usuallyadduce no argument in their report to support their recommendations, and do not publish a record of their deliberations (though the Conferenceconvened in the last Parliament did publish a record of written and oral evidence they received).    My own view is that there would be advantage in having this question considered by a Conference dealing with other questions of electoral law and presided over by Mr Speaker.    There is nothing to prevent this Conference presenting a fuller report, with reasons,on this issue, and I think they could with advantage be asked to do so onthis occasion.
4.        Another possible item is the question of publishing opinion pollsduring the run-up to a general election.    This too was considered in 1967by the Speakers Conference, who recommended (by a majority of 9 votes to 5) that there should be no publication of the result of a public opinionpoll or of betting odds on the likely outcome of a Parliamentary electionfor 72 hours before the close of poll.    The Government, however, in a white Paper on the Conference report, said that they did not think thisrecommendation should be accepted.    This view was supported by theConservative front bench and the Liberal leadership, and therecommendation was not proceeded with.    The last election has of courserevived comment on the subject.    My own view is there should be norestrictions in these matters, and that we should not take the initiative in proposing this as an item for the Speaker&apos;s Conference, although we neednot object if one of the other Parties proposes it.5. I invite my colleagues to agree that we should propose to theLeaders of the Conservative and Liberal Parties that the terms ofreference of a reconstituted Speaker&apos;s Conference should include an item(as in 1967) &quot;Methods of election, with particular reference to preferentialvoting&quot;, and that the Conference should be asked to report on this item assoon as may be, with reasons for any recommendation they may make.R H j home Office29 March 19742
