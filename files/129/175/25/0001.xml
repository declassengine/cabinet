REPEAL OF THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS act memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment. I have had discussions with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) andthe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) about the proposals for legislation to repeal the Industrial Relations Act.2.        Overwhelmingly, the main concern of the TUC is that the Bill asproposed by us should become ?.aw as swiftly as possible.    They haveanxiety about three other points:a. The proposed power to make regulations on picketing,b. The proposal for safeguards against arbitrary exclusionor expulsion from union membership.c        The effect of the transitional provisions on cases now before the National Industrial Relations Court (NIRC).3,        The CBI&apos;s general view is that the proposals make too manyconcessions to the trade unions.    They are particularly concerned aboutthe extension of legal immunities in regard to interference with commercial contracts and about the proposal to allow pickets to stopvehicles.PICKETING4.        The proposal to allow pickets to stop vehicles has aroused muchcontroversy.    The view expressed in discussions with other Ministershas been that we were unlikely to get it through Parliament unless it was accompanied by a power to make regulations (or a code of practice) asproposed in the consultative document.    But it is this power which the tuc oppose, partly on the ground that it might be used by a future government to curtail drastically the rights of pickets.C(74) 25 COPY no. 5 April 1974CABINET
5. My own strong preference would be to revert to our original proposal to reassert the right to peaceful picketing, as laid down in the1906 Act (but without the picketing of homes) and to extend this to cover the peaceful stopping of vehicles.    However, if there is still objection tothis latter part of the proposal, I would agree and I think the TUC would agree that the wisest course is to leave the question of stopping vehiclesto be dealt with under a subsequent Bill.    This would mean that only the amended 1906 provision would be in the Bill, and, if this course was followed, I would wish to explain our attitude to the question in the SecondReading debate.SAFEGUARDS AGAINST ARBITRARY EXCLUSION OR EXPULSION FROMUNION MEMBERSHIP6.        This has been the main point of difference with the TUC.    Theyhold strongly to the view that such safeguards are unnecessary becausethe problem is effectively taken care of by unions&apos; own domesticprocedures, with the possibility of complaint to the High Court in certaincircumstances.7.        Although these arguments have much force I am sure there will be pressure in Parliament for some safeguards on this particular point inthe legislation.    The Donovan Commission, while recognising that casesof serious injustice were few, recommended such safeguards.    That being so, it would be better to write them into the Bill now than to have somethingmuch less acceptable inserted on the Opposition^ initiative.-8.        I therefore propose to include in the Bill a right of complaint where,in a closed shop situation, arbitrary exclusion or expulsion from unionmembership has resulted in substantial injustice.    Complaints would be heard by a special tribunal consisting of a legal chairman and two membersnominated by the TUC.    The tribunal would be able to make a declarationof rights and to award compensation up to the same limit as that forunfair dismissal; it could not, however, order reinstatement.    Thetribunal would not normally be able to deal with complaints unless unionprocedures had been fully used, and it would be a valid defence if theunion could show that it had acted in accordance with the Bridlingtonprinciples.TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS&apos; II&apos; &apos; &quot;&quot;&apos;9. The TUC are understandably anxious about some important cases which are already before the NIRC, especially that of General AviationServices v Transport and General Workers Union which could result in heavy compensation being awarded against the union.    Under the present proposals, cases which are still before the NIRC when the Repeal Billtakes effect would be transferred to the High Court or the Court of session and dealt with by those Courts under the provisions of the 1971 Act.- &quot;. - &apos;   f^12
10.       I have discussed with the Lord Chancellor, the Attorney Generaland the Lord Advocate how much further it might be possible to go to help the TUC.    The Lord Chancellor^ view is that it would not be defensibleto extinguish all rights of action under the 1971 Act when the Repeal Billcomes into force, or to substitute rights under either the new or thepre-1971 law.    He has, however, suggested that in cases started in theNIRC after the publication of the Repeal Bill and still unfinished when that bill takes effect, the plaintiffs rights might be automatically extinguished;cases started before that date would be treated as proposed in the consultative document.    This would apply to complaints of unfair industrialpractice originating in the NIRC and not to appeals coming to the Courtfrom industrial tribunals.11.        Such a provision would no doubt discourage the launching of freshproceedings while the Bill was going through Parliament, but it would beof no help to the trade unions in the kind of case referred to inparagraph 9.    From that point of view a complete cut-off of existingproceedings when the Repeal Bill comes into force would be much more attractive.    However, I suppose we must accept that the Lord Chancellorssuggestion is as far as we can go and this is the provision now beingincorporated in the Bill.TIMETABLE12.       It is planned to introduce the Bill on 1 May and to have theSecond Reading on 6 May.M department of employment April 19743
