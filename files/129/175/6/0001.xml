DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 6V    &apos; COPY NO   ft13 March 1974 &apos;CABINET1974 UPRATING OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS11 f  f    &apos;4. &apos;       -      I ft  ; &apos;Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social ServicesScale of Uprating111. The purpose of this paper is to put before my colleagues my proposals for the 1974 uprating of social security benefits.    They areconditioned by our over-riding Manifesto commitment to bringimmediate help to existing pensioners by increasing the standard rate ofthe pension to  10 single and  16 married; and I have trimmed everythingto the achievement of this purpose.     Thus I do not propose anything inthis uprating on family allowances or on disablement on both of which wehave Manifesto commitments;  nor have I provided for any improvements in a number of other benefits (in particular maternity and death grants)or in the earnings rule for which we have pressed in the past.    I amalso suggesting that we should not increase the short-term benefits,including in particular unemployment benefit and the correspondingordinary scale rates of supplementary benefit by more than an amountsufficient to cover the likely increase in prices.    corresponding increases would be made in the rates of War Pensions and industrial injury benefits.Financing of Uprating2. I am discussing this with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andwill report to the Cabinet on it.Timing3. A vital point will be the date of implementation of the increases.The Chancellor has told me that he thinks the appropriate time to makethe increase is at the beginning of October. However the universalexpectation, not least among our own supporters in the parliamentary labour Party and the country, is that we will introduce the increase atthe earliest possible moment, and at a date which is well in advance ofthe autumn date for upratings which has applied in the last three years.1
SECRET   . /We must remember in this context, that the Opposition committed themselves in their Manifesto to six-monthly upratings.    If our pensionincrease to  10 (ie an increase of  2-25) does not operate until October,and has to last until October 1975, the pensioner could, by the end ofthis period, be not significantly better off than under a Conservativepolicy of 6-monthly upratings pn a cost-of-living basis.    For exampleif the cost of living rises by 15 per cent this year the pension wouldin any case be increased to  9 in. October under the Conservative cost-of-living formula, with another uprating to come 6 months later.     this might well bring the pension almost to our  10 figure 6 months before our next uprating in October 1975.   The Trades Union Congress of courseregard the earliest possible increase to  10/16 very much as a prioritypart of the &quot;social compact&quot;, and at a meeting which I had with theirSocial Insurance Committee yesterday to discuss longer-term matters,they pressed me very strongly for a date as early as April.4.        April is administratively impossible.    But, by cutting everyconceivable corner, I can bring the operative date forward to the week beginning 22 July, provided that we make a firm decision on the mainrates and the date by the end of this week.Conclusion 15. I realise that an earlier date of implementation for the upratingthis year means greater expenditure in 1974-75 - roughly at the rate of c* 100 million for each month.    This would, however, be very largelyoffset by the increase in contributions.    Moreover, as I have said, I regard the earliest possible date as vital to the maintaining of our political momentum, and I have pared down my other proposals to theutmost in order to concentrate on the achievement of the  10/16 pension.I therefore hope my colleagues will agree that the operative date for the uprating this year should be in the week beginning 22 July.B department of Health and Social Security13 March 19742
