OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 12 COPY NO     ? 619 March 1974CABINETTHE CHANNEL tunnel memorandum by the Central Policy Review staff. In his memorandum (C(74) 8) the Secretary of State for the environment recommends that Phase II of the Channel Tunnel project should continue.    His main reasons are:-a. The decision whether to continue with Phase II or abandon the project must be taken very soon: it would be impossible tocarry out a thorough reappraisal before this decision has to betaken.b. The difference in cost between abandoning the project nowas compared with doing so at the end of Phase II is relatively small (between SL4j million and  13\ million).c. It might be inopportune to exacerbate relations with theFrench by immediate cancellation at a time when European economic community renegotiations are being started and difficult decisions on concorde are imminent.2.        It is clear, however, that if it is decided to continue with Phase II,the review which the Secretary of State proposes should be both thorough and radical.    The main reasons for this are:-a. Last year&apos;s forecasts showed that 68 per cent of Tunnelrevenues would come from tourist traffic (most of it passenger cartraffic) and only 15 per cent from business traffic and 17 per cent from freight: the project is thus very sensitive to changes inholiday patterns and the use of cars for long-distance holidays;these forecasts were prepared before the recent dramatic increasein oil prices, and now need a fresh reappraisal in the light of thenew energy situation.b. If the Tunnel were not built, substantial alternative investment would be required in ships, ports and aircraft: in the light of the newuncertainties these have the advantage that they can be provided in stages as the traffic grows, without the risks of a large once-for-allinvestment in the Tunnel.1
c. The report of the Monopolies Commission on cross-Channelferries, which is now available but not published, shows thatthere is scope for substantial reductions in ferry fares: this alsomust be taken into account.d. In addition to the financial commitments set out in theSecretary of state  s paper the Tunnel would involve investment ofat least  120 million in the rail link, which would be a directclaim on public expenditure in the period 1976-1980.3.        All the studies which have been made of the Channel Tunnel on theBritish side, ie for the Channel Tunnel companies&apos; financial appraisal,for the British Government&apos;s cost benefit analysis and now for thereappraisal being undertaken as part of Phase II, have been carried outby the same consultants.    Officials have been able to supervise the work during the last two studies but the key assumptions and judgments have all been made by the consultants who were initially employed by thecompanies.    Without doubting the impartiality of the consultants in anyway, it will now be very difficult for them to stand back and take a freshlook at their original assumptions and judgments in the light of the changeof circumstances.recommendations.        If Ministers decide to go ahead with Phase II:a. They should commission a thorough and radicalreappraisal based on the extensive information and analysiswhich already exists, but carried out by fresh consultants.b. In presenting to Parliament the legislation necessary forPhase II they should make it unambiguously clear that the commitment to Phase II is not a commitment to the whole project,so that if they eventually decide to cancel they will not be embarrassed or inhibited by statements made in the course of getting the next piece of legislation through Parliament.Cabinet Office19 March 19742
