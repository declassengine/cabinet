19 March 1974CABINETCONCORDEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for industry. My Commons statement and memorandum established beyond doubt that Concorde will never be economic in the sense that ourinvestment and production costs cannot be recovered.    I am howeverconvinced that we should postpone a decision pending a select committee report, consultation with interested parties and negotiations with theFrench.THE FIGURES PROVIDE AN INADEQUATE PICTURE2.        The forecasts in my memorandum are guesstimates never beforesubjected to public criticism and form no basis for decision making.The employment figures are drawn on a very narrow basis and do not include secondary employment.    The cancellation cost of  80 millionincludes no allowance to bring in new work nor to cope with the secondaryeffects of cancellation.THE IMPORTANCE OF CORRECT POLITICAL HANDLING3. We face a series of costed options, each option involving a net costto public funds.    It is a political choice which calls for skilful politicalhandling.LEGAL RISKS WE RUN4.        A unilateral cancellation on Budget Day might be in breach of our treaty obligations.    The French seem to be indicating their intent to holdus to our commitments.THE LINK WITH RENEGOTIATION5. Our handling of this project must not embitter our relations withthe French during the period of renegotiating the terms of entry into theEuropean Economic Community.OUR RELATIONS WITH THE TRADE UNIONS6.        Our commitment to real consultations with the trade union movement,upon which so many other policies hang, would be gravely damaged by aprecipitate cancellation leaving them no time to make their views known.The President and Secretary of the Confederation of Engineering and shipbuilding Unions made this clear to me personally.i    &apos;73C(74) 10 COPY NO      u
WE HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE PLANS7. We have given no thought -whatsoever to the industrial or social consequences and have no alternative plans ready for those who would besacked.THE DANGERS OF A SECRET DECISION8.        It would destroy the integrity of any Minister involved in subsequent discussions with the trade unions if he pretended to listen tothe representations that they made when he would know, and they would soon guess, that the decision had already been made.    Nor could talks in Paris be kept secret if the Cabinet had reached a decision and theFrench were to be told, however indirectly, of the Cabinefs decision.    Aleak would completely destroy the credit we earned by publishing thefigures on Monday.THE FRENCH MIGHT GO IT ALONE9. The French might accept cancellation of the British funding of concorde, continue to build some Concordes in Toulouse, hold british airways to their firm order for Concordes, offer to pay British aircraft corporation and Rolls-Royce to supply the parts they need, at Frenchexpense, and expect the British Government to fund this diminishingsub-contracting in lieu of formal damages.PARLIAMENT MUST HAVE TIME TO CONSIDER THE position: ,,   &quot;10.        The House of Commons upon which we now rely for our survivalon a day-to-day basis must be granted a meaningful chance to hold its ownenquiry before the Cabinet reaches a decision.    I understand that theSelect Committee on Science and Technology may propose an urgentinquiry to be completed within a month.THE GOOD NAME OF THE GOVERNMENT11.        To cancel now would be to act with the same authoritarianirresponsibility about workers1 livelihoods, trade union sensibilities and national feelings as the previous Government or some large private business corporations.RECOMMENDATIONS12.       I therefore recommend to my colleagues that:i. A Select Committee of the House of Commons be invitedto consider the issue, take evidence and report by 1 May.ii. A small Ministerial Committee be set up to consider and cost all the alternatives, including cancellation and itsconsequences, and report by the same date.iii. Representations received from interested outside bodiesbe reported to that Committee.2
iv. My discussions with the French Minister responsibleinclude a probing of their attitude to all these alternatives.v. A final Cabinet decision be reached and announced, ifpossible with agreement with the French, by early June,A W B(department of Industry19 March 19743
