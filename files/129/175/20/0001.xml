[US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(74) 20 COPY NO g2 April 1974CABINETBUILDING SOCIETIESNote by the Secretary of State for the environment. My colleagues will wish to consider the attached note by officialsabout the short term problems of building society finance.2.        In my view it is politically imperative to prevent mortgagerates from increasing.    An across-the-board subsidy is unpalatablebut it appears to be unavoidable as an immediate measure.    To acceptmortage rationing, rather than ending the famine, will keep down the cost,but will mean fewer houses started and sold this year than in 1973.3. In the meantime we must try and ease matters by getting funds for building societies from, for example, the Eurodollar market.4. We shall, however, have to find a more lasting solution if our plans for encouraging home-ownership and stepping up the rate of house building in the private sector are not to suffer. I believe ahigh-powered Committee working at speed will be necessary.A department of the environment  April 1974
HOTS BY OFFICIALSBUILDING SOCIETIESPresent PositionU     Building societies had a small net outflow of funds in february and the position in March seems likely to be worse.     The 12 largestsocieties had a net outflow of  19 million in the week ending23 March, and although this could have been due to special pre-Budgetfactors, the societies now fear a major liquidity crisis.   They donot think the Budget itself gave them much help.    Indeed, they areconcerned that the overall effect of the Budget will be to induce someof their investors to withdraw funds in order to meet higher commit-ments.&apos;   Their own judgement is that, to maintain confidence andfrom traditional sourcesproduce a modest net inflow of funds^ an immediate increase in their investment and mortgage rates (to 9% net and 13/&quot; gross respectively)is necessary.   At their Council meeting on 28 March, however, they agreed to defer a decision on rates till 9 April when they have arranged a further special meeting.   If Ministers are to intervene,therefore, rapid decisions are required.Need for Assistance2.   Owner occupiers currently benefit from tax relief of about  00 million a year and the present mortgage rate, net of tax relief,is about 7h% - a negative real rate of interest given an annual rateof inflation in double figures.   A mortgage rate of 137  will add tothe difficulties of some potential first time purchasers and some whohave purchased their houses at the high prices of the last coupleof years.    For the remainder, however, with past j(confidential)
ONFIDENTIALand prospective increases in income, and substantial tax-freecapital appreciation, a higher mortgage rate may not be an intolerable burden.Objectives3.     The immediate objective must be to stem the outflow of funds^avert a collapse of confidence.   This, in itself, will require soiincrease in investment rates, though this need not necessarily be passed on to mortgagers if Government assistance were provided.Beyond this, Ministers will wish to consider whether they attachmost importancea. to attracting a significant net inflow to end the mortgagefamineb. to avoiding any increase in mortgage rates or c.     to avoiding public expenditure or equivalent monetary sup:It is most unlikely that we can have all three together unless theis a very marked reduction in interest rates generally, which canbe relied on in the short term.   Indeed there is no certainty that even in the longer term the situation will greatly improve there is thus a risk that short term relief measures could becomepermanent.4.     Among the measures which have been suggested foralleviating the situation are either finding new sources of funds for lending by building societies, or allowing them toraise their investment rate while protecting mortgagors from snincrease in the mortgage rate, or a combination of both.
Hew sources of fundsIf yt - ,.     \5. These include(a) Direct Exchequer loan.   To provide the societies with adequate funds could add up to  1OOra a month (or more if the netoutflow continues) to public expenditure and the public sector. /borrowing requirement, //&apos;   &apos; fur      -     -(b) Borrowing from abroad.    This could probably be arranged,though it would undoubtedly displace public;sector borrowers andwould require exchange cover - at present confined to the public sector. A Treasury guarantee of principal and interest (for whichthere are no powers at present) might also be necessary in orderto keep down the cost and- to avoid damage to the publicforeign currency borrowing programme.     The cost includingexchange cover would     probably be about 13%*   The societiesare examining a proposition but see it as no solution to the short term problem.(c) Funds from the banks.   To be negotiable with the banks thefinance for such lending would have to be exempted from the 8%Vsupplementary control&quot; limiting the growth of interest-bearingliabilities; and would have to be for a short and finite period..Monetary controlZmight be impaired./Releasing special deposits for on-lending to the societies wouldbe no better: in any case these will almost certainly be requiredto enable the banks to meet the essential credit needs of industry.(d) Funds from institutions^   This possibility is being examined(confidential)
(^confidential;by the societies in the context of the proposed Housing FinanceAgency.   But an arrangement could notbe negotiated with the institutions in the immediate future.6.    All these propositions would involve a marginal increase in the mortgage rate unless the lending were to be subsidised becausethese funds would be available at 13$-15$ against the 10.5$ whichthe building societies could afford to pay with a mortgage rate of11$.    Furthermore there would be complex problems of allocation asbetween individual societies./Direct Subsidy7. This would enable the societies to raise their investment ratewithout raising their mortgage rate.   To hold the mortgage rate by1% below what would be required by any given investment rate would cost about  12m a month.   It could be achieved either by a straightcash subsidy (similar to thr  15 million &quot;bridging grant&quot; of lastyear) or by a reduction in the composite tax rate.   The latter wouldbe less flexible and more difficult to withdraw.   Either would incresthe public sector borrowing requirement, and the relief would beindiscriminate.     The subsidy could, of course, be reduced if reliefwere confined to recent purchasers.   It would be impossible tobased on meansoperate an equitable method of selection^because societies have no information on current income of existing mortgagors.Other possibilities(a)     Rediscounting facility8. The societies might be enabled to maintain lending by running dowtheir liquidity in the context of an offer by the Bonl-: of England(confidential)
(^CONFIDENTIAL jto replace a given proportion of the liquidity of societies if it foilto a specified level, on the transfer to the Bank of mortgage assets of the same value.    This &quot;rediscount&quot;&apos; facility might be limited to a specified maximum figure eg   00m.    Since a reduction in liquidityinvolves the sale of public sector debt the adverse monetary effectswould be the same as an exchequer loan but would not count as public expenditure.    Moreover if the societies were unable to restoreliquidity when a total discount facility was exhausted, the Bankwould either be left holding long&apos;term mortgage securities or theGovernment would have to provide the societies with funds torepurchase them.    Apart from the technical problems involvedbuilding societies would be unlikely to accept voluntarily such anarrangement as it would imply detailed agreement on such matters as the minimum level of liquidity, the pace at which liquidity isrun down and the volume of new lending, for each individual society,(b)     Tiered deposit rates.9* The building societies are currently examining the case foroffering more competitive investment rates for term deposits.Allowing for some switching of existing investments, this might enable them to attract additional finance (though almost certainly not on the scale envisaged) at a cost which would imply a mortgagerate of only 12%.   If this proved to be the case, the societieswould almost certainly be prepared to shield less well off first timepurcv asers to some extent by launching the deferred payment mortgagesche e worked out in conjunction with the previous administration.They might also - but this is less certain - be prepared to rephasemortgage repayments in such a way that the current outgoings ofexislting mortgagors need be no higher than at present,   it is even less certain that they would be ready to offer deferred paymentsmortgages to second time purchasers taking out new mortgages.CcONFiDE confidential  j 5&apos;
CONCLUSION(confidential)10.   Unless the budgetary measures improve the competitive position of the societies, or there is an early and sharp reductionin market rates of interest, the only certain way of ensuring thatbuilding society outflow is halted and reversed would be to allowsocieties to increase their investment rate.   All of the propositionsfor providing new sources of finance for societies (eg from theexchequer, the Euro Dollar market, the clearing banks or by a discount facility from the Bank of England) would be, in addition tothe particular difficulties indicated above^ essentially &quot;topping-up&quot;measures which would not remove the need for an increase in the investment rate.   The building societies are very likely to take thisview themselves and it would be difficult to guarantee a standstill on building society rates on the basis of loans or a discountfacility-11.    Consequently, if the investment rate is increased and Ministersdecide that nevertheless the mortgage rate must be kept down this can only be guaranteed by a subsidy (a grant or reduced compositerate of tax).    The cost of a subsidy would depend on its extent.   Ifthe aim is to end the mortgage famine societies might have to offertiered deposit rates which imply a mortgage r a te of as much as \%,This would involve a subsidy of  2lj.m a month to keep the mortgagerate at 11$ for all building society mortgagors.    If hox^ever the aim is only to turn the outflow of funds into a modest inflowwithout ending the famine, this might- involve tiered deposit rateswhic i imply a mortgage rate of only 1 2$.   This would involve a subsidof  jl m a month, to keep the rate at 11$ for all building societymortgagors.    The cost could be reduced if existing mortgagorswere! not subsidised - for example, the cost would be about  3ma month if the&quot; normal mortgage rate went to 13$* for existing
(confidential)mortgagors but was kept to 11$ for new first time purchasers only;or about  1.5m &amp; month if the normal mortgage rate went to 12$ for existing mortgagors but was kept at 11$ for new first time purchasers only.12.    If Ministers decided that societies should attempt only tostaunch the outflow of funds by making the minimum increases in investment rates, the flow of mortgage funds could still be improved if at the same time measures for tapping new sources of funds were pursued urgently as a first step towards introducingmore stability into mortgage finance for the longer term.I!13*    however, e&apos;ven with these new sources of finance there isno assurance that the market position of societies could soimprove in the foreseeable future that they could safely reduceinvestment rates to a level which corresponded to a mortgage rateof only 11$.    In this case the Government would have to continuethe subsidy indefinitely or agree to an increase in the mortgagerate when the subsidy is taken off.
