ICHANNEL tunnel memorandum by the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentINTRODUCTION1. We need to take decisions on the Channel Tunnel and on thelegislation which will be necessary if it is to go forward.background. The present project has been developed on the basis of theagreements reached in 1966 between the Prime Minister and M Pompidouand between the then Minister of Transport and M Pisani.3.        The scheme envisages the provision of a rail Tunnel betweenCheriton near Folkestone and Frethun near Calais, providing for boththrough railway traffic and a ^ferry service&quot; for road vehicles betweenspecial terminals near the portals.    Under present arrangements thefinance would all be raised privately by the British and French ChannelTunnel Companies, at least 10 per cent at risk and the rest as loans backed by guarantees from the Governments.    The Tunnel would be built by theCompanies and handed over to the Governments for operation by a joint anglo-French Authority.PRESENT POSITION4. On 17 November 1973 a Treaty between the two Governments andthe main Agreements (Agreements No 2) with the Companies were signed.This ended Phase I, the period of studies, and initiated Phase II, whichis expected to last until about July 1975.    The necessary powers were provided in the Channel Tunnel (Initial Finance) Act 1973.5.        In Phase II, trial borings and final design work are being undertaken.    A review is being made of the traffic, revenue, cost, andfinancial forecasts in the light of experience and of developments over,for example, the changed energy situation.    The cost of Phase II is some 30 million, all of which is being raised privately, but  22 million isguaranteed by the two Governments.OUR GENERAL ATTITUDE6. The scheme is basically that of the previous Labour Administration.Our attitude in Opposition was that we were not opposed to a Tunnel inprinciple.    We accepted that it would be both commercially attractive andC(74)8 COPY NO    ?319 March 1974CABINET
a sensible economic proposition for the nation in total transport terms,and also something which could bring great benefits to British Railways.We were, however, concerned that the scheme as it has evolved appearedto give too much emphasis to the &quot;rolling motorway&quot; concept as againstthe through rail services, especially in the light of changes in the energysituation since the White Paper-was published, and that the actual termsnegotiated gave inadequate recognition to the return due to the Governments,who would be guaranteeing the bulk of the funds.7.        If we want a Tunnel, then we must accept that it can only be on thelines of the present scheme with such modifications as we can agree withour partners.    It has taken more than seven years to get this far from the1966 agreement.    If we abandon: the present project, there would be no prospect of putting another together for many years, if at all.8. Phase II, moreover, creates an opportunity for a reassessment ofthe project and the financial terms as between the two Governments and thetwo Companies.    Between now and early in 1975 we can explore how far the project could and should be modified on the lines of our thinking when in Opposition, and I shall then be in a position to put forward an assessment.9.        I therefore propose that Phase II should be allowed to continue, butthat the review of the project should be of a more fundamental characterthan that envisaged by the previous Government,    This will not prejudice our position if we decide not to go ahead with Phase III,    To abandon now would cost the United Kingdom Government  8^ million (as against between 13 million and  22 million if we were to abandon at the end of Phase II).An abrupt termination, apart from losing us the chance of substantialfuture revenue and of saving real resources as compared with other methods of cross-Channel transport, would create a major crisis with theFrench Government at a time when we may want to keep our powder dryfor a battle over Concorde.    It would also damage British Railways1prospect of obtaining a major increase in long-distance traffic; the threerail unions, who are agreed on this subject if little else, would bebitterly angry.    There would also be substantial problems, includingenvironmental ones, in providing for the cross-Channel traffic in otherways, especially if Maplin is cancelled.LEGISLATION10,       If it had been possible, I would have wished to hold back fromlegislation for the time being.    Unfortunately, however, we must introduce a Bill fairly soon if we are to keep open our options over Phase III of the project.    The crux is that the Treaty between the two Governments whichwas signed last year is due to be ratified by 1 January 1975.    To ratify the Treaty does not commit us to Phase III, but if we do not ratify by1 January 1975 or, by agreement, soon afterwards, we shall in effect have abandoned the project unilaterally.    Before we can ratify, we have to take powers (for example over lands and works) to enable the Tunnel to. be constructed and operated, and this means a major hybrid Bill, which willtake some time to pass through all its stages.    The position over legislation is well known to the French Government and the Companies.    If, therefore,legislation is not introduced quickly, the other parties will reach theconclusion that we intend to withdraw from the project.confidential
11.        The necessary legislation was introduced in November 1973, butfell with the Dissolution except for a limited carryover in respect ofPrivate Bill procedures and petitions should it be reintroduced in the sameform.    The substantive arrangements are in the Treaty and Agreements.The Bill is in the main a series of largely technical provisions.    indeed the existing Bill, was and any replacement could be, drafted in deliberatelywide terms.    Its passage would not tie us to all the details of theii   arrangements or inhibit any improvements in the Treaty and agreement which we could negotiate with our partners.12.       Any legislation must be introduced by May at the latest.    To delayuntil November 1974 would put the whole project in jeopardy.: 11&apos;.-13.       There are two ways in which the necessary powers can be obtained:a. We could reintroduce the existing Bill, while making it clearthat we would wish to make a number of amendments to it.    Thiswould be done on the grounds that it is the only way to avoid the costs of the local authorities, amenity interests and others whohave petitioned, being thrown away.    It would have the incidentaladvantage of saving us both time and money involved in complying with the Private Bill Standing Orders from scratch.    We should beable to make those amendments we want without conflict withStanding Orders as they are not likely to be of a &quot;hybridising&quot;nature, but this will have to be confirmed when I have examined the Bill in detail.    And it would incidentally assist the passage ofthe Bill by making it more difficult for the Conservatives to opposeit, either on the Floor or in Committee.b. We could introduce a new Bill.    This would avoid some embarrasment, but would have no other advantage if, as webelieve, any amendments we are likely to want could be made tothe existing Bill.CONCLUSION14.       I invite my colleagues to agree:a. that Phase II of the Channel Tunnel project should continue;b. that the Minister for Transport should examine urgently the adequacy of the Phase II reviews including those of the traffic and revenue forecasts (and their impact on the provision to be made forvehicle ferry services) in the light of the new energy situation, witha view to discussing any changes which might prove necessary withthe French Minister and the Companies;c. that we need not seek to re-open the financial terms at thisstage, as they are due to be reviewed in any case in the early months of next year;d. that the Minister should explore with his colleagues on theContinent how to develop the through rail services to the maximum;and3
e.        that, to keep our options open, the necessary legislation should be introduced by May at the latest.    Unless it provesimpossible to make desirable amendments within the terms of thePrivate Bill Standing Orders, the existing hybrid Bill would be reintroduced to save the Petitioners&apos; costs, and the necessary amendments would be made in Committee.ARCDepartment of the Environment19 March 1974/4
