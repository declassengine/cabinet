CABINETSOCIAL SECURITY ACT 1973 - INTERIM ACTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. We have to decide very urgently what to do about the social security Act 1973, which is due to come into force on 6 April 1975.2. We are pledged to replace the Act by our own proposals and wehave undertaken to bring these forward in a White Paper as soon aspossible.    But with the best will in the world we are faced with an interim period lasting for several years before our own pension schemetakes effect.3. In this interval we must create a situation in which we move asnaturally as possible on all fronts towards our long term proposals.    Ihave filled in the background in Annex 1 to this paper, but the essentialfacts are these.    The earnings related contributions structure of the basic scheme is in line with our own proposals; and now that we havehoisted the basic pension up to our own level of commitment we can buildon this our own proposals for earnings related benefits.    The difficultylies in the second pension arrangements, particularly the reserve scheme,which is completely out of line with our proposals and has been stronglycondemned by the TUC.    We have three choices for the interim period -to keep the reserve scheme as it is, to make it a pay-as-you-go scheme,or to postpone its introduction.    But in each case it is essential to considerthe effect on the separate problem of financing the deficiency in the basicscheme after April 1975.    This deficiency results from the  10/ 16 pensionwe are introducing, and is of the order of  700 million to  800 million in1975-76 on the level of contributions laid down under the 1973 Act(see Annex 2).OPTION A4. We could keep the reserve scheme exactly as it is and defend thison the basis that we inherited it, tha^ to alter it now might create difficulties for employers and those running occupational pension schemes,that it is better than nothing and that it will only run for a short time before.our long term proposals take over.    We should have to give tax relief on the employee^ contributions to demonstrate that we were1C^24 ,,      &apos;     COPY NO     ?5 April 1974
changing the one thing that was open to us to change, and to redeem what we all said in Opposition; and also to help meet the strong criticism wecould expect, for example, from the TUC.    It would be necessary to do something about the Reserve Pension Fund when our new proposals came into effect - either continue it to service the accrued benefits until theyhad all been paid out many years ahead, or make equivalent arrangements.5.        With this option, the range of choices for financing the shortfall inthe basic scheme lies between the two extremes of meeting it all by asubstantial increase in contributions, or meeting it all by an increase inExchequer supplement.    The financial implications are described in annex 2, but if there were to be any increase in the employee^contribution to the basic scheme, in addition to his having to pay for thereserve scheme, this would produce some very large increases indeed(see Table 1).OPTION B6. We could put the reserve scheme on a pay-as-you-go basis anddivert the contribution income to the basic scheme (but still give tax relief on employees&apos; contributions).    This would mean a short butcontroversial Bill, which would also replace the system of bonuses(there would be no invested fund to supply them) by price dynamism.The guaranteed reserve scheme benefits would be paid exactly as laiddown, but as these build up very slowly, practically all the income wouldbe available for basic scheme benefits for many years.    The financial implications are described in Annex 2.7. This course would probably be accepted by the TUC as the best that could be done in the circumstances.    On the other hand the occupational pensions interests and the Parliamentary Opposition wouldargue that private schemes cannot, in general, match price dynamismand would attack strongly the move away from funding.    It should benoted however that good occupational schemes (for example, those basedon final salary) already provide pre-award dynamism in excess of priceprotection.    More generally, the main danger of this course is that weshould be accused of raiding, for general use, a Fund designed to producepensions for those who have contributed to it.OPTION C8.        We could postpone the commencement of the reserve scheme, andtherefore of the second pension arrangements generally (other thanpreservation) by revoking the Commencement Orders, and announce thatwe intended to repeal the Social Security Act when our long term proposalscome into force.    This would avoid legislation on the reserve scheme, andthe revocation order could not be prayed against (though no doubt someonewould find a way of raising it in the House).    Postponement woulddemonstrate our dislike of the reserve scheme and people would not havethe difficult choice of whether to contract out or not in the interim period.2 y&apos;: &quot; .
3But there would be protests about postponement at this late date whenpreparations were far advanced, and there would be criticism of the factthat people not in occupational pension schemes were being left forseveral years with no build up of earnings related pension.9. The shortfall in the basic scheme would remain to be dealt with(see Annex 2).    If it were met by increasing the employee&apos;s contributions by 0. 6 per cent (with proportionate increases for employers and theExchequer), this would mean that some women, including some withlower earnings, would have further substantial increases as from april 1975, as compared with the rates introduced in August 1974.(see Table 2).    It would be necessary to find some other way of financing the deficit which avoided this difficulty, for example, by increasing the proportion paid by employers or the Exchequer.CONCLUSION10.       None of these courses is free from difficulty.    But I think that on balance Option C is the best, provided only that some method can be found of avoiding unacceptable contribution increases for the lower paid.Subject to this, I ask my colleagues&apos; agreement that I should state, before easter, our intention to drop the reserve scheme, and all the secondpension arrangements that go with it, (except the requirement for prese*rv!ngoccupational pensions on change of employment, which would remain).BAG,; -ii -Department of Health and Social Security5 April 1974
CONFIDENTIAL !ANNEX 1THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT 19751.   The Social Security Act 1973 has three main elementsx-(a) the basic scheme of flat rate pensions for earnings related contributions;(b) the &quot;second pension&quot; arrangements for earnings related pensions from either recognised occupational schemes, or from the state reserve scheme;(c) preservation of occupational pension rights for early leavers.2.   The basic scheme can be allowed to run from 6 April 1975* subject to what issaid elsewhere in the paper.   The preservation arrangements can also stand, withoutprejudice to later improvements which may be decided.3.   The arrangements for recognising occupational pension schemes are in effectgeared to the level of the state reserve scheme which broadly speaking determinesthe lowest level of pension acceptable.   The reserve scheme is therefore the keyto the second pension arrangements.4* From the Government!s point of view the reserve scheme, whioh has been stronglycondemmed by the T.TT.C, has the following shortcomings.(a) It is a money purchase scheme with poor benefits at older ages.(b) There is no provision for accelerated maturity to help older workers.(c) It is a funded scheme, so that the contributions are saved up for alifetime and are not available to help current pensioners.,(d) It has no guaranteed dynamism, but only a promise of &quot;bonuses&quot; based on investment performance which may well not provide price protection.(e) There is no Exchequer subsidy or tax relief on contributions.(f) There are differential rates for women.The Government&apos;s long term pension plans5.   There is already agreement with the T.U.C. on the broad outlines of policy.These are now being looked at in the Department of Health and Social security and it will be a little while before they can be finalised and put before ministers collectively.
But the main underlying principles are clear(i) There should he a state achene of earnings related pensions with afloor of  10/16, for those with a full contribution record, adjustedby reference to earnings, (or prices, if this proved better) andwith a redistributive element to assist the lover paid;   the aim should be to take as many people off supplementary benefit as possible,and existing pensioners should be &quot;credited in&quot;;(ii) the financing should be on a pay as you go basis, with an exchequer supplement, so that the existing generation of pensioners can get theimmediate advantage of contributions currently being paid, and the taxpayer can bear his share;(iii) there must be some form of accelerated maturity for older contributors;(iv) there mustWbe equality for women;/(v) there must be a role for occupational schemes, whereby people in good schemes pay less to the state scheme and have a corresponding reduction in their state pension.The transition from the 1975 Act to the Grovemmenfs long-term proposals.   The Social Security Act 1973 increases the level of employee contributions to that visualised in the former Grossman scheme in exchange for inferiorbenefits.   The Grossman scheme proposed earnings related contributions of 6f%for non-contracted out employees and 7% (with no upper earnings limit) for employers.   Under the 1973 Social Security Act employees will pay 54% and employers 7l% (but with the same upper earnings limit as employees) towards the basic flat rate pension giving a total of 12f%*.   To these figures would beadded (for those not in recognised occupational pension schemes) 1t$ and 2lf/orespectively towards the reserve soheme:   a total of 6 % and 10% or l6f% in all.Employees and the trade unions would therefore if the reserve scheme is retainedhave become accustomed to paying higher contributions for a scheme which is unsatisfactory from their point of view, and should be willing to pay theappropriate contributions for better benefits when the (Jovemmenfe own longterm proposals for a fully integrated pay-as-you-go scheme with an 18% exchequer contribution come into effect.* This includes 1% for the National Health Service and 0.2% for the RedundancyFund.   These contributions will yield substantially more than the presentflat rate contributions (mainly from employers) but are a common feature ofall the options considered in the paper.
ANNEX 2jasiclichemeieserveliehemeIfor those not con-Iracted out)Financial Implications1. The financing of the Social Security Act, 1973 (for employees)is as follows:- !Percentage contribution up to1-jb; times national average earningsEmployee&apos; 2/0EmployerExchequer^%/of contribu-tion incomeJ7UsePay-as-you-goFunded and investedby independent BoardNotes1.     The percentage rates of 5i% and       will be variable by Orderup to -J%, and by legislation over that amount.2.     For employees in recognised occupational schemes there are noreserve scheme contributions; the recognised scheine may or maynot require contributions from the employee, n     I3.     The Reserve Pension Board (which has already been appointed)has no limitation placed on its power of investment exceptthat it must not hold as much as 10% of the share capital ofa quoted company.   No estimate can be made of the proportionit would invest in British Government Securities; the levelof such investment in non-insured pension funds generally isof the order of 10% (for insured schemes it is somewhere between10% and 20%).Income in 1975/762.     The income to the basic scheme in 1975/76 will be lower than in a normal year, because the changeover to a fully PATE system will take somesix weeks or so to show its full effect.   If this abnormal lag isignored, the income from the basic scheme rates of contribution set out above will still be very substantially below what is needed to finance the  10/16 pension and subsequent increases in line with earnings.On the basis of various assumptions, including the assumption that themaximum earnings limit will be raised to  66, the shortfall in 1975/76,ignoring the lag, will be of the order of  700 million to  800 million,equivalent to about 1-J% on the joint contribution or a total of 14i%instead of 12f%, for the basic scheme.   Moreover the deficiency would.
CONFIDEMY8ALgo on increasing in line with earnings.   But the injection of additionalincome equal to       of earnings would he likely to keep the positionfairly stable for some time to come.   This extra money could be raisedby additional contributions, by Exchequer support, or by divertingreserve scheme contributions.   These possibilities have to be looked at in conjunction with the three choices on the reserve scheme specifiedin the paper.3.    As for the reserve scheme itself, estimates of its income are subject to very wide margins of error, because there is no way ofsaying how many people will come into the reserve scheme.   The original estimate was 7 million members but the latest estimate is 9 millionmembers giving an income of  630 million ignoring the lag effect and making the same assumptions as for the basic scheme.4.    Against this background the financial implications of the threeoptions are set out below.Option A    (Reserve scheme unchanged; tax relief on employees contribu-tions; basic scheme income to be increased).(a) Tax relief on employees  contributions to the reserve scheme would cost about  70 million on a membership of9 million.(b) The income of the basic scheme would have to be increased substantially.   The range of choices for achieving thiswould lie between the following two extremes.(i) The shortfall in basic scheme income could be metentirely from increased contributions, attractingthe corresponding Exchequer supplement.   The necessary1-J% increase, split between employee and employer inthe same proportion as the existing Social Security Actcontributions, would result in an additional 0.6% forthe employee and 0.9% for the employer, resulting intotals of 5*85% and 8.4% respectively (compared withthe       and l^/o in the Act).   The effect of such anincrease at various levels of earnings for employeesis set out in the attached Table 1.   Clearly increases of this kind would be liable to press very hardly onthe lower paid, particularly those in the reserve scheme.(ii) The shortfall in basic scheme contributions could bemet entirely by increasing the Exchequer support tothe basic scheme by the amount required (of theorder/of  700 million to 800 million).   This wouldmean an effective Exchequer supplement for 1975/76of about 33% compared with the 18% provided for inthe Act.
Option B     (Reserve scheme contributions diverted to basic scheme,attracting Exchequer Supplement, but reserve scheme benefits remaining,with price dynamism; tax relief on employees&apos; contributions).(a) Tax relief on employees&apos; contributions - financial effect as above.(b) Price dynamism would not add significantly to costs forthe next decade or so.&apos;(c) The diversion of the reserve scheme contributions would(on the assumptions set out&quot;above) produce about  630 million.As these contributions would be used mainly to pay basicbenefits, they should attract the same Exchequer supplementas the basic scheme contributions, producing a further 110 million, giving a&quot;total of  740 million, or aboutenough to meet the shortfall.(d) This would leave the basic scheme contributions at thelevel laid down in the previous Government&apos;s Act, in spiteof the  10/16 pension.Option C     (Postpone reserve scheme; basic scheme income to be increased).(a) The income for the reserve scheme would be entirely lost(and no liability for reserve scheme benefits would accrue).(b) The problem of financing the shortfall in the basic scheme would remain, and there would be the same range of choicefor producing the extra income as in Option A above.   Theeffect of adding as much as 0.6% to the employee&apos;contribution, in the absence of a reserve scheme, is shownin Table 2 attached.   Clearly some way would have to befound which avoided imposing unacceptable contributionincreases on the lower paid.
