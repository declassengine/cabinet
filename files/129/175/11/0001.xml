C(74) 11 COPY NO20 March 1974CABINET76REPEAL OF THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ACTIIMemorandum by the&quot;Secretary of State for employment. I attach a note (Annex A) intended as the basis of consultations with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI) on the repeal of the Industrial Relations Act.    Annex Bsets out the provisions which I propose to include in the Bill to repeal theIndustrial Relations Act.2.        Our first consideration is the need, impressed upon me in everytalk with the TUC, to secure the repeal of the Act at the earliest possible moment.    Indeed *hey think the speedy timetable which we propose is alltoo slow.    But it is the fastest we can envisage.SCOPE OF THE bill .        We have examined thoroughly the proposals contained in the draftBill prepared on the basis of documents agreed by the TUC-Labour PartyLiaison Committee.    The Bill was of considerable length (over 60 clausesand several schedules) and we have reluctantly concluded that a numberof important provisions included in it must be left over for the ensuingEmployment Protection Bill if we are to achieve our aim.    I have explained this to the TUC and they recognise the need to keep the Billshort, particularly in the present Parliamentary situation.CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION SERVICE W4. The principal omission is that the Bill will not provide for theestablishment of the Conciliation and Arbitration Service on a statutory basis.    This will substantially reduce the length of the Bill.    It would inany case be difficult to include it in a Bill immediately, because of theneed to work out the scheme in consultation with the TUC, CBI and other organisations.    But, as the note points out, we need not wait for legislation before setting up the Service.    The necessary discussions willbe started as soon as possible.
5.        We propose to defer most of the suggested improvements in theunfair dismissal provisions of the 1971 Act, while making a small numberof relatively uncontroversial changes which will show that we are notcontent simply to continue the existing provisions in their present form.Of course, I shall also make it clear that we intend to undertake a more radical revision at a later stage.THE CLOSED SHOP6. The reference to the closed shop (paragraph 14(b) of Annex B)will certainly stir up controversy.    This is a natural consequence of abolishing the so-called &quot;right not to belong&quot; introduced by the 1971 Act.However, it does raise the question of safeguards against arbitraryexclusion or explusion, which has been touched upon by the Lord chancellor and the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection.    Suchsafeguards were recommended by the Donovan Commission and there is astrong case for them on merits.    On the other hand a proposal to introducethem would be resisted by the TUC.    The alternatives are to includesuitable safeguards in the Bill or to leave them out in the expectation thatthey will be written in during its passage through Parliament.LEGAL IMMUNITIES7. The proposals about legal immunities follow closely the proposals put forward by the TUC and agreed by the TUC-Labour Party liason committee.    They do, however, contain some provisions which are likelyto be controversial - in particular the protection for persons inducingbreaches of all types of contract, including commercial contracts.    Theproposals will be criticised, both in Parliament and elsewhere, on theground that they would give wider immunities than existed before the 1971Act.    Nevertheless I think we should include them, but there might be some room here for concessions.PICKETING8.        Another controversial proposal is the extension of the protection for peaceful picketing to allow pickets to stop vehicles.    The LordChancellor has suggested that this might be deferred until the next stage.I can see the advantages of this, although it is a point to which the TUCare likely to attach considerable importance, and I am strongly in favourof keeping it. 11    &quot;TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS9. The Lord Chancellor has commented on the problem of what to do with National Industrial Relations Court (NIRC) cases not disposed of whenthe Bill comes into force.    There is no easy solution to this.    To stop suchcases in their tracks would arouse tremendous controversy.    To allow the2
NIRC to complete unfinished business would not be tolerable to our supporters, or compatible with the aim of getting rid of the Court as quickly as possible.    There remains the possibility of transferringunfinished cases to the High Court or the Court of Session.    Though notideal, this seems to be the course open to least objection.TIMETABLE10.       I want to move heaven and earth to introduce the Bill on 1 May,although we must recognise that this will allow very little time for consultation. )11.        Subject to my colleagues&apos; agreement I propose to send theattached notes, Annexes A and B, revised as necessary, to the TUC andCBI and a small number of other organisations immediately, asking fortheir comments within two weeks.    In doing so, I will explain that because of the need to introduce the Bill very quickly, full consultationis not possible at this stage; there will, however, be ample scope for theBill to be fully scrutinised and amended, as necessary, during its passage through Parliament.    I would not propose to publish the note orto make it available to the Press.M department of Employment19 March 19743
.   ANNEX ALEGISLATION TO REPEAL THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ACT1.      The Governments objective is to get a Bill repeaJ.ing theIndustrial Relations Act introduced and passed through parliament as quickl;/ as possible.    This necessarily limits the scope andcontents of the present Bill.    The Government  ire committed to introducing a second measure,  provisionally entitled The EmploymentProtection Bill,   and the need for speedy repeal of the industrial relations Act means that some desirable changes must be deferredand included in this later legislation.2.      The provisions which it is proposed should be included in the repeal Bill are summarised in the Annex to this note  (Annex B).3. (    It is proposed to defer to the second stage the establishmentof an independent Conciliation and Arbitration Service on a statutory basis.     This will allow time for details of the scheme to be worked out \\rith the TUC and the CBI,   and for other necessary consultations which will inc3.ude representatives of Departmental staff who mayform part of the new Service.4.      It will still be possible for a start to be made by bringing the CAS into  existence administratively in advance of legislation.Statutory functions  could be added later.    Deferment does,  however,mean that some functions proper to the CAS would have to beundertaken temporarily by other bodies.Repeals5.      The whole of the Industrial Relations Act would be repealedexcept for the provisions relating to unfair dismissal which willbe amended.Trade Unions and Employers&apos;  Associations6.      Iii place of registration the Bill provides for a system of voluntary certification for trade unions and employers associations.     It is proposed that the certification function should,
for the time being,   be given to the Registrar of Friendly Societiestogether with the oversight of annual returns and accounts.     ThatRegistrar performed similar functions under the pre-1971legislation.    The functions would be transferred to the CAS when itis set up as a statutory body.7.      Tax relief on provident income would be available to  allorganisations registered under the pre-1971 legislation and toother organisations  certified as trade unions by the Registrar of friendly Societies as indicated above.Restrictions on legal proceedings and colieetive labour relations8.      These provisions would restore and extend the pre-1971 legalimmunities for trade unions and &apos;individuals uacting in contemplationor furtherance of a trade dispute.    In particular the immunitywhich existed before 1971 for persons indticing breaches of contractwould be re-introduced and extended to all types of contract(including commercial contracts).    The Bill would also reverse the&apos;        .    ii      .i.rpresumption in the 1971 Act as regards the legal enforceability of collective agreements.Unfair dismissal9.      The main substantive changes proposed in the provisions ofthe 1971 Act are as follows:(a) Reduction of the qualifying period from 2 years to one.(b) Extending the time limit for complaints from 28 days to6 months.(c) Raising the compensation limit to allow for the fall inthe value of money.(d) Making it clear that-the doctrine of &quot;constructivedismissal&quot;  applies to the provisions of the Act.
(e)    Providing automatic protection against dismissal forbelonging to,   or taking part in the activities of,   anindependent union,     except where a closed shop exists;and against dismissal for refusing to belong to anon-independent union.10.    Several other changes have been proposed by the TUC.    these will be considered for inclusion in the second Bill when a muchmore radical revision of the unfair dismissal provisions will beundertaken. //Transitional arrangements11.    There is no feasible way of stopping proceedings already been launched under the 1971 Act before the Bill comes into force;this applies equally to proceedings started before the presentation of the Bill and during its passage through Parliament-    But casesstill before the NIRC when the Bill comes into force would betransferred to the High Court or the Court of Session.    The bill will also provide that no further cases arising from provisions which are to be repealed could be brought after the Royal Assent,even though the matters complained of related to the period whenthe provisions were enforced.ii
ANNEX   BI PROVISIONS OF THE BILLIntroductory1. It is proposed to repeal the whole of the Industrial relations act 19715 with the exception of the unfair dismissal iDrovisionswhich will be retained with amendments.Trade Unions and Employers1   Associationsi2.      The definition of trade union would follow that in the labour government&apos; s 1970 Bi.ll.    It would differ from the previousdefinition in the Trade Union Act Amendment Act 1876 and the TradeUnion Act 1913 in excluding employers&apos;   associations and includingthe trade union sides of Joint Negotiating Committees and the TUGitself.    Employers&apos;  associations would also be separately defined as in the Labour Government&apos;s 1970 Bill.3.      There would be no  system of registration,  but trade- unions and employers&apos;   associations would be able to apply to the registrar of Friendly Societies  (RFS)  for a certificate as to their status.All trade unions which were registered under the pre-1971legislation,  together with those who obtain a certificate from theRFS, would be entitled to tax relief on provident income.4.      The Bill would provide that the rules and purposes of tradeunions and employers&apos;   associations should not be unlawful by reasononly that they ai-e in restraint of trade;    and the legal protection given by Sections 2 and 3 of the Trade Union Act I87I1  andsubsequently by Section 135 of the 1971 Act, would be continued onthat basis. , .     r . - -5.      Trade unions and employers&apos;  associations would be unincorporatebodies with power to sue and. be sued in their own names.6.      It is proposed that unions should be empowered to  &quot;unscramble1funds which have been accorded protected status in order to preclude
their use as compensation under the 1971 Act despite provasionsto the contrary in their rules.7.      All trade unions and employers&apos;   associations, whether certifiedor not,  would be required to keep proper- accounts,  to send to theRF.S an annual return and accounts,  and to make copies of their rulesavailable to any person on request:.    These provisions are on the lineset out in the Labour Government&apos;s 1970 Bill.    It would1be an offence not to comply with the; provisions.8.      The functions under the Trade Union Act 1913 in regard to tradeunion political funds and under the Trade Union  (Amalgamations etc)Act I964,   at iiresent exercised by the Registrar of Trade Unions and employers&apos;  Associations,  would revert to the Registrar of friendly societies.9.      The functions allocated in this part of the Bill to the registrar of Friendly Societies would be taken over by theConciliation and Arbitration Service when the latter is set up asa statutoi-y body.Restrictions on Legal Proceedings and Collective Labour Relations ----.... ,----- .............. o , 1.- .  .. ....   ,10.    These provisions would restore the pre-1971 legal immunitiesfor trade unions and individuals acting in contemplation orfurtherance of a trade dispute,  and extend them in certain respects.11.    The proposals are as follows:(a)    The definition&quot; of trade dispute in Section 5(3) of theTrade Disputes Act 1906  (which was repealed by the 1971 Act)would be revived and modernised in the light of recent caselaw.    Disputes over union recognition and disputes where one party- accedes to the demands of the other would now be coveredby the definition,  as would disputes outside Great Britain.
(b)    Protection against action for civil conspiracy would begiven to persons combining together to further their legitimateends in a trade dispute.    This provision    would be substantially the same as Section 1 of the Trade Disputes Act 1906  (see alsoSection 132(3)&apos; of the 1971 Act).\(c)    The immunity which existed before 1971 for personsinducing breaches of contracts of employment would be restoredand extended to all typesu of contract.(d) The present protection for peaceful picketing  (Section 13,&apos;iof the 1971 Act) would be re-enacted and extended so as to, allow pickets to obstruct the highway to the extent reasonably necessary to  enable them to communicate with persons either in vehicles or on foot.(e) The prohibition of actions for tort against trade unionswhich existed before 1971 would be restored and extended totorts threatened 01- apprehended in the future.(f) The provision in Section 128(1)  of the 1971 Actprohibiting any court from ordering someone to work would bere-enacted.(g) The Bill would provide that no injunction should begranted ex parte in a trade dispute unless all reasonable steps have been taken to notify the person or organisation against whom the injunction &quot;is sought and an opportunity given to themto make representations.12.    The Bill would provide that collective agreements should be presumed to be intended to be legally enforceable only if they arein writing and contain a provision to that effect.    Disputesprocedures are not to be implied to be part of the individual contraof employment unless this is expressly stipulated-in the relevantcollective agreement.
kl&apos;3f*    It is proposed to  continue the unfair dismissal provisions ofthe Industrial Relations Act with certain improvements.ik.    The principal par-provisions to be retained are Sections 22-32 ofthe 1971 Act.    The main changes in these provisions would be asfollows:(a) Section 23 would be amended to make it clear that    /constructive dismissal  (ie where the employee is justifiedin terminating his contract because of the conduct1 &apos;of the employer)  can provide grounds for a complaint of unfairdismissal.(b) Sections 2*1 (ft), 26(3) and 29 (l) would be repealed and replaced by a new provision which would make the followingautomatically unfair:-;! (i)    dismissal cf an employee for belonging to,  or taking part in the activities of,  an independent. trade union,   except where under a collectivea        agreement or arrangement the employer is-entitledto insist that all employees belong to a particular-independent union;(ii) dismissal of an employee for refusing to belong to a union that was not independent.It would be fair to dismiss an employee for refusing to belong to an independent union where that unions had a closed shopagreement or arrangement.(c) It would be provided that an independent trade union is one not s\ibject to interference by any employer either-by ray of financial or other material support with theobject of affecting its functions or administration,  6r byway of actual domination or control.
(d) Section 28 would be amended to provide that those employed for at least 52 weeks  (at present I04 weeks)  could lodgecomplaints about unfair dismissal.(e) The exemption procedure for voluntary agreements contained^    in Sections 3-1  and 32 would continue but applications wouldbe made to  the Secretary of State instead of to the NT.RC.15.    In addition:(a) The present basis for awarding compensation would beretained but the upper limit of  4160 in Section 1.18 of the197-1 Act would be raised to take account of the fall in thevalue of money.(b) The time limit laid down in Schedule 6 within which complainthave to be made would be extended from 28 days to 6 months.l6. A more radical revision of the present unfair dismissal provisions would be undertaken in later legislation.17.   A number of siipporting provisions in the 197-1 Act would need tobe attained in whole or in part,   in some cases with amendmentso    they include the following:Section. 100    (extended scope of industrial tribunals)&quot;        106    (complaint to  industrial tribunals)1 i ------     .        ...      $ -    % K , &apos; .   I      .!!.,;;   -Si     -&quot;        116 &amp; 118    (compensation)&quot; 146 (conciliation officers)&quot; 148 (teachers)&quot; 149 (Race Relations Act-)&quot; 150 (redundancy payments)&quot; 151 (period of continuous employment)&quot; 159 (National Security)&quot; l6l (restrictions on contracting out)
Section 162(Employment under the Crown)itI63(regulations etc)11164(financial provisions)167(definition of &quot;dismissal&quot; etc)Schedule 6(Industrial Tribunals)l8.    Steps will be taken,   in consultation with the TUC,   to inci-ease..    .-. isubstantially the number of trade unionists serving on the industrial11tribunals.    This is not,  however,   a matter which needs to be dealtwith in the Bill itself.19. With the abolition of the NIRC, appeals on points of law from thedecisions of industrial tribunals on unfair dismissals and redundancy payments would revert temporarily to the High Court or the Court of session.     There would be provision for the Court to be assisted byassessors with industrial  experience.     It is intended in laterlegislation to set up a new appellate body with a legal  chairman andlay members from both sides of industry.Mis cellaneous  and SupplementaryIncorporated bodies.    There will have to be some provisiondealing with registered trade unions and employers1  associationswhich were incorporated under the 1971 Act.    Their status will be assimilated to that of all other trade unions and employers&apos;   associatioiin that they will become unincorporated associations.21.    Terms   Conditions of Employment Act 1959.     Section 8 of the Actwill be re-amended so  as to enable all trade unions,   as defined in theBill,  to bring claims under the Act.&quot;&apos;-   Claims will continue to bepossible in respect of workers whose remuneration or minimum &apos; remunerativeis fixed under the Wages Councils Act 1959&quot;
22.    Transitional provisions.    These will need to deal with unfinishedI business arising from  sections of the 1971 Act which are to be repealed,(a)    Provision would be made for cases not yet being heard by theNIRC when the Repeal Bill comes into force to be dealt withby the High Court or the Court of Session,(by    The Bill would provide that no further cases arising fromprovisions which are to be repealed could be brought afterthe repeal takes effect,   even though the matters complained of related to the period when the provisions were in fo.rc.Oc(c) As l-egards xmfinished cases referred to the CIR by the NIRCthe CIR would be required to report to the Secreta:ry of,      State instead of to the Court.(d) Complaints, about breaches of the guiding principles or of union rules which are being dealt with by the Registrarwhen the Repeal Bill comes into force would &quot;be transferredto  an industrial tribunal.commencing  em ent23.   A commencement order will be made as soon as possible after theRoyal Assent effectively repealing most of the provisions of the1971 Act  (other than those dealing with unfair dismissal).2&apos;l.   Repeal of the provisions which establish the CIR as a statutorybody (mainly Section 120-123 and parts of Schedule 3) may need to bebrought into effect somewhat later.    It is envisaged that the CIR&apos;spre-1971 function of promoting good industrial relations will in due course be taken over- by the CAS.     Those provisions would,  therefore,be repealed at a time which takes  account of the progress made withsetting up the CAS  as well as  the need  to  allow the CIR to  completeiorit already in hand.
25.    The functions of the Industrial -Arbitration Board will  also betaken over later by the CAS so that the bringing into effect of the repeal of Section 12k of the 197-1  Act  (which gives the Board itspresent name)  should similarly be timed in relation    to theestablishment of the CAS.
