THE PRINCE OF HANOVERMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh affairs at their meeting on 15th May (C.M.(56) 36th Conclusions,Minute 4) the Cabinet  -(1)   authorised the Attorney-General to lodge formalnotice of appeal from the decision of the courts of Appeal on the claim of Prince Ernest of Hanoverto British nationality, and(2)   agreed to resume at a later meeting their discussionof the question whether to proceed further with this appeal.i2. Notice of appeal was duly given on 15th May.It may be convenient to set out my reasons for thinking thatthe appeal should be pursued.3. If the decision of the Court of Appeal stands, I do not thinkthat it will be possible to avoid legislation.    This is not because of theexistence of about four hundred extra British subjects (although a conservative Member of Parliament has put down a question asking if legislation will be introduced to limit them), but because the effect ofthe decision is to cast doubt on the validity of certain marriages onaccount of the Royal Marriages Act, 1772.4. By that Act no descendant of George II &quot;other than the issue ofprincesses who.....marry into foreign families&quot; may marry without theroyal consent.    A marriage celebrated without the consent is void andits issue are illegitimate.5. In several instances consent has been regarded as unnecessarybecause the person concerned was the issue of a princess who had marrieda man who was considered at the time to be a foreigner but who, as aresult of the Court of Appeal&apos;s decision, was a British subject.Prima facie the decision means that consent ought to have been given and that as it was not given the marriage was void and the issue wereillegitimate.    Among other results, interests in property under settle-ments may be affected.6. A claim to British nationality has already been made onbehalf of a German princess on the basis of the recent decision;  theclaim directly raises fee Royal Marriages Act point and will have to be answered.COPY NO.secret.P.(56) 1335th June, 1956CABINET
7. I doubt if publicity about the Royal Marriages Act point willbe avoided when the case ceases to be sub judice, as it will do at onceif the appeal is abandoned.    The giving of notice of appeal has been announced in the Press.    Further, even if public interest dies down itmay revive at any time, e.g. in connection with rumours about intendedmarriages.8. The Lord Chancellors view that the marriage of a princessto a person who was a British subject only under the Act of 1705 was nevertheless a marriage into a foreign family if the husband&apos;s family wasin substance a foreign one would make legislation unnecessary.    But itseems unsafe to rely on this view.    The Lord Chancellor himselfrecognises that the courts may not accept it;  and the Law Officers inFebruary, 1955, took the view that a marriage to a person who was aBritish subject under the Act of 1705 is not a marriage into a foreignfamily.    There are families which have been living abroad for fourand five generations and which are British under our ordinary nationalitylaw;    Though their domicile, associations and even language may beforeign, they are regarded by us as British and not foreign and it seemsdifficult to say that they would be foreign families for the purpose of theRoyal Marriages Act.    British nationality under the Act of 1705 shouldnot differ in principle for this purpose from British nationality underthe ordinary law.9. Past practice under the Royal Marriages Act has been on thebasis that marriage to a British subject is not marriage into a foreignfamily, and publicity has been given to this in an article in Burke&apos;sPeerage.10. Legislation might give rise to considerable controversybecause it would provide an opportunity for discussion on the questionwhether the out of date Royal Marriages Act should be amended andthis might provide an opportunity for discussion on royal marriagesgenerally.    It v/ould also probably require consultation with the self-governing countries of the Commonwealth, and corresponding legislation might be necessary in those countries.11.        If an appeal to the House of Lords succeeds, no difficultywill arise and no legislation will be necessary.12.        Even if the appeal fails, I think it would be easierpolitically to consult the Commonwealth countries and introduce thenecessary legislation after the legal issue has been settled by a decisionof the House of Lords.G. LL. -G.Home Office, S.W. 1..4th June, 1956.
