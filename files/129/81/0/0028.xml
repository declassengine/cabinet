SECRETCP. (56) 12826th May, 1956CABINETCROWN PRIVILEGEMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and national insurance in C. P. (56) 127 me Lord Chancellor reports the conclusions onCrown Privilege of a Committee of Ministers, which was itself appointedto consider the report of a Committee of officials on this question.2.      An important section of the officials&apos; report dealt with social security records, including addresses, medical reports, welfare reports and other personal information contained in the National Insurance, warpensions and National Assistance Board records.    I understand fromthe minutes of the Ministerial Committee that some consideration wasgiven to certain of these issues.     The Lord Chancellor in his reportdoes not specifically refer to them, but they are involved in paragraph (d)in the Annex to his report and are affected by the matters dealt with in(b) and (c) of the Annex.3.      It has been for over forty years the practice and policy to preserve the confidentiality of social security records and claim Crown Privilegewhere it has been necessary to do so for this purpose.     The question of whether any modification of this policy, both as regards Crown Privilegeand otherwise,  should be made, raises extremely difficult issues onwhich controversy is growing.    I have had to answer Questions from several Members of Parliament on the subject of the refusal by myDepartment to disclose addresses of National Insurance contributors toaggrieved persons, including deserted wives, and there was, not long ago, correspondence between my predecessor, the Attorney-Generaland the President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, inconnection with a claim of Privilege on the same subject.4.      I have in course of preparation a paper for circulation to mycolleagues dealing with the whole subject, of which the issue ofclaiming Crown Privilege in such cases is a part.    I am thereforeanxious that the statement to be made by the Attorney-General on the^Report Stage of the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill should not prejudiceany decisions that may require to be made when that paper isconsidered.    I hope it may be possible to draft the Attorney-GeneraPsstatement in such a way as to leave these issues open, and in particularmat it should not commit us to any general propositions which may prove to be inconsistent with whatever course is finally decided upon.COPY NO.
5.      I am also concerned, in this connection, with the question of the disclosure of medical reports made in connection with war pensionclaims, sickness benefit, and industrial injuries.    I assume that the documents which it is proposed in (b) of the Annex to C, P. (56) 127 shouldbe disclosed, are to be disclosed only in connection with claims againstthe Department or doctor concerned, and not in connection with proceed-ings between other parties.6.      I am also concerned with the question whether reports byunofficial welfare officers organised or employed both by the Sailors&apos;,Soldiers&apos;and Airmen&apos;s Families1 Association (S.S.A.F.A,) and a largenumber of other voluntary bodies should or should not be made thesubject of claims for Privilege.    I hope, therefore, it may not benecessary to includ&apos;e in the Attorney-GeneraPs statement any conclusion on the point raised by the Secretary of State for War with respect toreports by S.S.A.F.A.J.A.B.-C.Ministry of Pensions and national insurance, W. C. 2.25th May, 1956.
