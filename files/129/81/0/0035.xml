(this Document is the property of her britannic majestyts government)secretcp.(56) 1355th June, 1 956.SCHOOL BUILDINGM emorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer feel difficulty about the Minister of education s proposals in C P. (56) 134.2. In round figures there is  90 millions of school building workwhich has been approved by the Government, but which has not yet been started.     This consists of  32 millions which was not started in 1955/56,and  57 millions which was approved as the programme for 1956/57.3. The Minister proposes to start  85 millions of this  90 millionsduring the 18 months ending 30th September, 1957.    He would present thispublicly as a six months extension of the 1956/57 programme period inorder to get rid of the heavy arrears.    He would then say mat, as onlyhalf of 1957/58 remained, only  3 0 millions, or half the normal rate ofstarts, would be authorised for that period.4. In my view the economic situation makes it necessary to spreadthis  90 millions of starts over two years, instead of over 18 months, insome such way as this:-Value of Work to be Started  m.1956/57 1st half       302nd half       201957/58 1st half       202nd half       205. The difference between these two proposals is that the Ministerwishes to start  5 millions a month on the average over the two ye?.rperiod.     This is more than the average monthly rate of starts in 1955/56,which was  4.6 millions.    I should like the rate of starts restricted to under  4 millions a month, so that we have a rate below that in 1955.This would give us a real contribution to lowering inflationary pressure.6. Of course there are difficulties.    Under my plan there willbe less accommodation in secondary schools in 1958 than under theMinister&apos;s.     This is the year when a large increase in the annual intakeis expected.    But part of the Minister&apos;s programme is for &quot;rural re-organisation&quot;, and this could be delayed.     We could not present my plan to the public as merely a rephasing of the programme.     Last autumnthe Prime Minister said in Parliament that the school building programme would not be cut.     In February we said that we would adjust this year&apos;scopy no.CABINET
programme to make room for the carry over from 1955/56.    under my proposal we should have to say that we are reducing the programme.7. We ought to give local authorities clear guidance now as towhat the programme is for 1957/58, So that they can make their plans ona firm basis. It would be much better, I think, to take a bold decisionto keep the programme down. If the situation improves radically more could be added later for the second half of 1957/53. For this we shouldbe able to take credit.. But if, through over-optimism, we now try to dotoo much, we shall only have to escape from our commitments, withloss of prestige.8. All the symptons are that we are not doing enough to securedeflation.    I shall have to ask all my colleagues to maintain, and probably to intensify, the present restrictions on investment for a further period from this autumn.    In my view primary and secondary school buildings should make a bigger contribution than the Minister offers.     Less shouldbe started than in 1955, not more.    This is the more necessary asbuilding for Technical Schools will be increasing.H.M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.T.4th June, 1956.
