oSECRETC,P. (56) 12215th May, 1956COPY NO,CABINETPERSIAN GULFNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in connection with recent discussions on Bahrain, I circulate forthe information of my colleagues a paper prepared in my Department, whic;deals factually with our position and problems in the States of the persian gulf.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1.14th May, 1956.PERSIAN GULFAN ANALYSIS OF OUR POSITION AND problems the nature of our position the States of the Persian Gulf, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and the seven Trucial Shaikhdoms, differ in wealth, degree of advancement andpolitical characteristics;  but our constitutional relation with them all is broadly the same.    They are independent Arab Shaikhdoms under Britishprotection and linked to Her Majesty&apos;s Government by a number of treaties and undertakings given at various times since 1820 by and to theirRulers.    The principal rights and responsibilities which make up our special position are:-(i)    DefenceAssurances have been given to the Rulers of Bahrainand Qatar that we will protect them against external aggression.     There is no specific obligation towardsKuwait or the Trucial States though this obligation couldbe said to be implicit in the fact that these States arerecognised to be under our protection.
n o0 0(ii)    The exclusive agreements with the Rulers whereby theyhave undertaken not to communicate with foreign Govern-ments except through Her Majesty&apos;s Government.    Onthe basis of these agreements - which are broadly thesame for all the States - we conduct their foreign relations for them.-(iii)    Extra-territorial jurisdiction, which we exercise byagreement with the Rulers.    This varies from State toState, but in general it covers British subjects and all foreign nationals except Arabs.(iv)    Oil agreements the Rulers have undertaken not to grant oilconcessions without our approval (the undertaking in thecase of Kuwait is loosely worded and an effort made in193 5 to get it made more explicit was unsuccessfulexcept in respect of the Kuwait/Saudi Neutral Zone).On the strength of these agreements we regard assubject to our approval the terms of oil agreementsconcluded by the Rulers;  we also conclude PoliticalAgreements with the oil companies concerned, which provide inter alia that the companies shall conduct their relations with the Rulers on policy mattersthrough our Political Agents.(v)    AviationBy special Air Navigation Agreements with each state having an airfield we have (a) control over trafficrights;   (b) facilities for the R. A.F. ;   and (c) in Bahrainand Sharjah only, responsibility for the operation of the airfield.(vi) Other agreements with the Rulers provide for theprohibition of the import of arms and of the slave tradeand the operation of postal services by the G. P. O.2.      Except in one or two specific matters, such as arms and slavery,we have no right to intervene in the internal affairs of the States and wecan influence them only:-(a)    by proffering advice.     The Political Agent in each territory sees the Ruler frequently and this accessis an important part of our position;   and(b)    through the British Advisers and employees of the rulers.     (in Bahrain and Qatar but not in Kuwaitthe Administrations are headed by British Advisers.In all three States numbers of British officials and experts are employed.)Our capacity to direct the internal Governments of the States is thus strictly limited.    We can impose our wishes in internal matters only if we areprepared to resort to force.    But we have an ultimate responsibility to restore law and order if a security situation beyond the control of thelocal police arises.     This is recognized by the people.    In that the
o q0territories are British Protected States (they are so designated by Order inCouncil) we are also liable to be held generally responsible before world opinion for all that goes on in them.    In a sense, our position is thus oneof responsibility without authority.    We have also to face the fact that military intervention by us, even at the request of the Ruler in order toassist him in restoring law and order, would be liable to land us in continuing commitments of an internal character.    Intervention againstthe Ruler and in support of reform would involve us in assuming an overtly,!Colonial&quot; role,  since we should almost certainly have to instal a newRuler and establish his authority under British control.     This would createvery great difficulties for us throughout the Arab world.    It would give a propaganda handle to hostile outside influences such as the Egyptians.Our Objectives3.      Our main purpose in the Gulf is to ensure fair access to the oiland stable conditions for its production.    This makes Kuwait by far themost important to us of the territories concerned, of which the statisticsare as follows:-State    PopulationKuwait    250, 000Bahrain 120, 000Qatar        25, 000Trucial    90, 000StatesAnnual oil production(million tons)605NilOil Interests50% British50% American100% American23. 75% British23. 75% American23. 7 5% Shell(Anglo-Dutch)23. 75% French5% GulbenkianAs QatarStateRevenue(  millions)10038Insignificant4.      The dangers from which our oil interests have to be protectedare:-(i)    political disturbances or a breakdown in security which would impede oil operations;(ii)    the emergence of hostile regimes which might seekeither to impose difficult conditions on the oil companies or to nationalise them.5, This therefore involves our other main objectivesi which shouldbe:-(i)    to preserve internal security and to promote good government,  social progress and economic development in the territories;(ii)    to retain the goodwill of the Governments and peoples of the States.
so6,     Our special responsibilities and position are only of use to us in asfar as they serve these purposes.    They are not to be preserved or extender,for their own sake.The Possible Threat7.      Our ability to use Our position for these purposes is liable to be impaired in the following ways:-(a) by the Rulers and their Governments succumbing tothe xenophobic influences of Arab nationalism,particularly from Egypt, and turning against us;(b) by the degeneration of administration in the hands ofan irresponsible ruling family into misgovernment ofthe kind prevailing in Saudi Arabia;(c) by the Rulers (upon our individual relation with whomour position depends) losing their authority toreformist or revolutionary movements which might,on gaining power, reject the British connection;(d) by the encroachment upon, or absorption of, the territories by their neighbours, particularly SaudiArabia.These possible developments could of course merge with one another.But in general the danger of (c) is at present more apparent in Bahrain,of (a) and (b) in Kuwait, of (a) and (d) in Qatar and of (d) alone in theTrucial States.The Present Situation8. The Gulf States are not as far down any of these paths as is sometimesimagined.    The elements of the present situation are as follows.9.      The Rulers of all the States and the majority of their subjects donot oppose the British connection as long as it does not infringe tooobtrusively upon their independence, their convenience and their conception of themselves as good Arabs.     Moreover we have on our side theconsciousness, in the Rulers if not in the more volatile of their subjects,that they owe the independent existence of their States to our protection.This is a vital factor which differentiates the Gulf from the normal pattern of political development in other dependent territories..10.    The oil companies are able to operate satisfactorily and the irrelations with the Governments are generally good.    Even in Bahrain,where the political situation is disturbed, there has been no serious threat to or interruption of oil operations.11.     The States are undoubtedly and inevitably subject to the influence of Arab nationalism of the particularly virulent kind manufactured in Egypt.They cannot be insulated against it.     The main threat is not so much fromthe Egyptian teachers and experts employed by the Governments (thereare numbers of these, mostly in Kuwait, but they are not in a position to influence policy) as from the general psychological impact of Egyptianpropaganda and prestige.    It is difficult for us to compete in this field
of &quot;Arab&quot; thought where immoderation against the West is politically-conventional and any attempt at counter-attack can be represented asunrespectable &quot;imperialism&quot;.    The attitude of the Rulers of the threenorthern States is one of neutrality combined with adherence to the british connection.     They are not receptive of any attempt to get them to takesides against Egypt (this applies particularly to Kuwait and Qatar - the ruler of Bahrain stands more closely at our side but has to reckon withan active opposition which looks towards Egypt).    But at the same time they are not at all disposed to allow the Egyptians to interfere in localpolitics or in the independent government of their States.     The Saudiruling family they hold in some veneration and they are carefully neutralabout the Buraimi question;   they prefer to avoid joining issue with the saudi Government about anything and are content to shelter behind the&quot;exclusive&quot; arrangement if there is any negotiating to be done.    BothSaudi Arabia and Egypt are now working more openly against us in theGulf than formerly but there is little indication either of concerted effortor on the other hand of any rift in the Egyptian-Saudi axis.     The Saudi aimis probably to win the Rulers away from us, while the Egyptians concentratemore upon encouraging &quot;progressive&quot; elements opposed both to theexisting regimes and to their connection with us.Kuwait12,    In Kuwait the Ruler and his family are jealous of their prerogativesin internal affairs and resent anything that looks like interference on our part.    The Government Departments are headed by shaikhly and oftenirresponsible Ministers;   and there is consequently some mis-management and lack of direction, particularly in development planning.    But despite this, the large oil reserves are mainly used for social development, and adequate reserves are invested in London.    The local security forces are thick on the ground and well armed.    For this reason and becausethe ruling family are well entrenched, the people too prosperous for political passion, and there is no communal basis for opposition as inBahrain, serious agitation against the present system of government isfor the present unlikely.Bahrain13,    In Bahrain a similarly autocratic but much better administration has for long been run principally by the Ruler&apos;s British Adviser,Sir Charles Eelgrave, with British officials at the head of the mainGovernment Departments (except Education).    The Ruler, who isobstinate but our firm friend, is now faced by a widely supported oppositionmovement which is firmly based on a wish for a more representativeform of government, the traditional distrust of the Shia half of thepopulation for their Sunni Rulers, the pusillanimous neutrality of theimportant merchants, and the appeal of Arab nationalism.     Thoughoccasionally the reformists adopt an anti-British tone their movementprimarily aims at the reform of the Bahrain Government;  they havelooked to our support in this and they do not seem to dispute that we havea role to play in the affairs of Bahrain.    They do not openly attack theBritish connection.    Their strong opposition to Sir Charles Belgrave is directed against the system of rule he personifies and concentrates inhis own hands rather than against him as an Englishman,    Nevertheless,he has become focus for hostility and while he remains in Bahrain thereis a serious danger both that tension will increase and that these feelings of hostility will be turned against Her Majesty&apos;s Government.     The Ruler,
hilargely at our instance, has taken some steps to broaden the basis of his administration.     The accommodation he reached with the reformists afterthe disturbances in March was reached through the mediation of our representatives.    It has not proved complete, but without their inter-vention the situation might have become entirely out of hand.    TheBahrain State Police, though lately improved under the command of an experienced British Commandant, are not capable of dealing with seriousdisturbances.     An open collision between the Bahrain Government may atany time cause a situation in which British troops would have to be usedto restore law and order.Qatar14.    Qatar has the same high national income from oil in relation topopulation as Kuwait, though on a much smaller scale;  but the Ruler&apos;british Adviser and British Government officials are able to ensure that development is well planned and the administration reasonably efficient.There is as yet no local opposition to the regime.    The Police, under aBritish Commandant and officers, and well armed, are capable of dealingwith any threat to the regime.    Their only difficulty might be the Ruler rsreluctance to allow them to act against his own subjects.The Trucial States15.    The Trucial States are far behind the three sbaikhdoms bothpolitically and economically.    Outside influences are far less felt.    the role of the &quot;dowlah&quot; or State, as Her Majesty&apos;s Government are calledthere, is unqestioned.    Our only present problems are those caused bySaudi expansionism - to protect the States and to show the population (mostof them materially-minded bedouin) that the &quot;dowlah&quot; is worth theirallegiance.14th May, 1956
