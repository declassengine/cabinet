Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1956SECRET Copy No.  g 2CP. (56) 10120th April, 1956CABINETRENT RESTRICTIONMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentLast October, when approving my proposals for the reduction of subsidies onCouncil houses, the Cabinet instructed me to include in my statement to parliamentary reference to rent control on the following lines:  &quot; The Government recognise that the level of rents of Council houses andthat of comparable privately-owned houses are interrelated. It is therefore necessary to review the whole structure of the Rent Acts. We shall annouce our conclusions in due course.&quot;(CM. (56) 36th Conclusions, Minute 7.)2. Thereafter, the Prime Minister appointed a Committee of Ministers Minister of Housing (Chairman), Secretary of State for Scotland, Minister ofAgriculture, Minister of Labour, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Solicitor-General and Financial Secretary. Treasury with the following terms ofreference:  &quot; To consider what modifications should be made to the Rent RestrictionActs and to report to the Cabinet.&quot;Except for a few outstanding points of detail, the Committee have completed the irreview of the problem, and their conclusions are set out below.Present Controlled Rents3. There are about 13 million houses in England and Wales, of which nearly10 millions come within the scope of rent control. Of these, about 5 millions arelet unfurnished at controlled rents.  The remainder are mostly owner-occupied.4. The controlled rents differ widely. Those of many of the older houses are based on the rents charged in 1914, with an addition of 40 per cent. The rentsof the remainder are mostly restricted to the levels prevailing in 1939. Some rentshave risen following the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954; but the effect ofthat Act, which was aimed primarily at allowing &quot; repairs increases,&quot; has not beengreat. Furthermore, there are, for a number of reasons, glaring variations betweenthe controlled rents of comparable houses.Objectives of Policy5. The Committee have reached the conclusion that the Rent Acts should be amended without delay. The objective should be to get housing progressively onto an economic basis, and in particular (a) to allow landlords to charge rents which are sufficient to enable them tokeep their houses in good repair;(b) to encourage landlords to re-let houses when controlled tenancies cometo an end, instead of putting them up for sale as they nearly alwaysnow do;(c) to induce people who are living in unnecessarily large rent-controlledhouses to move to smaller houses;id) to remove anomalous variations between rents of comparable houses; and(e) to create ultimately a free market in houses to let.49824
Main Provisions of bill. It is not considered feasible to abolish rent control immediately. On theother hand, the rents of houses which continue to be controlled should be allowedto rise up to prescribed ceilings more nearly approaching economic levels andfixed on a uniform basis.7. The Committee accordingly recommend that a Bill should be introducedembodying the provisions set out below:  (a) New maximum controlled rents (exclusive of rates) should be&quot; establised for all rent-restricted houses and should be calculated by reference tothe gross rateable value of the house.(b) Landlords should be permitted to raise controlled rents up to an amountnot exceeding twice the gross rateable value of the house. (The reasonfor doubling the figure is that houses are assessed at 1939 values.)(c) In order to avoid unduly sharp increases, rents should be raised in twoor three stages. (It is suggested that in the first stage the increase shouldnot exceed Is. 6d. or, alternatively, 10s. 6d.)(d) Where the landlord fails to maintain the house in proper repair, the tenantshould be entitled to claim a reduction of rent. Disagreements betweenlandlord and tenant about repairs should be referred to the localauthority, with a right of appeal to the Courts.(e) No rent increase should be permitted for a house which is subject to ademolition or closing order, or is in a clearance area.(/) A house in owner-occupation or of which the owner obtains vacantpossession should be released from rent control.(g) The Minister should be empowered to lower, by Order from time to time,the ceiling below which the Rents Acts operate, and thereby release acategory of houses from rent control.8. The general effect of these proposals upon the level of rents is shown inthe Annex. It is estimated that the rent increases involved would raise the newCost of Living Index by not more than two points.Timing of Legislation9. Assuming that the permitted rent increases were applied in two or three stages, their full impact would not be felt for twelve to eighteen months.10. In order to give sufficient time for tenants to get over their initialannoyance and for the beneficial effects of the policy to become evident before thenext General Election, the Committee strongly urge that the measure should been acted at once.11. Parliamentary Counsel has completed a first draft of the Bill, which couldbe ready for presentation to the Legislation Committee before Whitsun.Recommendation12. The Committee accordingly recommend that a Bill, embodying theprovisions summarised in paragraph 7, should be introduced as soon as possible with a view to its passage during the present Session.D. S.Ministry of Housing and Local Government,Whitehall S.W.1.19th April, 1956.
EFFECT UPON RENTSThe general effect of increasing rents to twice the new gross rateable value isshown below. (These tables do not include the \ million restricted houses in theCounty of London, for which figures are not yet available.)(a) The new maximum rents (exclusive of rates) would be for 1,250,000 houses up to 11s. 6d. a week,,   1,000,000 lls. 6d. to 15s. 6d. a week850,000    ,,     15s. 6d. to 20s. a week,,   1,000,000    ,,     205. to 30s. a week500,000    ,,     above 305. a week.(b) The maximum increases in rent would be for 1,000,000 houses up to 55. 6d. a week1,000,0001,100,000850,000370,000170,00050,00055. 6d. to 75. 6d. a week75. 6d. to 105. 6d. a weekIO5. 6d. to 155. 6d. a week155. 6d. to 205. a week205. to 305. a weekmore than 305. a week.2. If, in the first stage, increases of up to 75. 6d. a week were permitted, the rents of some 2 million houses (including London) would reach their new ceilingsat once, or about 3\ millions if a limit of IO5. 6d. were adopted.3. It should be emphasised that the figures given above are maxima. For thegreat majority of houses the effect would be smaller than the amounts quoted.
