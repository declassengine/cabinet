Q-9SECRETC.P. (56) 123 COPY NO.16th May, 1956CABINETKARIBA HYDRO-ELECTRIC scheme memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues should be aware of the situation to which the attached report by officials draws attention.    It is proposed that, following earlierunderstandings, we should now agree to make available from the UnitedKingdom loans to the total of  28 millions.    Against this sum it isestimated that United Kingdom firms are likely to get direct orders to thevalue of about  15 millions.2.      This is a very disappointing result.    Although our prime reasonfor entering on this investment has been in pursuit of our policy for helpingCommonwealth development, we have always made clear our interest that united Kingdom firms should play a substantial part in this very importantproject.    The Federal authorities have been fully aware of this and haveindeed amply demonstrated that they would like to place their orders with us;  moreover, our people have enjoyed the advantages of British consulting engineers, British standards and Imperial Preference.    We accepted thatthe contracts should be placed on the basis of international tendering,chiefly because the financial support of the International Bank was required.3.      When the result becomes known, there will undoubtedly be aconsiderable outcry and we shall be asked why we did not tie our loans toBritish goods and services.    The President of the Board of Trade and Ibelieve that we should have a good defence on this point, both because thebulk of the money we are lending is required for local expenditure (sinceInternational Bank money is not available for this purpose) and because it can be argued that we get advantages from free international competition in contracts of this kind.    In so far as we can show that our firms havebeen beaten in fair competition, we can hold the position, particularly since we can point to the substantial opportunities which this vitaldevelopment of the Federation will bring to our industry.4.      We should, however, be in much greater difficulty if it could be shown that contracts had been secured by foreign firms with the help of subsidies.    No question of a subsidy appears to arise in the case of themain civil engineering contract for which an Italian firm is the lowestbidder.    The question does arise, however, in the case of two othercontracts;  those for the transmission lines (valued at about  10 millions)and for the turbines (valued at about  1 million).5.      For the transmission lines contract the two lowest tenders arefrom Italian firms, and the third from a South African firm with Italianconnections.    We suspect, but are not yet in a position to prove, that the
Italian firms are enjoying a subsidy.    We are trying to ascertain the factsbut it is clear that the subsidy element is not enough to account for thedifference between the Italian bids and the rest.    Moreover, if the Italianfirms were eliminated because of the subsidy the contract would go to aconcern which might get its pylons from Italy.    The best of the purely british bids is much too high to come into consideration.6.      On the contract for the turbines the lowest bid is from a Britishfirm who are most unlikely to be excluded.    The second best is from a french firm who enjoy the benefit of a price variation guarantee from theFrench Government, in addition to the remission of the French social welfare charges in respect of their export business.7.     I have considered whether we should try to secure the general agree-ment of all concerned (i. e. the Federation authorities and the international bank) that subsidised bids should be excluded.    Although, as I have shown,the practical advantage to us in this case might not be very great, it wouldbe a demonstration of the importance we attach to the elimination of export subsidies and show that we had introduced a valuable safeguard in agreeing to provide capital for the project.    We are, however, up againsta number of difficulties:-(a) There is an important time factor in that our agreement to make our money available and to guarantee the Bankloan is required within the next few days if theFederation authorities are to be in a position to let the main contract in time to take advantage of the nextdry season.    If this is missed the whole project willbe held up for at least a year.(b) The International Bank will find great difficulty in agree-ing to outlaw subsidy arrangements unless they can be shown to have been internationally condemned.    (TheFrench Government subsidies have been given a further period of grace in the Organisation for european economic Co-operation, and the fact that there is an italian subsidy has yet to be proved.)    Moreover itwill be some weeks before the technical examinationof the tenders is complete and the full facts about thevarious bids are known;  in these circumstancesargument on these cases with the Bank will inevitably lead to delay.(c) It would be most difficult for us to link the question of subsidies with our agreement to release  10 millions.We have already told the Bank that the precise amount would be governed by our general policy towards suchreleases.    This policy enables us to insist that about three-quarters of the release should be spent in theUnited Kingdom.    We haze not, however, hithertoclaimed to impose a veto on subsidised bids.
8,      Because of these difficulties and since we are likely to get theturbine contract in spite of the French subsidy, while the Italians seem likely to get the transmission line contract even discounting the subsidyelement, my view is that we should agree to give the consents required toenable this project to go ahead.    At the same time, however, I think weshould make clear, both to the International Bank and the federal authorities, our view that a contract should not be awarded to a firmwhose bid is better than the next solely because of a subsidy.H.M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.16th May, 1956.
FEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NYASALANDKARIBA HYDRO ELECTRIC PROJECTReport by OfficialsRepresentatives of the Federal Government have for thepast two weeks been in London completing their negotiationsfor loans with the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment (I.B.R.D.), Colonial Development Corporation(C.D;C.) and Commonwealth Development and Finance Corporation(C.D.F.C).      Provided that no unforeseen snags arise in thefinal stages with the I.B.R.D. in Washington, and providedthat the United Kingdom Government can give such clearancesor authority as are required from it, the way is clear forthe completion of the loan arrangements.      Our own talks withFederal officials have also reached the stage when decisions should be taken on the points which need to be settled beforethe United Kingdom Government can indicate formally its willingness to go ahead with the loans and to give the other authorities required.Decisions required, of the United Kinp;dom Government2.      In order that loan negotiations may reach finality, theUnited Kingdom Government, if the existing plans are to go forward, is required:-(a) to indicate that it is prepared to give capitalsanction to the C.D.C. loan of  15 millions, when-ever this applied for;(b) to indicate that it is prepared to give consentunder the Control of Borrowing Order to an npplica-tion by the Federal Power Board to borrow  3 millions from the C.D.F.C.(c) to inform the I.B.R.D. that it is prepared to guarantee the I.3.R.D. loan of  28 millions to theFederation (which the latter is only able to borrowby virtue of United Kingdom membership of the bank and supported by our guarantee);(d) to confirm that it is prepared to release up to 10 millions of the United Kingdom sterling sub-script ion to the I.B.R.D. towards the Bank&apos;s loan of  28 millions.Conditions to be satisfied before agreement3.     Four formal conditions to the United Kingdom contributionwere laid down in a letter from the former Chancellor of theExchequer sent on 17th February, 1955 to Lord Malvern, thePrime Minister of the Federation;    and there are two furtherconsiderations which are of considerable importance, although not written in as formal conditions.     The position on eachof these six points, and our recommendations on them arereviewed below, taking first the two points which, while notformal conditions, are of most significance to us:-(i)    United Kingdom Share of Orders1+.     This project is a large one, and has inevitably attractedmuch publicity in the United Kingdom.     The substantial degreeof United Kingdom participation in the loans and the prestigeattached to the gaining of the contracts will mean that
United Kingdom industry, which has had the project underreview for some time, will he watching closely for the results.Should United Kingdom firms &quot;be unsuccessful in gaining orders,there is bound to be much criticism;    and even though this criticism may he to some extent uninformed or unjustified,Ministers will wish to bear in mind that it is likely to besevere.5.      It was made clear to Lord Malvern in the talks with theformer Chancellor in February, 1955 that the United Kingdomattached considerable importance to a fair proportion of the contracts coming to the United Kingdom, and Lord Malvornrecognised our interest.     But we did not tie our offers of loans to expenditure in the United Kingdom.6.     Within the last fortnight, information has been obtained on the volume of business that is likely to be awarded to united Kingdom interests.     This information has been madeavailable on a personal basis &quot;by Federal officials and mustbe treated as highly confidential.     The details made knownto us are set out in the Annex.     From this, it looks as ifthe United Kingdom may obtain around  15 millions of thosecontracts of which details are known, representing possibly 10 millions of external and  5 millions of local expenditure.On top of this are various items that we cannot yet assess,or quantify;    such as tenders not yet in ( 1- 2 millions);British orders under sub-contracts where foreign firms are themain contractors;    and equipment of United Kingdom originbought locally,7.     We have also learnt from these talks with Federal officialsthat on the tenders so far received, the total cost of the project may be some  6-7 millions less than the  79 millions which was estimated;    and that total external expenditure is unlikely to be very much greater than the  28 millions whichis to be lent by the International Bank0     It therefore nowlooks as if the  18 millions from the C.D.C. and O.D.F.C.mentioned in paragraph 2(a) and (b) above would have to beattributable to local expenditures, leaving the I.B.R.D. sloan to cover the external costs, to which it must be confined;and that, of the external expenditure, United Kingdom orderswill account for about one-third.8.     Or, o he question of the release of our sterling sub-scription to the I.B.R.D., our understanding with the Bank isthat  10 millions is the maximum release, and that it should be related to the amount of expenditure in the United Kingdom inaccordance with our normal policy.      It will be some time beforethe Bank are in a position to put before us a formal request fora release of a precise amount, and when that is received, itwill be open to us to make a release of less than  10 millionsif expenditure in the United Kingdom falls substantially below that.9.     On this basis, towards the external costs, we are unlikely to have to release any substantial sum for expendi-ture outside the United Kingdom;    and the loans from theC.D.C. and C.D.F.C. can be justified as going to internalexpenditure.10.    These prospects may not seem very reassuring but theFederation are well aware of the importance we attach to securing as much business as possible for United kingdom interests and have done everything possible to assist us.Although the procedures of the International Bank have imposedselective international tendering, United Kingdom firms have
&quot;been favourably placed in this, since the Consultants whodrey/ up the specifications v/ere British, and used british standards, and Imperial Preference will have given UnitedKingdom tenderers a marginal advantage of some 10 per cent.The Federation will have to justify their decisions on tendersto the Bank, and there is little room for them to give us anyfurther special treatment.      We had hoped that these advantageswould have helped United Kingdom firms to secure a larger shareof the contracts than now seems likely, and there will undoubtedly be much dissatisfaction at the results.     But theprobable outcome is not so unfavourable as to justify ourdamaging our relations with the Federation and the I.B.R.D. by seeking at this stage to qualify or retract our offers ofassistance.     Moreover, the scheme is of enormous importance tothe future economic well being and progress of the Federation.We may in any case look forward to United Kingdom interestshaving a very fair share of the benefits deriving from theincreased economic activities in the Federation which theKariba scheme will make possible.(ii)   Level of general development in the Northern Territories11.    The execution of the Kariba project is likely to affectthe rate and nature of general development in the Federation.This is a question of some political importance to Ministerssince one of the main reasons for which Federation wascommended to Parliament was the economic benefits which itwould bring to the Northern Territories.      It was recognisedat the time of.Federation that special attention would haveto be paid to development projects in Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland if the more uniform level of development throughoutthe Federation was to be achieved and it was assumed at thattime that -che Federal Government v/ould take steps to ensurethat their services would, so far as practicable, be &quot;brought up to and maintained at the same standard throughout theFederation.12.    It must be recognised that the concentration of financialand physical resources at Kariba cannot fail to restrict forthe time &quot;being the Federal Government&apos;s activities in other fields.      It has however been agreed in discussions with theFederal officials, that the Federal Government will be readyto give us assurances that;-(i)    it will be the aim of the Federal Government to ensurethat the demand for local resources does not exceed the supply of these resources and drive up theirprice and that in achieving this balance theFederal Government will use every means within its power, including its ability to control the rateof immigration^(ii)    the Federal Government do not contemplate the curtailment of the existing development plans andintend to proceed at the same general rate duringthe period of construction of Kariba.      But they recognise that some small adjustments- and increasesmay be necessary;(iii)    revenue accruals resulting from copper while the price is over a figure in the   region of  21+0-250 per tonwill bo applied to development purposes andsurpluses as they occur on revenue account willsimilarly be applied.
y 913.    In practice these assurances have the effect of ensuring that, if physical resources are insufficient to carry out all existing plans, it is immigration which will he cut.     nor do they entirely close the door to some increase in general development plans if physical resources allow.     It does not seem possible to go further and actually to insist thatimmigration should be further cut in order to avoid thefalling away in Federal general development which seems likely to take place under existing plans between 1957 and1959.     The Colonial Office however wish to place on record their view that, if the expected falling off in general development takes place, and proves to be due to shortage offinancial rather than physical resources, and if the political repercussions look like being severe, it may be necessary forHer Majesty&apos;s Government to consider the provision of additionalfinance to remedy the situation.     The Treasury has taken note of this view but wishes for its part to place on record that itdoes not regard itself as committed in any way.1U.    Turning to the four formal conditions specified lastyear, the position is:-(i)    That the scheme should be technically soundWe are satisfied that this is so.(ii) That adequate supplies of electricity will beavailable for...tho. copper, companies during theperiod before Kariba comes into productionFederal officials have assured us that the companies aresatisfied that they can make do with their existing, or othertemporary plant, until i960, when supplies from Kariba become available.      We have had no clear confirmation from the coppercompanies themselves on this point but we have been informed by one of the companies that they are taking steps to provideplant in case of shortage.     We conclude that we are entitledto assume from this assurance by the Federal Government, andfrom the action of the companies in making their own plans to fill any shortfall in power, and in contributing to the financing of Kariba, that they acquiesce in the Kariba time-table and in its implications for them.     We consider thatthis condition is met and that no further re-assurance isnecessary.(iiI)    That adequate arrangements will be made for the resettlement of displaced AfricansWe understand that the Federal Government is prepared tomeet the cost of resettling Africans displaced by the Karibaproject.      At present, this is estimated to cost  2,5 millions in Northern Rhodesia and  0,75 millions in Southern Rhodesia,.and provision for these amounts has been, made in the Karibacapital estimates.So far as Southern Rhodesia is concerned,&apos; the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in Salisbury has reported that satisfactory arrangements are in hand, and that the responsi-bility of the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations in relation to African land would probably only be involvedto a minor degree;    the United Kingdom Government can regardits interest as satisfied on this side.h-
May,  1956So far as Northern Rhodesia is concerned, where theColonial Secretary has certain direct responsibilities for african welfare, we are advised that it will not be possibleto determine the full extent of the costs until later (i.e. whenthe maximum level of the lake is known), and it may be thatsome revision might be required.     We have no doubt that theFederal Government regard themselves as committed to meetsuch costs as may be appropriate, but in order to have a formalassurance, we propose that in notifying the Federal Governmentof the main United Kingdom decisions we should record our understanding that the Federal Government regards itself as responsible for seeing that these costs, as finally determined,are met.      The Federal Government would be asked to confirmthis understanding.(iv)    That no loan should be tied to expenditure in any country outside, the sterling areaFederal officials have given their assurance on this andwe are satisfied that this condition is met.Summary15.    To sum up;-(1)    Of the proposed United Kingdom contribution of- 28 millions to this project  18 millions will relateto internal expenditure, and up to  10 millions - theUnited Kingdom sterling release to the I.B.R.D. - willrelate to external expenditure,(2)    On present preliminary information, United kingdom firms look like gaining  15 millions in direct orders,Of this,  5 millions would be internal, and 10 millions external.      In addition, there may beorders under sub-contracts;    some equipment ofUnited Kingdom origin may be bought locally;    and sometenders are not yet submitted.(3)    There is therefore good ground for hoping that theUnited Kingdom sterling release of up to 10 millions will be fully mopped up by expenditurein the United Kingdom, and the release may be lessthan  10 millions if expenditure in the UnitedKingdom falls substantially below that,(h.)    The level of development in the Northern territorieswill be safe-guarded to the extent that is possible at this stage by the assurances which the Federal, Government are ready to give.(5)    Of the four special conditions set down in the formerChancellor&apos;s letter of 17th February,  1955 toLord Malvern, all can be regarded as satisfactorilymet,  subject to obtaining confirmation that theFederal Government will meet expenses at presentunforeseen on the resettlement of Africans inNorthern Rhodesia.(6)    There will be a considerable outory from UnitedKingdom industry if the United Kingdom Governmentagrees to the loans described at (1) above, and ifUnited Kingdom industry gains orders only to theextent foreseen at (2) above.     Nevertheless, UnitedKingdom industry has had more than a fair chance tosecure orders, under the selective internationaltendering made necessary by the substantial I.B.R.D.participation.      There is too much at stake in ourrelations with the Federation and the I.3.R.D. tojustify our withdrawing, or further qualifying, theUnited Kingdom loans.
jlO j.CIVIL......ENGINEERINGThis is made up in part of preliminary contractsalready awarded, to a value of  9 - 10 millions, of which about one-quarter may represent external expenditure, thebalance being expenditure incurred within the Federation;and of the big main contract for work on the dam wall, tothe value of  25 millions of which the bulk will be spent in the Federation.      United Kingdom firms have alreadygained the preliminary contracts, but for the big maincontract, the Italian group r,Impresit&quot;, who have valuableexperience of this kind of construction, have submitted the lowest tender, and their price is subject to relatively noqualifications.      No British firm competed individually forthis contract, but the six other consortia who tendered allcontained varying degrees of United Kingdom participation.Thus the next lowest tender is by the American Utah group,in which the United Kingdom concern, Taylor Woodrow, have about a 20 per cent interest;    and the third lowest came from the Christiania and Nielson group, in which there is some British interest.      The two latter tenders are subjectto some qualifications.      (The bid of the Cementation group in which there was a substantial British element is much too high.)      It seems likely that the Italians will get the contract.      Although no United Kingdom firm alone are indirect competition, there will undoubtedly be criticism ifan Italian group gets the contract.      The contract must be awarded by 15th June if the River Zambesi is to be divertedduring the dry season ending December 1957.ELECTRICAL AND MECHANICAL EQUIPMENTTurbines     Value about  1 million.      Harland (British)are the lowest bidders.      This firm have not previously madeturbines of the size required, but we would expect that having been selected to tender, their impute is not in doubtand they are likely to get the contract.      A French company is next.      The Federal authorities have been informed by thisFrench Company that it is insured by tho French government against price variation.      The Federal authorities have beenput in possession of our information on French subsidypractices.Generators     Value about  1-f- to  2 millions.      the lowest bTd&quot;is German (Siemens), the second is Swedish (ASEA),the third German (AEG) and the fourth and fifth British.But they are all open to serious technical questions, the differences between the lowest and the fifth is only  li+3,000and it is a very open question where the contract might go.There is still a possibility that a British tender might prove to be the best.Transformers     Value about  2 millions.      The fivelowest: tenders are all British.Cranes      (about  107,000).      The lowest bids are British.Reactors      ( 190,000).      The three lowest bids are british.DETAILS OF KARIBA CONTRACTS AS A T PRESENT KNOWN
TRANSMISSION LINESThe value ot this contract is about  10 millions, mainlyexternal expenditure..     The lowest tender is by RhodesianPower Lines, which are a subsidiary of SAE (Italy) and whichare already operating in Central Africa,      The parent firmhave also tendered and are next.      The third is a SouthAfrican firm called Hubert Davies who are  412,000 above the lowest and who are understood also to have some Italianconnection.      They have quoted on two alternative bases,  oneusing Italian steel towers and the other using towers of an american design.      The fourth is Balfour Beatty who are 1,8 3 0,000 above the lowest tender.      It is understood thatthe lowest tenderer probably intends to purchase hisconductors in Sweden, to manufacture che steel pylons in italy and to purchase the insulators and earth wires( 700,000 in all) in the United Kingdom.The Italian Government give a &quot;refund&quot; of customs dutyon iron and steel materials used in the manufacture of mechanical engineering products exported from Italy, evenif the iron and steel used is in fact of Italian origin.The value of this subsidy on the pylons in this contract isabout  220,000.      Our information about this Italian practicehas been given to the Federal authorities.      The UnitedKingdom Embassy at Rome is also being consulted in order to confirm our understanding of what happens as a preliminary to advising the Italian Government of our disquiet at thisapparent export subsidy and inviting their comments.OTHER ITEMSTenders for penstocks, sluice gates, switchgear etc.,estimated to cost between  2 - 3 millions, have not yet beensubmitted.To sum up,  it looks as if the United Kingdom   may obtainaround  15 millions of direct contracts, of which perhaps 10 millions will represent external costs, and  5 millionslocal expenditure.      In addition, there is the possibilityof some share of the penstocks etc., still to he allowed for.Moreover, British, firms may get sub-contracts even in caseswhere foreign firms are successful in securing orders asmain contractors5    also these foreign firms will to someextent use equipment which they obtain locally and which, istherefore likely to he British.
