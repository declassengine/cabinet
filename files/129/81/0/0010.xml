Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1956SECRET Copy No.CP. (56) 1101st May, 1956CABINETMALTAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesThis memorandum is circulated for the information of my colleagues who may wish to know why it has been thought desirable to proceed by Act of Parliamentto implement the Report of the Malta Round Table Conference on the lines indicated in the Prime Minister^ statement of 28th March and at the meeting ofthe Cabinet on 27th March (CM. (56) 25th Conclusions, Minute 7).2. My colleagues will recall that the proposed Bill will be in two parts, thefirst part dealing with Maltese representation at Westminster and the second with further changes in the Maltese Constitution.Representation at Westminster3. The decision to grant Maltese representation can be carried into effect only by an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament. The first part of the Bill will makethe necessary provision for election of Maltese Members of Parliament on thesame basis as Members are elected for constituencies in the United Kingdom.Suspensory Effect4. However, as indicated by the Prime Minister in his statement, theGovernment^ acceptance of Maltese representation at Westminster was contingentupon the Maltese people taking a final decision in a general election that they infact desired such representation. It is therefore proposed that the provisions of theBill relating to representation should not be immediately effective but should bebrought into effect subsequently by Order in Council. This procedure will allowtime for a general election in Malta (which would, of course, only be for seats inthe Maltese Parliament).Amendment of the Maltese Constitution5. The Report of the Round Table Conference also contained recommenda-tions for amending the present Maltese constitution. These related mainly to thepowers of the Maltese Parliament and Government and were contingent uponMaltese representation at Westminster coming into effect. Subject to this requirement, it is proposed that these constitutional changes should be brought intoeffect without delay, i.e., without waiting for the appearance of Malteserepresentatives at Westminster in the next United Kingdom Parliament. A new situation would, however, arise if representation were to be rejected, and it is thusnecessary to make provision in the Bill whereby the proposed new constitution canquickly be amended or revoked if the people of Malta should reject representation at Westminster in the proposed Maltese general election, and a further newconstitution can be granted to fit the new circumstances then obtaining.49867
6. I am therefore advised that the second part of the proposed Bill shouldmake provision (a) to withdraw the present Constitution;(b) to permit the grant of a new Constitution by Order in Council; and(c) to give power to revoke or amend the new Constitution by furtherOrder in Council until such time as the Order in Council bringing thefirst part of the Bill relating to representation comes into effect.Thereafter it will be possible to amend the Constitution only by orunder a further Act of Parliament.The Question of a Two-Thirds Majority7. There has been some criticism by Members of Parliament and in the press of the legislative procedure outlined above. For the most part, however, this criticism has been based on a misapprehension of the present constitutional position. Mistakenly, the view has been expressed that the recommendations ofthe Round Table Conference cannot be implemented constitutionally except by a two-thirds majority of the Maltese Legislature, since the present Constitution of malta provides for its amendment by Act of the Maltese Legislature only if carried by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Legislative Assembly.It is true that many of the provisions of the Malta (Constitution) Letters Patent,1947 and 1954, cannot be amended or repealed at all by further Letters Patentmade by the Crown and can be amended by an Act of the Maltese Legislatureonly if not less than two-thirds of all the members of the Maltese LegislativeAssembly have voted in favour of the measure (although the provisions areamendable by Letters Patent and not by local Act). However, these instrumentsdeal primarily with the Maltese Government and Legislature and with what might perhaps be called the &quot; domestic &quot; constitution of Malta. The powers and functionsof the Maltese Imperial Government and the powers of the Governor to legislateby Ordinance on reserved matters are dealt with in another instrument, namely,the Malta (Office of Governor) Letters Patent, 1947, which can be amended by further Letters Patent made by the Crown and are not subject to amendment byAct of the Maltese Legislature. Moreover, the powers of the United kingdom parliament are in no way affected by the provisions of either of these instruments.8. It is therefore not correct to argue, from the terms of the present constitution, that integration with this country cannot constitutionally occur unless a new general election gives the necessary two-thirds majority, nor is there a validbasis for suggesting that the endorsement of the Maltese people at a general electionwould necessarily require a two-thirds majority vote in the new Maltese LegislativeAssembly.9. It might be argued that, notwithstanding the correct constitutional positionoutlined above, there is a moral case for insisting on a two-thirds majority in thenew Maltese Assembly produced by the proposed general election. To accept this argument would mean that the proposals of the Round Table Conference wouldhave to be rejected for an indefinite period. Dr. Borg 01ivier&apos;s party would obviously never vote with Mr. Mintoffs party in favour of representation at westminster and, under the system of proportional representation in Malta, it is improbable that there would ever be a two-thirds majority in the LegislativeAssembly in favour of any constitutional change.Preparation of Legislation10. Steps are now being taken to prepare legislation as outlined inparagraphs 2-6 above and my Department are arranging for all the interested departments to be consulted. Pending settlement of the question of whichMinister should in future assume responsibility for Maltese affairs I will naturallytake responsibility for co-ordinating the interests of Departments in the legislation,but I shall have to rely particularly on the Home Secretary for advice on those provisions relating to Maltese representation at Westminster.A.
