Printed for the Cabinet.   May1956CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. (56) 127   i23rd May, 1956 \ ; If^SuiCABINETCROWN PRIVILEGEReport of the Committee of ministers the Prime Minister appointed the Committee on Crown Privilege with thefollowing composition and terms of reference:  Composition:Lord Chancellor (Chairman).Home Secretary.Secretary of State for Scotland.Secretary of State for War.Minister of Health.Postmaster-General.Attorney-General.Lord Advocate.Solicitor-General.Financial Secretary, Treasury.Terms of Reference:&quot; To consider the report of a Committee of officials on the question of Crown privilege and to submit their recommendations to theCabinet.&quot;Preliminary2. My colleagues will recall that we were asked to report our conclusionsurgently because the Government will have to state their policy on Crown privilegein connection with an amendment which Mr. J. E. S. Simon, M.P., has tabled tothe Restrictive Trade Practices Bill. The effect of this amendment, which hasbeen deferred until the report stage of the Bill, would be that the question of Crown privilege in respect of documentary or oral evidence in proceedings beforethe Restrictive Practices Court would be determined, unless national security was involved, by the Court and not by the responsible Minister.Principle of Claiming Privilege for Documents on a &quot; Class &quot; Basis3. The Committee of officials recommend that, in the interests of the free and effective working of the Government machine, departmental minutes and reports should continue to be protected as a class by claims for Crown privilege.We endorse this recommendation. Freedom and candour of communication withinthe public service is essential for its proper functioning, and this can, in our view,only be secured by a consistent practice of claiming privilege for minutes and reports. This view has from time to time been challenged by the judiciary, andwe understand that the Bar Council are likely, in the near future, to support a recommendation of the Council&apos;s Law Reform Committee that the courtsthemselves, and not a Minister of the Crown, should have power to decide whethernon-disclosure of documents in a particular case is essential in the public interest.49953
Nevertheless, we invite the Cabinet to agree that the Government should state their intention of adhering; tol^he (line whicfthas hitherto been -taken, the purpose ofwhich is, in general; well understood;Proposals for Modifying the Present policy. - This course can more easily be defended if we are able to announce burintention not to claim privilege for certain factual reports and records which are most in demand in legal proceedings involving the Crown, and which can be disclosed without prejudice to the efficiency of the public service. Relaxation onthese lines of the somewhat rigid practice which has hitherto prevailed would nodoubt be generally welcomed. The Committee of officials identified certain classesof documents, described in the annex, in respect of which they recommend thatclaims for Crown privilege should no longer be made. We invite the Cabinet toagree that documents in these classes should in future be disclosed in the courts.5. In addition to the classes of documents described in the annex, theCommittee of officials recommend that a limited class of official minutes and reports, dealing with road accident cases, except where they concern disciplinarymeasures against Service drivers, should also be disclosed. We think that thiswould be going too far. The apparently anomalous effect would be producedthat minutes were disclosed in one type of accident case and not in another; andthere would,.in our view, be a dangerous and significant inroad into the principlethat departmental minutes should be protected.. We accordingly invite the Cabinetto agree that departmental minutes and reports in road accident cases, in common with all other minutes and reports in the public service, should continue to be protected.Reports of Welfare Officers of the S.S.A.F.A.6. We are unable to submit an agreed recommendation on a proposal bythe Committee of officials that reports of welfare officers employed by the Soldiers&apos;,Sailors&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Families Association (S.S.A.F.A.) should continue to be protected. The principal argument for not disclosing these documents is thatservicemen and their.wives will only seek the help of welfare officers, particularlyin dealing with matrimonial difficulties, if they know that their confidence willbe respected. The Secretary of State for War attaches great importance to thework done by the S.S.A.F.A. in maintaining the morale of the Forces overseas,and would deplore any action which might undermine their work. The argument against claiming privilege for these documents is that it can hardly be maintained that their non-disclosure is essential for the proper working of the public service.We understand, also, that there has never been any question of claiming Crownprivilege for documents relating to the work of welfare officers employed underthe asgis of the Ministry of Health.We invite the Cabinet to decide whether privilege should continue to be claimed for these documents.Arrangements for Stating the Governments Policy7. The proposals set out in the annex for disclosing certain classes of documents which have hitherto been regarded as privileged do not, in our view,constitute a departure of policy of sufficient significance to warrant the publicationof a White Paper, particularly as these limited changes are unlikely to appeasethe critics of the Governments policy on this question. We recommend therefore that the Attorney-General should be authorised to announce these modifications of policy during the debate on the report stage of the Restrictive Trade PracticesBill in connection with Mr. Simotts amendment to clause 18. Such anannouncement will probably restrain opposition to the Governments policybecause it will be understood that a major departure of policy could scarcely be initiated in reference to the Restrictive Practices Court alone.Summary of conclusions.   We invite the Cabinet:  (i) To agree that departmental minutes should continue to be protected asa class by claims for Crown privilege (paragraph 3).(ii) To agree that privilege should no longer be claimed for factual reports and records of the kind described in the annex (paragraph 4).
(iii) To agree that privilege should continue to be claimed: for departmental: minutes and reports in road accident cases (paragraph 5).(iv) To decide whether reports of Welfare Officers employed by the S.S.A.F.A.should continue to be made the subject of claims for privilege(paragraph 6). &apos;-&apos;(v) To agree that the Governments policy in regard to Crown privilege shouldbe announced by the Attorney-General during the debate on the report stage of the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill (paragraph 7).^j^ifM    -.;.;iv,:v. ^ilojjr-j  jfli:!ju ^   ?W] oS ..:,;h^vv; K.    ;18th May, 1956.ANNEXDocuments at present regarded as subject to Crown Privilege which it isproposed in future to disclose(a) Documents relating to road accidents, or accidents on Government premisesThese comprise reports or statements made by employees, statements madeby other persons present at the time of the accident, and subsequent factual reportsmade by the foreman, &amp;c, as to the state of machinery, premises, or vehicleconcerned.(b) Medical records and reportsThese comprise documents kept by doctors employed at Government factories and, in some cases, departmental medical records about the health of government employees. 1(c) Medical reports by Service and Prison doctorsWhere the Crown is sued for negligence, it is intended that privilege should nolonger be claimed for these documents, or for medical documents required by thedefence in criminal proceedings. (Privilege will still be claimed for medical reports by Service and prison doctors in relation to proceedings by private parties.)       -N(d) Various communications made in confidence by members of the publicThese range from income tax returns, and important economic information given in confidence to the Board of Trade, which must clearly continue to be protected, to minor complaints by members of the public. It is,&quot;intended thatdocuments in this class should be examined critically to see whether a claim forprivilege is really necessary. The effective test will be whether the information is really valuable, and whether it was a prerequisite to obtaining it that theDepartment should treat it as strictly confidential.(e) Documents relating to Government contracts and other businessIt is intended that factual documents relating to contracts should generally be disclosed.  (Privilege will continue to be claimed for minutes.and reports in files.)(/) Wider application the principle of not claiming Crown privilege for factual documents may (asindicated by the Committee in paragraph 46 of their report) be applicable in other similar cases, and in particular in tort proceedings or, in Scotland, reparationproceedings other than those relating to accidents.;   , ^i l:.&apos; V
