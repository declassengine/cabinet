(ifl-IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENSECRETC.P.(56) 1061st May, 1956JORDANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall that on 28th February the Cabinet agreecthat H. M. Ambassador in Amman should give certain oral assurances tothe Jordanian Government regarding the intention of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to come to the aid of Jordan in the event of Israel aggression against some other Arab State than Jordan (C. M. (56) 17th Conclusions,Minute 3).     The Prime Minister of Jordan expressed gratification at these assurances and has on&apos;several occasions subsequently asked thatthey be confirmed in writing,2.      In the atmosphere created by the dismissal of General Glubb, Ihave not thought it right to accede to this request.    We have now reached a point, however, when I believe it may be necessary to do so as a partof our policy of keeping Jordan steady in the face of persistent Egyptianefforts to get control of her foreign policy and her armed forces.    Itwill shortly be necessary to hold a meeting of the Anglo-Jordan joint defence Board, at which we shall be called upon to discuss the practical measures we would take to fulfil our Treaty obligations to Jordan in theevent of an Israel aggression.     The departure of General Glubb and theBritish officers has so altered the situation in the Arab Legion that itwould be much more difficult for us to give practical help to Jordan than previously;   consequently the meeting of the Board is likely to be adisappointment to the Jordanians.    It is possible that by giving them the written assurances suggested in the attached draft we should prevent thisdisappointment from leading to a change of policy on their part.3.      The Jordanian Chiefs of Staff and Colonel Nuwar are visiting Cairofor military discussions.    I should not favour giving the assurances until we know what transpires at those discussions.S.L.COPY NO.CABINETForeign Office, S.W.I.30th April, 1956.
WRITTEN ASSURANCES TO THE JORDAN GOVERNMENTIn the event of any power committing aggression against Jordan,Article III of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty will apply.2.     In the event of an act of aggression by Israel against another arab state which brought into operation the Tripartite Declaration of 1950,immediate consultations would take place with the Jordan Government.Meanwhile the plans of Her Majesty&apos;s Government will continue to bebased on the immediate despatch of reinforcements to Jordan.3.      In all these cases Her Majesty&apos;s Government would count on thefull co-operation of the Jordan Government in ensuring that the UnitedKingdom and Jordan military action was properly co-ordinated and directed to the best strategic interests of Jordan.    In order that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment may be able to bring effective help to Jordan, it is essentialthat adequate time should be allowed for consultation on the best jointdeployment of mutual resources.4.      In the event of a confused situation there would be immediateconsultations between the Jordan Government and Her Majesty!s Govern-ment to establish the fact of aggression.    Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave noted that the Jordan Government itself would need to be satisfiedbefore going to the help of any Arab State that it was in fact the victim of aggression.     In these circumstances, mindful of the obligations of both parties to the United Nations, Her Majesty&apos;s Government assume that the jordan Government will agree that the parties should be guided in any action they propose to take by any findings which are made by the united nations.
