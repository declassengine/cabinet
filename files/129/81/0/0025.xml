(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P. (56) 125 COPY NO. 4^16th May, 1956CABINETKARIBA HYDRO-ELECTRIC scheme memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI am not at all happy about the situation in which we shall be placedif we go no further to defend ourselves against subsidised competitionthan is proposed in paragraph 8 of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s paper(C. P. (56) 123).    We shall have lent our money without tying it to thepurchase or installation of British equipment;   and, while the  10 millionslent through the International Bank will be spent in this country, the 10 millions provided by the Colonial Development Corporation and theCommonwealth Development Finance Company will be used locally and in large part on contracts awarded to foreign contractors.    It would be badenough if these results were due to defeat in fair competition.    But itwill be said that the French and Italians had Government subsidies andthat we neglected, in lending our money, to take elementary precautionsto safeguard our exporters from unfair competition.2.      I am not myself persuaded that we need go so far as we do inpractising what we preach about untied loans.    I believe it is the duty ofthe United States Government to put out untied dollars into the world.But this, not because tying money is wrong, but because dollars are scarce.Tied loans are wrong policy for a great creditor country.        But we area debtor country and public opinion here would, I think, see less good cause for us to lend sterling to pay for goods bought from our competitors.3.      But, although our present policies may be open to attack, there arearguments the other way and we can provide a plausible defence, subjectto this condition, that international competition is fair and open.    On this condition, howerer, I feel that we must take a firm stand.    We areentitled, in my view, to ask the International Bank to support us inobjecting to export subsidies, which have been internationally condemnedin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation, and, whatever may already have been said informally to the Bank, we are entitled to refuse our  10 millionsunless we have this support.    Since we can rely on the goodwill of theFederation, I suggest that at the very least the Bank must agree not to object if the Federation, on evidence submitted, decided before awardingcontracts to apply a notional countervailing duty to offset the amount of subsidy that any particular tenders might be judged to contain.    Only ifwe can say that this, at least, has been done, shall we have the basis ofan acceptable answer to criticism from British industry.
4 f\ .o4.      This may or may not make any difference on the facts of thisparticular case.    But unless we are prepared to take this line, this casewill lead to criticism which may seriously prejudice our whole position onlending for development in the Commonwealth and the Colonies.P.T.Board of Trade, S. W. 1.16th May, 1956.\
