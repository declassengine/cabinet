secret.P.(56) 114 COPY NO.   ^ Q5th May, 1956CABINETSELECT COMMITTEE ON THE NATIONALISEDINDUSTRIESMemorandum by the Lord Privy SealMy colleagues will recall that in April, 1953 a Select Committee onthe Nationalised Industries, under the Chairmanship of Lord Clitheroe,produced a report recommending the appointment, by Standing Order, of a select Committee to examine the nationalised industries, with the objectof &quot;Informing Parliament about the aims, activities and problems of the corporations and not of controlling their work&quot;.     The text of theCommittee^ ov*summary of their recommendations is appended to thismemorandum at Annex I.2.      The Government thought it premature to create a Committee underStanding Order.     They were also not convinced of the necessity of appointing to the staff of the Committee &quot;an officer of the status of the comptroller and Auditor General&quot;.    But, for the rest, they accepted thesubstance of the recommendations, and appointed a new Committee under an ad hoc Motion.   Its terms of reference are reproduced at Annex n.    Itwill be noted that they were deliberately so drawn as to preclude theCommittee from investigating &quot;matters which have been decided by theMinister concerned, or clearly engage his responsibility, and for whichhe should, therefore, be answerable on the Floor of the House;   all matters (including questions of wages and conditions of employment) whichare normally decided by collective bargaining arrangements;  matters which fall to be considered through formal machinery established by the relevant Statutes;  and matters of day to day administration&quot;.3.      In November, 1955, the new Committee published a special report,in which they declared that &quot;the only matters on which they would wish to,or could usefully, obtain further information are either matters whichhave been decided by, or clearly engage, or may engage at any time, theresponsibility of a Minister, or are matters falling within one or more of the other limitations in the Order of Reference&quot;.    They thereforeconcluded that they could not usefully pursue their investigations andthey have not met since then.4.     It is clear that matters cannot rest on this basis - the more sosince we are committed, by public statements, to enabling Parliament tomaintain a stricter review of the nationalised industries.    I have there-fore considered, with the Ministers concerned, the basis on which weshould now make a fresh attempt to solve this obstinate problem, bearing that mind that our main objectives must be:-
(a) To satisfy the desire of the ordinary Member ofParliament, particularly on the Government back-benches, for a closer acquaintance with the work-ing of the nationalised industries.(b) To avoid, as far as possible, creating the impression that Parliament is seeking to control those industries or to interfere with the ordinaryresponsibilities of management.(c) To impose the minimum additional burden on ministers.5.      There appear to be three possible solutions:-(i)    To increase the occasions for debates about the nationalised industries on the Floor of the House,and to widen the scope of permitted parliamentary questions.(ii)    To appoint a Standing Committee to consider the affairs of the nationalised industries.(iii)    To appoint a new Select Committee for the same purpose, but with different terms of reference.More frequent debates, etc.6.      This cannot be regarded as an adequate answer to the problem.There is not at the moment - nor is there likely to be for as far ahead aswe can foresee - any spare Parliamentary time which could be devoted todebates on the nationalised industries.    Nor does it seem possiblesignificantly to enlarge the scope of permitted Parliamentary Questionswithout exposing Ministers to the risk of having to answer for mattersof day-to-day administration, for which the Government have alwaysrefused to accept responsibility.7.      The choice lies, therefore, between a Standing Committee and anew Select Committee.    The relevant considerations in each case areanalysed in the report by officials attached at Annex III.    I have examinedthis report, with the Ministers concerned;  and our conclusions are asfollows.Standing committee.      Discussion in a Standing Committee is, in principle,  simply anextension of discussion on the Floor of the House;  and, at first sight, a standing Committee seems to provide that extra margin of time which isnot available on the Floor.    It has the additional advantages that, since a Standing Committee has no power to require persons, papers and records to be made available, Ministers would remain firmly in chargeof the proceedings, and there would be no opportunity for Members to cross-examine representatives of the industries themselves.    Finally,the procedure has been shown to work satisfactorily in the case of theScottish Estimates.9. But the conception of a Standing Committee is open to the followingserious objectionsj-
(a) The analogy with the procedure on Scottish Estimatesis not exact.    The Estimates which the ScottishStanding Committee examine are Estimates for whichthe Secretary of State for Scotland accepts full responsibility.    But in the case of the nationalised industries the Ministers are not directly responsible,and should not appear to assume responsibility, formany of the subjects which a Committee might wishto examine.(b) The Scottish Standing Committee is unique, in the sense that it is the only Standing Committee which considerssubject matter other than Bills.     To extend theprinciple into the field of the nationalised industriesmight be to create a new and undesirable Parliamentaryprecedent, which might lead to the creation of otherStanding Committees to consider particular groups of subjects (e.g. Defence, Finance, colonial affairs, etc.) on the Continental model.(c) The demands on the time of Ministers or their parliamentary Secretaries would be notinconsiderable.(d) A Standing Committee would need to base its discussion on a specific Question or Motion, on which voting would ultimately be possible.    But although the Whip would apply in principle, the maintenance of ordinary Partydiscipline would be more difficult and less reliablethan on the Floor of the House, for the very good reason that most Government supporters are critical of the nationalised industries.(e) It is doubtful whether a mere discussion, under thecontrol of Ministers, would satisfy those members who wish to be able to examine, in addition,representatives of the nationalised industries themselves.    It should be borne in mind, in thisconnection, that the Government made it plain, inconstituting the last Select Committee, that theCommittee should normally take evidence fromrepresentatives of the nationalised industries, andthat Ministers should not normally be invited to appear.Select Committee10.    For the above reasons, we have concluded that there is no realalternative to reviving the conception of a Select Committee, and making afresh attempt to enable such a Committee to do a worthwhile job.    Wehave considered whether, without reverting to the various, prohibitionsincorporated in the terms of reference of the last Select Committee, wecould nevertheless so draft the terms of reference for the new SelectCommittee as to indicate to them the type of question to which they should confine themselves - i. e. the type of question (indicated in the listappended to the report by officials at Annex III) which neither involvesconsiderations of major policy which are the responsibility of Ministers,nor implies an inquisition into minor matters of day-to-day administration
ft &amp;iallwhich must remain the preserve of management.    We have been unable tofind any form of words (e. g. drafts &apos;A&apos; and ,BI in paragraphs 6 and 9 ofthe report by officials) which would be free from ambiguity in thisrespect, and we therefore recommend that the Select Committee should beappointed with the simple terms of reference suggested in draft ,Ct(paragraph 11 of that report), i. e. &quot;To examine the Reports and accounts of the nationalised industries established by Statute, whose controllingbodies are appointed by Ministers of the Crown and whose annual receiptsare not wholly or mainly derived from monies provided by Parliament oradvanced from the Exchequer&quot;.    These terms of reference do not - asdid the terms of reference given to the last Committee - specificallyprohibit the Committee from investigating any particular aspect of theactivities of the nationalised industries.    Given the fact that a SelectCommittee enjoys power to require persons, papers and records to bemade available, limits to the type of question which a member of theCommittee could put (whether to the Chairman of an industry or to the responsible Minister), would be set only by his own ingenuity and by thelatitude    given him by the Chairman.     Moreover, although theCommittee&apos;s attention is formally directed to the Reports and Accounts,i, e, to the past, this may not, of course, prevent them, in fact, fromprojecting the post into the future and so discussing questions of currentpolicy and practice - as, indeed, the terms of reference of the lastCommittee explicitly empowered them.11.     It is important, therefore, that we should mitigate, as far aspossible, the dangers inherent in this situation by:-(a) Selecting a firm and sensible Chairman, who can be relied upon to keep the Committee under control.(b) Providing the Committee with suitable assistance and guidance, preferably in the form of an official(additional to the ordinary Clerk of the House as secretary) whose functions would be to act as the link between the Committee and the Departmentsconcerned, to brief the Chairman and members ofthe Committee, and generally to &quot;steer&quot; theCommittee1s proceedings.    I hope that it may bepossible for the Chancellor of the Exchequer tomake a Treasury officer available for this purpose.(c) Considering whether we should repeat the indicationgiven to the last Select Committee, i. e. that ministers should not normally be required to give evidence.(d) Being prepared to gain the initiative for the Govern-ment by dealing promptly, whether by debate onthe Floor of the House or otherwise, with thereports which the Committee will publish fromtime to time.12.    We must clearly recognise, however, that no device can guaranteesuccess in this delicate operation of confining the Select Committee to a range of subject matter and a method of working which will not embarrass the Government.    That result will depend largely on the goodwill and common-sense of the Committee themselves.    Given a reasonable
approach on their part, the Committee should, work tolerably well.    With-out a reasonable approach, nothing can safeguard the Government fromperiodical irritation and embarrassment.13,    The question is whether we announce our intentions before theSecond Reading Debate on the Coal Industry Bill next Thursday, orwhether we make a statement, by an arranged Question and answer, inthe following week.    I shall value my colleagues&apos; advice, after giving them the result of my latest soundings of opinion in the House.R.A.B.Office of the Lord Privy Seal,S.W.1.4th May, 1956.
SUMMARY OF recommendations the substance of our recommendations is therefore asfollows :-(a) There should be appointed a Committee of the House of commons by Standing Order, to examine the Nationalised Industries, with powerto send for persons, papers and records, power to set up sub-committeeand to report from time to time;(b) The Committee should direct their attention to the publishedReports and Accounts, and to obtaining further information as to thegeneral policy and practice of the Nationalised Industries establishedby Statute, whose controlling Boards are wholly nominated by ministers of the Crown, and whose annual receipts are not wholly derived frommoneys provided by Parliament or advanced from the Exchequer;(c) The object of the Committee should be that of informingParliament about the aims, activities and problems of the corporations and not of controlling their work.(d) The staff of the Committee should include an officer of thestatus of the Comptroller and Auditor General who should be an officerof the House of Commons, with high administrative experience;   atleast one professional accountant, and such other staff as required;(e) The statutory auditors of the corporations shall, in preparingtheir annual reports, give such information in addition to that nowprovided by them as may be of use to the Committee and of interest toParliament.
ANNEX IITERMS OF REFERENCEORDERED, That a Select Committee be appointed to examinethe Reports and Accounts of the Nationalised Industries established by-Statute whose controlling Boards are wholly appointed by Ministers ofthe Crown and whose annual receipts are not wholly or mainly derivedfrom moneys provided by Parliament or advanced from the Exchequer,and to obtain further information as to so much of the current policyand practices of those industries as are not matters which -(a) have been decided by or clearly engage theresponsibility of Ministers;(b) concern wages and conditions of employment and other questions normally decided bycollective bargaining arrangements;(c) fall to be considered through formal machineryestablished by the relevant statutes, or(d) are matters of day-to-day administration:-And the Committee was nominated of Mr. Albu, Mr. Blyton,Mr. Ernest Davies, Viscount Hinchingbrooke, Sir Ian Horobin.Mr, Hutchison, Colonel Lancaster, Mr. Palmer, Mr. Renton,Sir Patrick Spens, Mr. Strauss, Mr. Wade and Miss Ward,ORDERED, That Five be the Quorum of the Committee.ORDERED, That the Committee have power to send for persons, papers and records.ORDERED, That the Committee have power to reportfrom time to time.
ANNEX    hiREPORT BY sfftcIALSIn the light of the discussion at the meeting of the ministerial Sub-Committee of the 12th March, we have attempted to draft revised terms of reference for the Select Committeeon nationalised industries and to prepare a list of suitablesubjects for consideration by such a Committee.     We have alsoexamined a subsequent suggestion that the examination of the nationalised industries should be entrusted to a StandingCommittee.Se1ect committee.      It may be convenient to approach the problem via the listof subjects which,  in the opinion of Departments, could use-fully be examined by a Select Committee without any great risk that the Government would become involved in the embarrassmentswhich have hitherto been envisaged.      These lists, which areillustrative and not necessarily exhaustive, are appended tothis memorandum.      The questions which they embody are clearlyquestions of substance;    and a Select Committee could clearlydo useful work in investigating them.     The problem is whethera Select Committee could be confined, on the hypothesis of normal organisation and acceptable terms of reference, to matters of this kind, and could be prevented from trespassingin the directions from which Ministers, at their last meeting,indicated that they wished to debar them.      In particular,would a Select Committee consider these and similar questionswithout summoning Ministers to give evidence, withoutdiscussing major issues of Government policy, and withoutburrowing into &quot;minor&quot; matters of day to day administration?3.      It is inherent in the constitution of any Select Committeethat it should be specifically empowered to require persons,papers and records to be made available to it.     A SelectCommittee on the nationalised industries could not, presumably,be an exception to this universal principle.     In which case:-(a)    The Committee could compel the attendance of the chairman and Members of the Boards of the Industry, together, of course,with their staffs.      It is unlikely that the Committee wouldrefrain from using this power.     And there would, therefore,be a clear risk that the industries would be subject to thattype of inquisitorial pressure, possibly extending into very&quot;minor&quot; matters of day to day administration, which ministers have always feared would seriously detract from their feeling of independence and the commercial spirit in which theydischarge their respective functions.      There appears to beno simple means of drafting the terms of reference in such away as to exclude &quot;minor&quot; matters of this kind, withoutprovoking endless and fruitless discussion of what constitutes a &quot;minor&quot;, as distinct from a &quot;major&quot;, question ofadministration.     And this means that the Committee would have considerable scope for interference in the proper preservesof management.
(b)    The Committee would also he empowered to require the attendance of Ministers (and, of course, their advisers).Other Select Committees - notably the Public Accounts Committee -are similarly empowered, but, by long custom, do not exercise their authority in this respect.    It would, however, be unwise to assume that a new Committee, with no tradition behind itand an intriguing field of subject matter before it, would exercise a similar restraint.    If it did choose to summonMinisters to give evidence, two consequences would probablyfollow:-(i)   Although the Committee could be expected to receive any evidence which Ministers wished to give,  the ability of Ministers to influence the Committee&apos;sproceedings would depend as much on the Committee&apos;swillingness to hear them as on their own willingness to appear.    In short, the extent to which ministers could control the scope and direction of theCommittee&apos;s deliberations would be definitely limited.(ii)    Since the Committee, although a&apos;pu.public&apos; body, would presumably follow normal practice and sit in private.Ministers would also face the risk (particularly on questions of major policy) that they would discover(possibly only after the event) that the evidence which they and their advisers had given did notsquare with the evidence given by the chairmen and the other spokesmen of the nationalised industries.There are obvious possibilities of embarrasment in this type of situation.ho      As indicated above, these difficulties are inherent in thevery nature and constitution of any Select Committee, asnormally understood;  and to seek to resolve them by curtailingthe ordinary powers of a Select Committee (particularly inrespect of -oersors, papers and records) would be so unpreceden-ted a step that it is presumably ruled out from furtherconsideration.    It remains,  therefore,  to consider how fardifficulties which cannot be v/holly eliminated might be to someextent reduced, by providing the Committee with appropriateassistance and by giving them suitable terms of reference.Assistance for the Committee5.     Whatever the means adopted, the objective would presumablybe to ensure that the Committee were supplied with an adequateflow of relevant material, that they so interpreted their terms of reference as to cause the minimum of embarrassment tothe Government, and that, while doing a solid and worthwhilejob of work, they interfered as little as possible with themanagerial responsibilities of the industries concerned.    Thereseem to be two possibilities:-(a)    The Committee should be given, in addition to the normalClerk of the House as Secretary, an impartial official whose main function would be to act as the link between the Committeeand the Departments concerned, to brief the Chairman and Membersof the Committee, and to help the Committee to spend their timeusefully.    It might be preferable that such an official shouldnot be drawn from the Departments concerned, since he mightwell be suspected by the Committee of being little more than the
spokesman and protector of the nationalised industries concerned.    As far as possible;, therefore, he should enjoyan independent status; and even although he would probably have to be drawn from a Government Department, he shouldbe definitely seconded for a period of several years to actprimarily as the servant of the Committee.There would be certain advantages in an arrangement ofthis kind.    The official concerned would be familiar withthe working of the Whitehall machine in general; he -wouldknow where to turn for advice, and how to use it with discretion and responsibility;  and he should be capable ofacting with more authority and decision in this field than an ordinary Clerk of the House.    On the other hand, he would assess no particular knowledge and experience of theindustries concerned, and of their relations with theirparent Departments; he might, on occasion, experience an embarrassing conflict of loyalties as between the Committeeand the Government;  and he would be liable to be underconsiderable temptation - and perhaps pressure from theCommittee itself-to develop into a professional inquisitor,amd to try to build up a Department round him, on the modelof the Comptroller and Auditor General.    Given the latter&apos;sstatutory authority and unique responsibilities, anyanalogy of this kind would, of course, be false; but thatwould not necessarily prevent its being prayed in aid of theSelect Committee&apos;s developing some similar instrument oftheir own - a concejjtion which was recommended by thooriginal Assheton Committee but rejected by the Government,,The considerations which prompted that rejection arepresumably no less valid today.(b)   Alternatively, the Departments primarily concerned couldthemselves provide the Committee with advice and briefing,by a system of liaison officers such as was tried, withoutmarked success, in the case of the last Select Committee.These liaison officers might be viewed by the Committee witha certain amount of suspicion, on the ground that their main purpose would be believed to lie in protecting their departments and industries rather than in assisting theCommittee to obtain further information about these bodies.But this should not be an insuperable objection, if theliaison officers were of sufficient standing and were ableto convince the Committee that they were present to help and not to hinder.    It has been suggested that thePermanent Secretaries of the Departments involved mightthemselves be the liaison officers for this purpose;  and that,although they would presumably delegate this duty to junior officers from time to time,  they would keep in closepersonal touch with the Committee, and would be constantlyavailable to give them help and guidance in selecting -useful subject matter for investigation.    The fact thatthis advice would be given with the maximum of authority must be offset against the demands on the time of thePermanent Secretaries concerned.
Terms of Reference6.      Given that any Select Committee would presumably beempowered to require persons, papers and records to be madeavailable to it, it is in the drafting of the terms ofreference that the main difficulty arises.      We have initiallyapproached    the problem by attempting to draft terms ofreference which would at least appear to be more imaginative,and to offer greater scope for independent action, than thosewhich the last Select Committee condemned as unworkable.      Onthis hypothesis we put forward the following draft forconsideration:-Draft   &apos;Ar&quot;To examine, with special reference, to.....the Reports and accounts of the nationalised industries&apos; established,by Statute, whose controlling Boards are whollyappointed by Ministers of the Crown and jwhose, annualreceipts are not wholly or mainly derived from moniesprovided by Parliament or advanced from the Exchequer,the efficiency and economy with which those industriesconduct their operations in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions and with such directionsand indications of &quot;policy as they receive from timeto time from the Ministers concerned&quot;.7.      The terms of this draft give the Committee severalpointers to the lines on which they should work;    but theydo not secure that the Committee would not be able totrespass beyond the boundaries.      Thus:-(a) In directing the attention of the Committee primarily to the Reports and Accounts of the nationalised industries,they turn the Committeefs eyes to the past rather than tothe present or to the future.        But they do not confine their activities solely to the Reports and Accounts;  and theextent to which the Committee chose to consider currentactivities and future policies would depend on the spirit inwhich they approached their remit.      (Note that the terms ofreference of the earlier Select Committee embraced &quot;currentpolicy and practices&quot;.)(b) They require the Select Committee &quot;to examine theefficiency and economy with which those industries conduct their operations......&quot;.      The terms of reference of theearlier Select Committee empowered that body merely &quot;toobtain further information as to so much of the currentpolicy and practices.....The suggested new terms ofreference would,  therefore, appear to give the Committee moreteeth, in that they would enable them &quot;to examine&quot; theindustries concerned.      But their examination would bedirected to &quot;efficiency and economy&quot;, and those words couldbe read to imply that the Committee&apos;s main concern shouldbe with the executive capacity of the nationalised industries.i,e. with their ability to discharge the various functionsderiving from policy decisions which are assumed to be outsidethe terms of reference.      But again - and subject to (c) belowthe exclusion of policy is implicit, not explicit;    and if theSelect Committee chose to maintain, as would certainly not be unreasonable, that the efficiency and economy with which aparticular industry was conducting its operations was
dependent on, and was materially affected by, major decisionsof policy, the words &quot;efficiency and economy&quot; would not of themselves suffice to preclude them from examining those decisions of policy.(c)    The words in accordance with the relevantstatutory provisions and with such directions and indications of policy as they receive from time to time from theMinisters concerned&quot; might suffice to debar the SelectCommittee from considering:-(i)    Issues of policy (provided that these were known,at the time of examination, to be matters onwhich a Minister had given the industry concerned either a formal direction or at least some indication of the Government&apos;s requirements);(ii)    The type of question which falls, in the wording of the terms of reference of the last SelectCommittee, &quot;to be considered through formalmachinery established by the relevant Statutes&quot;.(Note,  in this connection, that the terms ofreference of the last Select Committee excludedin addition, and specifically,  &quot;matters which concern wages and conditions of employment andother questions normally decided by collective bargaining&apos; arrangements&quot;.      It is uncertain whether the terms of reference proposed inparagraph 6, even if interpreted as circum-spectly as is suggested above, would precludediscussion of wages,  conditions of employment,etc.      But to add a specific provision to this effect,  on the lines of that embodied in theterms of reference of the last Select Committee,might give too negative and restrictive an impression;    and it might be wiser to leave itto the good sense of the Committee to observereasonable discretion in this field, )But the effectiveness of these words in keeping- theCommittee on the rails would  clearly depend on their beingpretty strictly interpreted;    and they could not be relied upon to prevent a really determined Committee from trespassingon questions of major policy.      The Committee might, forexample,  choose to start work by asking for an exhaustivelist of all the questions on which directions or indications of policy had been or were about to be, given by the relevantMinisters;    and, when they had studied this list, they wouldbe liable to complain (as did their predecessors) that itleft them no worth-while material to consider,  or to startexamining the individual policy decisions embodied in the list to make sure that they really were rulings of policyand could not by some means be brought within the terms ofreference.8.      The terms of reference in paragraph 6 are not, therefore,watertight, in the sense that they do not, and cannot,guarantee to Ministers all the safeguards which they desire.Moreover,  they are open to other, and rather differentobjections.      Thus, it can be argued that:-(a)    Even though they are rather less negative in tonethan the terms of reference which the last Select Committeecondemned as unworkable, they do not really correspond to
what the original Assheton Committee envisaged as the object ofthe Select Committee, i.e. the object &quot;of informing Parliamentabout the aims, activities and problems of the corporations and not of controlling their work&apos;&quot;.      For this reason eventhese terms of reference might fail to commend themselves toany elements of Parliamentary opinion which may wish to get tthe root of the major problems (including policy problems) ofthe nationalised industries.(b) Even if policy problems oould be firmly ruled out, and theCommittee could be limited to examining the executive capacityof the nationalised industries, the &quot;economy and efficiency&quot; ofthose industries would remain a vast field of subject matter,far wider and more complex than a Committee could hope to investigate thoroughly.     And the more thorough their attempt,the more liable they would be to become bogged down in the typeof detailed question of day to day administration from which ministers are anxious to exclude them.(c) Given that the future of the nationalised industries mustlie in the adoption of the best practice of large scalecommercial concerns rather than in the more rigid procedures which public accountability imposes on Government Departments,it is very desirable that men of high attainments and highpotential should be attracted to the senior management.      Butthey would be unlikely to be so attracted if they were treatedas personally accountable to a Select Committee,  expresslycharged with the examination of the efficiency and economy oftheir organisations.     And there is, therefore, a risk that theterms of reference in paragraph 6, if vigorously implemented,would progressively undermine efficient and independent manage-ment in the nationalised Corporations.9*     For these reasons, we have considered alternative termsof reference as follows:Draft  ,Bt&quot;To examine the Eeports and Accounts of the nationalised industries established by Statute, whose controllingBoards&quot;are wholly appointed by Ministers of the &quot;Crown and whose annual receipts arc not wholly,, or mainly, derivedfrom monies provided by Parliament or advanced from theExchequer,  and to obtain further information about the way in which those industries *o*6&quot;nduct&quot;&quot;&quot;their &quot;operations inaccordance with the relevant statutory, provisions .an^withsuch directions and indications of policy as they receive from time to time from the Ministers concerned.&quot;10.    This alternative draft would still preserve, in its closingwords, the broad hint to the Committee that the relevantstatutory provisions, together with Ministerial directions andindications of policy, were outside the scope of their enquiry;but it would confine the Committee&apos;s powers of actual examina-tion t.o the Reports and Accounts of the nationalised industries,and thereafter would simply empower the Committee to obtain information about the way in which the industries work.      Ifstrictly interpreted, it would significantly weaken the powersof the Committee to condemn or to absolve a nationalised industry in respect of particular practices, i.e. its powersto pass judgment on the industry as a whole.     And it is open to question whether, from this point of view, the revised draftwould be acceptable to Parliamentary opinion.      On the otherhand, in terms of tho objectives which Ministers have in mind,
it may be thought to be rather more satisfactory than the draft in paragraph 6;    and it might be defended against parliamentary criticism on the grounds that the function of the SelectCommittee should be not to condemn or to absolve, but rather -in accordance with the original recommendation of the AsshetonCommittee - to elicit more information about the activities ofthe nationalised industries than is possible in the course of relatively infrequent debates on the floor of the House.11.    Alternatively, if the draft in paragraph 6 is rejected,it might be simpler, and perhaps, in the long term, no more dangerous, to give the Committee a simple instruct ionDraft &apos;Cf&apos;&apos;To examine the Reports and Accounts of the Nationalised,Industries established by Statute., whose controllingBoards are appointed by Ministers of the Crown and whoseannual receipts are not wholly,  or mainly, derived frommonies provided by Parliament or advanced from theExchequer&quot;!to add no embellishment or safeguard to these straightforwardterms of reference;    and to rely on the good sense of theCommittee to ensure that no substantial damage resulted.Against this view, it can be argued that, on the hypothesis ofunqualified terms of reference combined with the power to requirepersons, papers and records to be made available to theCommittee, the gamble would be even greater from the Government1spoint of view than in the case of either of the more elaborateterms of reference quoted in paragraphs 6 and 9 above.12.    It must be emphasised, however,  that, whatever terms ofreference were finally adopted, success in the delicate opera-tion of confining the Select Committee to a range of subject matter and a method of working which would not be embarrassing to the Government could not be achieved by any subtlety ofwording.      It would depend almost entirely on the goodwill and common sense of the Committee themselves.     Given a reasonableapproach on their part, almost any terms of reference should work tolerably well.     Without a reasonable approach, noprecision and ingenuity of drafting would safeguard theGovernment from continual irritation and periodical embarrass-ment.     A very great deal, therefore, would depend on the member-ship of the Committee (particularly on the personality of itsChairman) and on the guidance which it received from the officialadviser (discussed in paragraph 5 above), if he were appointed.
rayReport of the Committee13.    Finally, it must he &quot;borne in mind that, following normal practice, the Committee would presumably produce, and publish,considered Reports at periodical intervals.      The Governmentwould have relatively little opportunity to influence the content of these Reports.     But once they were published(together with the minutes of evidence given to the Committee),they would tend to be regarded as the authoritative expression of Parliament&apos;s opinions about the nationalised industriesuntil the Government found a convenient opportunity of replying,whether by publishing counter-comments of their own, or - perhapspreferably - by finding time for a debate on the floor of theHouse.      In this interval, considerable public discussion mightbe provoked:    the nationalised industries themselves might notbe prepared to maintain silence in the face of what they might regard as unjustified criticism;    and the Government might find that, when it proved possible to arrange a debate on the Reports,their own position had been further embarrassed.Standing Committee1h.    In view of the difficulties involved in the conception ofa Select Committee, we have considered whether a preferablesolution might be found in the suggestion that the scrutiny ofthe nationalised industries should be entrusted to a StandingCommittee.     We understand the reference to be to a StandingCommittee in the normal sense of the term,  i.e. the type ofCommittee to which Bills are referred, for examination.15.    It is true that the legitimate business of standing committees is not confined to the examination of Bills - seeStanding Order 57 &quot;As many Standing Committees shall be appointed as may be necessary for the consideration of Bills or other business committed or referred to a Standing Covriittee&quot;.    Butthere are only two precedents for &quot;other business&quot; beingreferred to a Standing Committee:-(a) In 1919 Departmental Estimates (excluding Votes A and I ofthe Navy, Army and Air Force) were referred to standing committees instead of to the Committee of Supply.      TheEstimates were to   be considered by such Committees in accordancewith the customary procedure of the Committee of Supply;Resolutions agreed to by these Committees were reported to theHouse from time to time;    and these Resolutions, when soreported, were proceeded with by the House as if they had beenreported by the Committee of Supply.     This procedure, founded on a Sessional Order in 1919, was not repeated after that Session,except in a modified form in the case of -(b) Scottish Estimates.      In 19^8, the Scottish StandingCommittee was empowered, by Standing Order 61, to consider theScottish Estimates on not more than six days in any Session.But the Scottish Standing Committee was given no power to assume the functions of the Committee of Supply, as in 1&apos;9&apos;i9;    it was authorised solely to &quot;consider&quot; the Estimates,  so that theyagain stood referred to the Committee of Supply when reported from the Standing Committee.     This arrangement is still inoperation.

If, by attempted analogy, a Standing Committee of this type were constituted to deal with the nationalised industries,its terms of reference would presumably he a simple direction to &quot;consider&quot; the Reports and Accounts of those industries;and. the Committee would, we imagine, arrange a series ofDebates on those Reports and Accounts on a specified numberof days during the year*    (Mr, Nabarro, M.P.. who is known to favour this idea, had indicated that he envisages twenty-fourmeetings of the Committee&apos;each year, of which nine might be devoted to Fuel and Power, six to Transport, two to Scotland,and the balance to any other subjects which might be relevant^    Twenty-four meetings may be thought excessive.But although a more&quot;modest figure might be substituted   atleast at the outset, it Is clear that a Standing Committee ofthis kind would need to meet relatively often if it was toget through its works)      In accordance with normal practice,Ministers would be required to attend;    but since a StandingCommittee (unlike a Select Committee) has no . powers torequire persons, papers and records to be made available toit, it could not summon representatives of the nationalised industries themselves,17*   A Standing Committee of this kind, would have certain advantages*    Thus -(a) Subject&apos;to the Chairman&apos;s interpretation of the termsof reference, the Debates could presumably range prettywidely;    and Members would have&apos;time and opportunity todevelop their views, criticisms, and enquiries at relativeleisure0    The nationalised industries would be given a regular and thorough airing;    and since the membership ofa Standing Committee could be anything up to fifty, aconsiderable body of informed opinion about the industries would gradually be built up in Parliament,(b) The fact that Ministers would be present as full membersof the Committee, and that&apos;the normal Party Whip would   ifnecessary, be in operation, would&apos;enable the Government to&apos;keep control&apos; over, the proceedings, and to disclose as much,or as little, as they chose on questions of major policy^(c) Since the nationalised Industries themselves could notbe required to attend, they would not be subject to the kindof inquisitorial pressure which might react adversely ontheir commercial independence and efficiency;    nor should there be any risk of embarrassment arising from the expression of conflicting views on issues of policy ry Ministers andthe spokesmen of the industries.(d) Indeed, Ministers might find, on occasion, that the criticisms expressed in the Committee were of positiveassistance to them in bringing pressure to bear on theindustries concerned,18*    On the other hand, a&apos; Standing Committee would be open tothe following objections -(a)    It would make heavy demands on the time of Ministers andof the officials who would have to brief them, even thoughthe briefing would to some extent be done concurrently withthe discussion in Committee, and not entirely in advance,,
(b) It would, involve Ministers in appearing as the spokesmenand defenders of the Nationalised Industries in a more sustainedand detailed degree than is required by an occasional debate on the floor of the House.    It is in this respect that the analogy with the procedure of the Scottish Standing&apos;Committeeis Imperfect,,    The Scottish Standing Committee is concerned todiscuss, in the words of Standing Order 61 , &quot;the estimates for which the Secretary of State for Scotland is responsible&quot;;and it is in virtue of that responsibility that the Secretaryof State is a member of the Committee,,    But In the case of the nationalised industries, the responsibility of the relevantMinisters is neither so direct nor so extensive;    and ministers may foresee possible embarrassment in beingcompelled to expound, as it were, the case &quot;for&quot; a nationalised industry in the detail which a Standing Committeewould entail*(c) The proceedings of a Standing Committee&apos;are normallypublic.    They are also subject, in principle    to the discipline of the Party Vifhip*   Ministers may feel that the result mightbe an undesirably partisan discussion of issues which demand,as objective and impartial an approach, as possible.(d) As indicated above, the&apos;example of the Scottish StandingCommittee is an isolated one, and is justified by particularpolitical considerations which have now been recognised and accepted, in this context, for nearly thirty years.   Theestablishment of a Standing Committee to consider theactivities of the nationalised industries would,  therefore,be an innovation and a departure from all normal practice;and it would be a precedent which could be dangerous, in sofar as It might create pressure for the appointment of similar Committees on other matters which engage theresponsibility of Ministers.    The conception Is, in fact,more appropriate to Local Authority administration than tothe accepted practice at Westminster;    and there is a risk that, if it were Introduced in Parliament,, it might reviveearlier proposals for the constitution of a system of&quot;subject matter&quot; Committees on the Continental model.    (against this view, however, it can be argued that the nationalised industries are themselves unique, and that the methods which parliament adopts in order to inform itself more closelyabout their activities arc not necessarily a valid precedent in other cases, where different considerations apply. Itis open to question how far this argument could be relied upon in practice,)(e) Although Mr. Nabarro, M.P.. has indicated that he,personally, would be c ontent with the appointment    of a normal Standing Committee, with simple terms of referenceconfined to the Reports and Accounts of the nationalised industries, it is not certain that this conception would be equally acceptable to those other Members of Parliament whoare pressing for a more lively degree of Parliamentary contact with&apos;the industries in question.    This difficulty would probably-first become apparent in the drafting of the Motion whichwould be necessary to apply the principle of Standing Order 57to the nationalised industries.    That Motion, if it followed the Scottish precedent of Standing Order 61, would revealthat the functions of the Standing Committee would be very-1 0-
limited - Standing Order 61  concludes &quot;...  the StandingCommittee&apos;shall consider the&apos;Estimates referred to them,and shall, from time &apos;to &quot;time, report only that they have considered the said Estimates, or any of them, which shallagain stand referred to the Committee of Supply after suchreport has been brought up&quot;.     It is open to question whethera Standing Committee on the nationalised industries would be content with terms of reference on this model, or whetherthey would not rather insist on being empowered to make a substantive report to Parliament, setting out in some detail(as do, for example, the reports of the P.A.C) their commentsand criticisms on the industries in question.    Moreover, the motion constituting the Standing Committee would have to be debated;    and it would become clear, during that Debate,that the Standing Committee would not be empowered to requirepersons, papers and records to be made available to it.Here again it is open to question whether this would be acceptable to Parliament;    or whether some Members might nottry to insist on the CommitteeTs being empowered to requirethe attendance, not merely of Ministers, but also of theChairman and the other spokesmen of the nationalised industries.19*    But if it became necessary to yield to pressure of thiskind, the result would not be a Standing Committee in thenormal sense of that term;    it&apos;would be something much nearer to a Standing Select Committee, i,e.  to that type of SelectCommittee (e.g. the P.A.CB and the Estimates Committee)which is not appointed on an ad hoc basis, or expected tocomplete a defined task within a limited period, but isreappointed as a matter of course at the beginning of eachSession, and is a part of the recognised and establishedmachinery of Parliament.    But&apos;a Standing Select Committeeof this kind would, of course, be open to all the objections which, as indicated in the first half of this paper, are inherent in any Select Committee.Summary20* In this memorandum we have tried to examine thealternative approaches t o this problem provided by -(a) A Select Committee(b) A Standing Committee21.   Fundamentally, the difference between these two types of Committee is the difference between a procedure which is liable t o become an inquisition, and a procedure which neednot become more than a discussion*     The choice between them is, therefore, essentially a political choice, which mustaim to combine regard for the rights of Parliament with adequate safeguards for the nationalised industries ascommercial undertakings and for the Ministers responsiblefor them.    In reaching their decision, Ministers will wishto bear in mind that -(a)    In terms of a Select Committee (which would be empoweredto require persons, papers and records to be made availableto it)&quot;, the risk of the Committee&apos;s conducting a detailed and direct inquisition of the nationalised industries them-selves might be reduced - but could never be eliminated -if it were given adequate assistance and suitable termsof reference.    The terms of reference could themselves be either simple or more elaborate;    and arguments can be
advanced in favour of either.    But it must be emphasised that no ingenuity of drafting can safeguard.Ministers andthe industries from the risks involved, and that asatisfactory solution to the problem must always depend onthe goodwill and common sense of the Committee itself.If goodwill and common sense were not forthcoming, theresult would be bound to be trouble - perhaps very serious trouble,(b)    In terms of a Standing Committee (which would not beempowered to require persons, papers and records to be madeavailable to It) it would be Ministers themselves, and notthe nationalised industries, who would be involved indetailed discussion.    The Government might, therefore, beestablishing a doubtful precedent for the Parliamentarytreatment of individual groups of subject matter.    moreover the Ministers concerned would be assuming a notinconsiderable additional burden of work, and would be liable to become more &quot;answerable&quot; for the affairs of the nationalised industries than is necessary in an occasionaldebate on the floor of the House.    For precisely thisreason, it cannot be assumed that a Standing Committeewould be acceptable to any Members of Parliament who may wish to be able to examine the nationalised industriesdirectly.    It is a matter for political judgment whether these risks are worth taking In order to protect theindustries themselves from the type of investigation which their parent Departments fear would be detrimental totheir independence and efficiency as commercial enterprises
