THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT)confidential.P.(56) 105 COPY NO.26th April, 1956CABINETVOLTA RIVER PROJECTNote by the President of the Board of TradeI circulate a report by Sir Frank Lee, the Permanent Secretaryof the Board of Trade, on behalf of the United Kingdom delegation atthe recent talks on the Volta River Project.2.      The report recommends that as the next step Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should invite the International Bank to study the project.This would involve a delay of up to eighteen months during which thescheme will need to be reassessed in the light of the serious difficulties which emerged in the recent discussions.    Always providedthat it does not lead to political difficulties with the Gold Coast, sucha delay in present circumstances will be no bad thing:  and I thinkthat an examination of the project by the International Bank will be advantageous to all parties.     I therefore recommend that we should agree to co-operate with the Gold Coast Government in making an approach to the Bank on the lines proposed.P.T.Board of Trade, S.W.1.25th April, 1956.
ISReport by Sir Frank Lee, Chairman of Official discussions on Volta River Pi-ojectOn 8th March the Cabinet considered memoranda, C.P.(56) 60and 71, on the Volta River scheme and gave instructions to guide the United Kingdom Delegation at the forthcoming talks withrepresentatives from the Gold Coast Government and the aluminiumcompanies (C.M0(56) ZOth Conclusions, Minute 5).    As a result theGold Coast Government were informed that because of the substantial increases in the cost of the scheme and the United Kingdom&apos;s reducedability to contribute to it, the scheme could only go forward with united Kingdom participation if there was an assurance of substantialfinancial support from outside the sterling area, in particular fromthe International Bank.2.      The talks took place from 4th until 10th April.   A memorandumsummarising the main points discussed is annexed;  this has beenprepared in a form suitable for communication to, and agreement with,the other parties.3.      As the talks progressed it became apparent that there were very substantial difficulties in the way of proceeding on the basiscontemplated in the 1952 White Paper.4.      Aluminium Limited made it clear that in certain very important respects their attitude to the scheme had been radicallymodified,     Thus:-(a) They were no longer prepared (as in the 1952 scheme)for the smelter company to buy power on a cost-plusbasis.(b) Instead they considered that the smelter company should buy power under a long-term contract at aprice fixed before the power plant was constructed.(c) They thought that a price tolerable to them in conditions of today would only enable the powerplan to operate profitably if the interest on thecapital investment did not exceed 3jj per cent.(d) For the first few years of the project they would not use local bauxite but rely on imported alumina.(e) Their responsibility for contributing to the cost ofthe smelter at the first stage (120, 000 tons) wouldbe limited to about  24 millions, all in equity capital.5.      On behalf of the United Kingdom it was made clear that:-(a) Our contribution would be for a finite sum at a fixed rate of interest:  we could not share in the equity risks.(b) The Government could not contemplate advancingmoney at less than the full cost to itself of borrowingfor a comparable period;  in present circumstancesthis would be between 5 per cent and 5^ per cent.-1-
(c) Y) e could not provide capital for the scheme to theextent contemplated in 1952.(d) Steps should be taken to seek substantial assistanceto the scheme from sources outside the sterling area, notably the International Bank.6.      These changes taken together confronted the Gold Coastdelegation with a position of great difficulty.     They were not in any event empowered to negotiate a final acceptance on any point.    Theyindicated that, subject to certain conditions, the Gold Coast Governmentwould probably be prepared to accept the proposal to -concentrate on imported alumina in the early stages of the smelter.    But they urgedthat the combined effect of the proposals of Aluminium Limited and ofthe limited contributions which might be expected from the United Kingdomand the International Bank would mean that the Gold Coast Governmentwould have to face a far greater burden than they had ever contemplatedbecause of the sharply increased costs of the scheme and the heavy-residual risk of increased costs over the power project during a very long period of construction.     (In private conversation the leader ofthe delegation - the Economic Adviser to the Government - said that even on an optimistic assumption about what the International Bankmight contribute the total falling on the Gold Coast would, in his view,certainly be beyond its resources).7.      During the actual discussions there was little pressure on us from the Gold Coast delegation to modify our attitude about the decreasedinvestment to be expected from the United Kingdom, and we managed to avoid stating the sum which we should be prepared to contribute.We were, however, asked whether we could not agree that a SToecial and reduced rate of interest could be granted in respect of this scheme.We explained that this would not be possible.8.      These difficulties brought the talks to an impasse.    But therewas no disposition to end on a note of complete breakdown.    The UnitedKingdom and Gold Coast delegations therefore agreed to recommend totheir respective Governments that the International Bank should beinvited to consider at an early date the whole project in the light of thereport of the Preparatory Commission and of the April discussions.The aluminium companies were in full agreement with this proposal.9.      It is clear that Aluminium Limited remain much interested inthe scheme, but are sincerely concerned at its increased cost anddecreased profitability and at the uncertainties attendant upon a project of this magnitude in an under-developed country.    And they are troubledabout the risks of a political and administrative deterioration in theGold Coast following independence.     They have therefore made it plainto us (in private discussions) that their objective is to keep the schemealive, presumably with a view to keeping others from taking their placein it, but not to commit themselves to embarking upon it (even to the limited extent of their present proposals) until they have, seen how theGold Coast conducts its affairs as an independent country.10.    There is no doubt that the Gold Coast delegation were extremelydisappointed at the course which the discussions took.    Insofar as theirdisappointment was reflected in resentment, the representatives of aluminium Limited had to bear the brunt of their criticisms.    This doesnot mean, however, that Gold Coast Ministers may not be critical, eventhough to a lesser extent, of some aspects of the United Kingdom&apos;s attitude,
i and of our line about the rate of interest at which we would lend.There may also be some criticism of our lack of readiness to bearany of the residual risks.    It is unlikely that our statement that therewas little justification for the aluminium Companies to take the equity profits of the scheme as a whole without carrying any shareof the risk in the power project will fully counteract any hard feelingsabout our attitude on these points.    Nevertheless the Gold coast government are making arrangements for the Minister of Finance topay a very early visit to Washington to contact the International Bank.There is therefore good reason to hope that they will not at presentseek for economic assistance from the Soviet bloc, and accordinglythat the political dangers foreseen in paragraph 8 of C,P.(56) 60 havebeen avoided for the present.     This, however, is not to say that wemay not be faced once again with these dangers when the investigation by the International Bank has been completed.11, Subject to the foregoing, the outcome of the talks canbe regarded as not unsatisfactory so far as the United Kingdom isconcerned.    Our attitude on some essential points - our limitedability to invest in the scheme or to do so on any equity basis - hasbeen made clear.    It will be to the general advantage to have a fullinvestigation of the scheme and of the economic potentialities of theGold Coast by the International Bank.    The delay which this will involve will not necessarily be disadvantageous;   not only may it bepossible to form a better judgment of the political and economic stability of the Gold Coast in the period following independence, butan improvement in our own economic position may make it morepossible for us to sustain the investment required (and to lend money at lower interest rates).12. On the other hand we are likely still to face formidabledifficulties over this scheme.     There may be much political pressure from disappointed Gold Coast Ministers.     On the economic side two considerations stand out.    The first is that Aluminium Limited clearlywant to restrict their initial commitments on the scheme, although theymight perhaps be brought to modify that attitude somewhat in thelight of the International Bank&apos;s report and of their view of the stability of the Gold Coast.    Although they would accept responsibility for providing the substantial capital required to raise the output of thesmelter from 120, 000 to 210, 000 tons, their attitude of caution,pessimism and limited liability makes the scheme in its early and mosthazardous stages much less attractive to both the Gold Coast and to theUnited Kingdom from the economic standpoint.     The secondconsideration arises from the sheer cost and magnitude of the schemeitself.    Given the relatively limited amounts which are likely to beavailable from the International Bank, the United Kingdom and the aluminium companies, it seems very doubtful indeed whether theresources of the Gold Coast will be able to sustain the burden which willbe involved by meeting the heavy balance of the cost and accepting the residual risk.    It follows that (i) if the scheme is to proceed we shallin any event have to make a substantial investment in it (say, of theorder of  30/40 millions at least);   (ii) we may expect to be pressed bythe Gold Coast to go beyond this at least to the  52 millions contemplated in 1952 and possibly further in order to give the scheme a chance of life.But we may hope that the proposal to ask the International Bank to make an investigation of the whole scheme will be accepted by the Gold coast government and will at least give us a breathing space.F.G.

CONFIDENTIAL ANNEX VRP/L/56/12

VOLTA RIVER PROJECT

Summary of Official Discussions: April, 1956

1. Discussions on the Volta River Project were held in London on 4th - 10th April, 1956 between officials of the United Kingdom and Gold Coast Governments and representatives of Aluminium Limited (of Canada) and the British Aluminium Company. The purpose of the discussions was to take stock of the position in the light of the comprehensive report on the project by the Preparatory Commission and of the proposals submitted by these present.

2. The Commission&apos;s report indicated that the scheme was technically sound and presented no insuperable problems but that the capital cost, at 1955 prices, would be about 60 per cent. above the 1952 estimates; moreover the report recommended that a further allowance of 40 to 50 per cent. should be made to take account of possible increases in cost during the period of construction.

3. The main proposals which had been put forward by the parties were as follows:-

By the United Kingdom Government - that, as the cost of the scheme had greatly increased and the United Kingdom&apos;s ability to contribute had been reduced, stops should be taken to obtain a substantial financial contribution from outside the sterling area, in particular from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

By the Gold Coast Government - (i) That the Gold Coast might wish to participate in the equity of the Smelter Company to a greater extent than was envisaged in 1952; (ii) That a small water royalty should be included in the make up of the power costs; (iii) The rate of tax /on
on the smelter company might be fixed in advance; (iv) Provision should be made to safeguard the interests of the aluminium companies against the contingency of nationalisation for a period of substantial duration.

By Aluminium Limited - That in view of the substantial increase in estimated capital costs together with potential projects elsewhere which were now fully competitive with the Volta scheme, the 1952 framework should be modified. The main revisions proposed were:

(i) The Smelter Company to contract in advance of construction, without a specific guarantee by its share-holders, for blocks of power as needed for aluminium production at a pre-determined fixed unit price not to exceed 0.25d. per K.W.H.

(ii) The smelter to commence operations at a capacity level of 120,000 tons per year, using imported alumina for an initial period (instead of local bauxite).

(iii) That not more than 50 per cent. of the capital cost of the smelter should be financed by equity capital, the balance being in the form of fixed interest capital such as loans and preferred shares subscribed by others than the aluminium companies.

Aluminium Limited stated, without developing the point, that the obligation of the smelter company to offer the larger part of the metal produced to the United Kingdom within a specified price ceiling represented a real handicap to the project.

4. These proposals were further developed by the parties during the discussions. The Gold Coast Delegation explained their proposals about taxation. Aluminium Limited emphasised the possibility of proceeding with schemes in more developed areas /which
which were now quite as attractive as the Volta scheme. Aluminium Limited could not say when they would be able to proceed beyond the 120,000-ton stage but emphasised the desirability of expanding capacity to 210,000 tons as soon as possible as the scheme would only become fully competitive when that stage had been reached. The discussions centred mainly on the proposals put forward by Aluminium Limited since they affected the whole structure of the scheme. It was clear that agreement could be reached on some of the proposals: in particular all parties accepted the idea that the smelter should begin at the 120,000-ton stage of production instead of at 80,000 tons contemplated in 1952. However, three major and continuing difficulties emerged:-

(a) the interest rate to be charged on loans to the power project;

(b) who should bear the risk of the power project;

(c) the method of financing the scheme.

The rate of interest

5. Aluminium Limited said that if the project were to be competitive in relation to other schemes they did not think the power project could be expected to operate (charging 0.25d. per K.W.H.) with interest payments on capital employed of more than 33/4 per cent. This was the rate at which capital could be raised for similar projects being developed in North America. It was however, well below both the current rate (of about 43/4 per cent.) charged by the International Bank and current market rates in the United Kingdom (of about 5-51/2 per cent.) On behalf of the United Kingdom Government it was stated that the Government could not advance moneys at less than the cost of borrowing to itself for a comparable period; if the loan were taken up in instalments each instalment would have to bear the current rate of interest. To accept a differential rate of interest in favour of the Volta scheme would hamper the United /Kingdom&apos;s
Kingdom&apos;s present efforts to restore its economy to a position in which it could continue to provide finance for Commonwealth development. If, over the period of the loan, rates of interest fell and it became possible for the power authority to borrow at a lower rate of interest from some other source, the United Kingdom would be willing to accept repayment - but this would not overcome the immediate difficulty.

The division of risks on the power project

6. Aluminium Limited said that they could no longer undertake to enter the Volta River Project without advance knowledge of the actual cost of power; they considered that the price should be fixed after tenders for the power project had been received but before the project had been constructed; they thought the figure of 0.25d. per K.W.H. would enable the power project to operate profitably at the final stage (with a smelter capacity of 210,000 tons) and they were willing to pay a sur-charge in the earlier stages; a fixed price of 0.25d. would, assuming an interest rate of 33/4 per cent., allow for costs of construction to be 50 per cent. above the 1955 estimates and it was competitive with the prices and terms on which Aluminium Limited could obtain power elsewhere in the world.

7. The Gold Coast delegation said that, while they would want to consult their Ministers on this proposal, they would only be able to accept the principle of a price fixed in advance of construction on certain conditions, in particular that the power contract contained an escalator clause varying the price of power to the extent that the actual cost of construction exceeded or fell short of the tenders. The view of the delegation was that it was wrong in principle for the inflationary risks of the power project to be borne wholly by the parties who financed the project, and not by the smelter company, particularly as the smelter company would be able to protect itself to some extent by raising the selling price of aluminium. /8.
8. Aluminium Limited said, however, that changes in the price of aluminium would not wholly protect them against the general inflationary risks of the project particularly these arising from circumstances in the Gold Coast itself; the construction period for the power project, of 7 years, was much longer than construction periods for competitive projects elsewhere.

9. The United Kingdom delegation said they did not think it would be appropriate for the United Kingdom Government to carry any part of the equity risks in the scheme; such risks should, in fairness, be carried by those who had expectations of sharing the equity profits of the project as a whole, i.e. the Aluminium Companies and the Gold Coast. The United Kingdom and the International Bank (if it agreed to participate) would not share in the equity; they would provide a finite sum of money at a fixed rate of interest. The Gold Coast delegation recognised that in these circumstances their Government would have to consider to what extent they would be prepared to bear the admittedly considerable residual risks of the power project.

The method of finance

10. The difficulty over the method of finance was the result of four separate factors

(a) the rise in estimated costs;

(b) Aluminium Limited&apos;s proposal to reduce their contribution to the smelter at the first stage (120,000 tons);

(c) the United Kingdom&apos;s reduced ability to contribute, and

(d) difficulty of forecasting whether and to what extent the International Bank would participate.

11. The Preparatory Commission estimated that the total cost of the project with a smelter capacity of 120,000 tons would be £185 million at September 1955 prices, compared with the /1952
1952 estimates of £114 million. (The power project would now cost £64 million, the smelter £58 million and public works in the Gold Coast £63 million). There was thus an increase of roughly £70 million but of this the provision of some £24 million would be deferred for five years or so if the proposal to use imported alumina at the start were adopted. At the final stage, with 210,000 tons capacity, the 1955 estimate was £231 million compared with the 1952 estimate of £144 million.

12. The proposals by Aluminium Limited would reduce their contribution to 50 per cent. of the cost of the smelter at the 120,000 ton stage instead of the 65 per cent. envisaged in the 1952 White Paper. The proposal provided, however, that the shareholders of the smelter company would be responsible for providing all the capital needed for expansion from 120,000 tons capacity to the 210,000 tons capacity.

13. The United Kingdom&apos;s ability to contribute to the scheme had been reduced on account of its many other commitments and its serious economic position. The actual sum that the United Kingdom were prepared to provide would depend to a large extent on the finance that was available from outside the sterling area, in particular from the International Bank; the delegation asked for the possibility of finding non-sterling capital for the smelter company to be kept open.

14. In these circumstances, and until the general views of the International Bank were known, it was not possible to draw up a definite scheme of finance comparable with that in the 1952 White Paper.

Other matters discussed

15. A number of other matters arose during the discussions on which further negotiations will be necessary. The most important were the period for which the scheme may be operated using imported alumina instead of local bauxite; the extent to which /freight
O 4 41freight rates should rofloct tho construction and operating costs of Gold Coast railways- when the necessary links, are built to enablolocal bauxite to be usod; tho question whothor tho aluminiumcompanies may undortpJce responsibility for supervising constructionof tho dam and tho railways- so as to retain some control of construction costs;   tho financial structure of the smoltor company,including tho division, between, debenture and equity/ capital andthe Gold Coast minority share of tho equity interests   It was,however, generally considered that a settlement on these matterscould bo negotiated onco tho major difficulties had been: resolved.Conclusions16.    After useful discussions, in which each of tho parties ro-affirmod its interest in tho project,, throe major problems remained,unsettlodj    tho rate of interest, tho terms of tho power contract,the method of finance.     Tho Gold Coast delegation said that beforegoing furthor they would like to report the outcome of thodiscussions to thoir Ministers.   It was generally agreed that itwould be useful to invite the International Bank to consider theVolta scheme in gonoral terms in the light of the reports produced by tho Preparatory Commission, of tho points- which had emergedduring the discussions and of tho magnitude of tho burdens which,tho projoct. would impose.     It was thought that a stage had beenreached at which the- Bank would give useful advice on tho projoctand that much time would bo saved by bringing tho Bank in at a preliminary stago though; it was appreciated that before tho Bankcould offer a loan of a specific amount the outstanding differencesbetweon tho other parties would have to bo resolved.     Tho Bankwould in any case nood to survey tho Gold Coast economy boforegranting &amp; loan.     It was agreed that if Gold Coast Ministersaccoptod this proposal,. Gold Coast officials would consult UnitedKingdom officials about tho method of approaching tho international bank,London, 7.19th April, 1956-
