(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government secret.P. (56) 129 COPY NO. ^ W&apos;25th May, 1956CABINETSPEED LIMIT FOR HEAVY GOODS VEHICLESMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation in his memorandum of 15th December, 1955, (C. P. (55) 201), my predecessor stated the case for raising the speed limit for rigid goods vehicles of over 3 tons unladen weight and for articulated vehicles (butnot for goods vehicles pulling separate trailers) from 20 m.p. h. to30 m,p.h.    He pointed out that the only reason why this change had notbeen made was because of the effect on industrial relations in the industry.He referred to the discussions which he had had with representatives ofthe employers and with the late Mr. Arthur Deakin of the Transport andGeneral Workers Union (T.G.W.U.) and gave it as his opinion that if thechange were made no difficulty was likely to arise either in the &apos;C licencefield or among the British Road Services fleet if sufficient time was givenfor negotiation between the announcement that the speed limit would beraised and the date from which the new limit would come into operation.Difficulty might, however, be expected in the private enterprise sectionof the &apos;A&apos; and fB&apos; licensees, since the Road Haulage Association believedthat the limit ought to be raised on its merits and that negotiations onrevised schedules would then follow.     The T.G.W.U. on the other handwere not in favour of the limit being raised until negotiations on revisedschedules had been completed and satisfactory assurances obtained on the proportions in which the increased productivity would be shared.2.      Since a deadlock had been reached my predecessor proposed tomake an announcement that the speed limit would be raised from a datesome months in advance, as he felt that unless this was done there wouldbe no incentive to either side to enter seriously into negotiations.3.      The Cabinet on 20th December, 1955, approved this recommeada-tion (CM. (55) 47th Conclusions, Minute 6).4.      In C. P. (55) 215, circulated on 31st December, 1955, 1 pointed outthat the death of Mr.&apos; Jock Tiffin, the General Secretary of the T,G,W,U,,had altered the situation, since it would be difficult to secure the supportof Mr. Frank Cousins, his probable successor, for what would be a difficult decision when he was in the middle of his campaign for the generalsecretaryship of the Union.    I therefore asked for and obtained permission to defer an announcement on the speed limit until the new General secretary had been appointed,,5.      Mr. Cousins has now been appointed, and I am. satisfied that itwill no longer be possible to delay making an announcement.    An am end-merit to raise the limit has been put down to the Road Traffic Bill by
1 A.4Mr. Gerald Nabarro, M. P., at the Report Stage in the House of Commonsnext week and, if pressed, it will undoubtedly command wide spread supportamong Conservative Members.    I shall be able to obtain its withdrawalonly if I announce that the limit will be raised on a specific future date,,6.      In the meantime, with the help of the Minister of Labour, I havebeen trying to bring the various parties together and have held one informalmeeting which was attended by representatives of the Road HaulageAssociation, British Road Services and the Transport and General WorkersUnion.    Further negotiations between the parties have taken place and Iam to meet them again on Monday, 28th May, and shall report the outcometo the Cabinet on the following day.7.      If, as my present information indicates, no fxnal agreement isreported to me on 28th May.  I feel strongly that the only hope of the two sides arriving at a workable solution will be to announce that an Order willbe made raising the speed limit for the two classes of vehicles mentionedin paragraph 1 above from 20 to 30 m.p.h. from a date some months inadvance, possibly making the operative date the spring of next year.     an interval of this length ought to enable the details of an agreement to be worked out.    I would at the same time make certain adjustments in the speed limit of heavy locomotives which are at present restricted to5 m.p. h.     This proposal was circulated to representative organisations in1951 and aroused no comment.    It has been held up simply because of its possible repercussions on the 20-mile limit for che 3-ton goods vehicles.There is, of course, the risk that, if an announcement of this kind ismade before an agreement is reached even in principle, the Unions mayput forward a pay claim based on the new schedules and rates of pay which they claim should arise from a change in the speed limit.8.      The pressure of public opinion to raise the limit is, however, so strong and the arguments in favour so cogent that in my view this riskought to be accepted,  and I therefore seek the approval of the Cabinet forthe course which I have recommended.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation,W.l.25th May, 1956.
