Printed for the Cabinet.  May 19560 p*00CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 5 3CP. (56) 12115th May, 1956CABINETANGLO-SOVIET DISCUSSIONS ON  LAOSMemorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues may wish to know the positions reached in the discussions which Lord Reading has been conducting with the Russians on Laos.2. These discussions have made no progress and, unless the SovietGovernment are prepared to modify their position, it seems that we should breakthem off at the next meeting, which is now likely to take place after Whitsun.3. The Geneva Agreements provided that the full sovereignty of the LaotianGovernment should be re-established throughout the country. The CommunistPathet Lao forces (a body numbering some 5-6,000 men) have persistentlyrefused to permit the restoration of the Laotian Governments administration inthe two northern provinces in which these forces were concentrated, as a provisionalmeasure, after the cease-fire.4. The Laotian Government can clearly not re-establish their authority bya full-scale resort to force. For eighteen months they have been trying to negotiate a political settlement in direct talks with the Pathet Lao. Although the InternationalSupervisory Commission in Laos unanimously upheld the Laotian Governmentsright to the administration of the two provinces as long ago as June 1955, thePathet Lao have refused all proposals made by the Government.5. The International Commission accordingly passed a resolution on 7th January, 1956, recommending the immediate restoration of the LaotianGovernments administration. (The Indian and Canadian Commissioners voted in favour; the Pole abstained.) The Pathet Lao refused to accept this formalrecommendation and the Commission accordingly referred the question to theCo-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference in accordance with the procedure laiddown in the cease-fire agreement. The Commission have also sent a special reportto the Co-Chairmen in which they ask for guidance on how to proceed in theirendeavour to bring about a settlement.6. In the course of the discussions on Laos the Soviet representative hasadhered inflexibly to the view that the Co-Chairmen should confine themselvessimply to telling the Laotian Government and the Pathet Lao to resume direct negotiations. This the Pathet Lao claim to be ready to do, but they will not acceptthe condition that the Laotian Governments administration be restored in thetwo provinces. On the other hand the Laotian Government have made it acondition of resuming talks that these shall proceed on the basis of the resolution of 7th January. The Soviet representative has refused to express either approvalor disapproval of the Commission^ resolution of 7th January, or to make anymention of it except to note its existence in a message to the two parties. lord reading has maintained the position that the Co-Chairmen must support theCommission^ authority and give the Commission the guidance they seek, unless they are satisfied that the position taken up by the Commission cannot be justified,49922
and that, as the parties have wholly failed to reach agreement hitherto, theCo-Chairmen should indicate a line on which they could resume negotiations.To these ends the Co-Chairmen should endorse the Commission^ resolution of 7th January and tell the Pathet Lao to accept it. The Soviet representative has given no satisfactory reply to Lord Reading&apos;s argument.7. To accept the Soviet viewpoint would be to let down the authority of theCommission and also to give away the advantage of their support for the LaotianGovernments case. The Laotian Government will no doubt be disappointed if nothing emerges from the Co-Chairmen&apos;s discussions, although we warned them not to expect much. But they will lose little from a prolongation of the presentdeadlock compared with what they would lose from any pronouncement by theCo-Chairmen which did not support either the 7th January resolution or theprinciple of their right to exercise undivided sovereignty.8. The Soviet refusal to support the International Commission on an issuewhere their authority is being flouted by the Communists may have a salutary effect on the Indian Government, who are being kept fully informed of the talks.9. I have accordingly authorised Lord Reading to break off the discussions ifthe Soviet Ambassador maintains his present attitude. We shall in this case make public the reasons for the break. This difference with the Russians follows so soon after the visit of Mr. Bulganin and Mr. Khrushchev and also after the fairly satisfactory conclusion of the discussions on Vietnam that I have thought it rightto bring it to notice.S.
