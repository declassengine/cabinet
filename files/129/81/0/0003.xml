am/Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1956SECRETCopy No.   5 2CP. (56) 10325th April, 1956CABINETCOAL prices memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power in the memorandum on coal investment (CP. (56) 87) which I submitted tothe Cabinet last month I drew attention to the deficits of the National Coal Boardand the necessity, if the deficits were not to go on mounting, of a coal price increase this year.2. The Board are now about to publish their statement of accounts for 1955and have sent me estimates of their financial prospects for 1956 and 1957. Asummary of the essential figures is given in Annex I. These show that the Board,having started 1956 with an accumulated deficit of  37 millions, expect to lose 11 millions this year and over  54 millions in 1957 on the basis of present prices.A striking feature is that the total wage bill in 1957 will be no less than  62 millions(6s. a ton) higher than in 1955. This reflects the latest settlement (February 1956)with the day wage men, costing  15 millions per annum, and the consequentialadvance in piece-work rates as the piece workers endeavour to maintain theirdifferential.3. The increase in the wage bill this year over last is of the order of9 per cent., while the increase in productivity is negligible. Productivity could beincreased if either discipline in the pits were to improve or if past investment wereto show fruit. But there is no immediate prospect of either. In these circumstances there are only two ways of meeting the resulting current deficit increasedborrowing from the Exchequer (which would be tantamount to a subsidy) or increased prices.4. It will be recalled that, in order to finance their long-term investment programme, the Board had asked for an increased borrowing power of  400 millions.The additional borrowing power agreed to and now inserted in the Coal industry bill is  350 millions. The reduction was made on the ground that it was undesirable for the accumulated deficit to be carried indefinitely by Exchequerlending. Tf the Board are to make a contribution towards wiping off the accumulated deficit, in present circumstances of stationary productivity, such a contribution can come only from increased prices.5. There are several reasons why a price increase should be sooner ratherthan later. First, the sooner it is, the smaller it need be; the longer it is delayed,the greater it must become. Secondly, the sooner it is, the more firmly can it be associated in the public mind with its main cause the wage advances. Thirdly,it remains highly desirable to compress coal consumption, particularly since theMiddle Eastern situation is likely to slow up the conversion to oil.6. The Board&apos;s application is for an increase of 8 per cent, on pithead prices(averaging 6s. a ton) from 1st June. The effect on the Board&apos;s finances is shown in annex I and the consequences for other industries are shown in Annex II.Regrettable though the application is, I recommend, after consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, that it be agreed to. The horse is out of the stable,and the farther we allow it to roam the more difficult it will be to catch up with it.A. J.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,23rd April, 1956.49837
