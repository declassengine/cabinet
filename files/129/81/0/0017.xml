(56) 11710th May, 1956CABINETDISARMAMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsBACKGROUND:  DISARMAMENT DISCUSSIONS, 1955-56The Anglo-French Plan of June 1954 held the field until 10th May, 1955. TheSoviet Government then seized the initiative with a new proposal whichincorporated many Anglo-French ideas, but remained unacceptable on control.For the first time, so far as the Soviet Union was concerned, it conceded the impossibility of verifying accurately past production of nuclear weapons ormaterial. Following the change in the Soviet position, the United StatesGovernment decided to put all their past proposals &quot; on a reserved and inactivestatus,&quot;&apos; while a complete re-examination of American disarmament policy wasconducted: this re-examination was not completed till March 1956. In the autumnHer Majesty&apos;s Government, recognising the nuclear difficulties and in an effort to regain the initiative, promoted the idea of partial disarmament. The UnitedKingdom Delegation piloted through the General Assembly a resolution, whichwas eventually supported by all members of the United Nations except the soviet bloc, proposing that the Disarmament Sub-Committee should continue to seek agreement on a comprehensive disarmament scheme but should give priority to&quot; such measures of adequately safeguarded disarmament as are now feasible.&quot;2. United Kingdom experts thereupon devised a partial disarmament plansuitable for carrying out in existing world conditions (see summary at Annex I).This was shown to the United States Government in Washington at the time ofthe Prime Ministers visit, but the Americans were unable to promise support for it as their own re-examination was still incomplete, and the Pentagon was thenopposing any reduction in American forces. M. Moch meantime announcedthat the United Kingdom Plan was totally unacceptable to the French Governmentbecause it provided for no nuclear and only partial conventional disarmament.He said that he would put forward, by himself if necessary, a revised version of theAnglo-French Plan (see Annex II). Because of the danger of the French driftinginto the Russian camp, it was decided that we should drop our own partial plan and co-sponsor the revised Anglo-French Plan provided it was modified to protectour interests.3. At the last moment the Americans announced that they objected to certain features in the revised Anglo-French Plan and would be compelled to table separateproposals of their own. Further modifications were made in the Anglo-FrenchPlan to soothe American apprehensions, but, as the Disarmament Sub-Committeewas due to start, it was decided that the Anglo-French Plan must be tabled and thatthe Americans would also introduce a one-stage plan for partial disarmament,including nuclear (see Annex III).4. The Anglo-French Plan was tabled on 19th March and the American plan on 3rd April. Meantime on 27th March the Soviet Delegation tabled a new plan(Annex IV) which was remarkable in that contrary to the trend of soviet propaganda for the past ten years it provided for no nuclear disarmament but forconventional disarmament down to a million to a million-and-a-half force levelsfor the United States, Soviet Union and China, and 650,000 for Britain and France.49898b
These reductions were to be carried out within three years. These are the threeplans before the Disarmament Sub-Committee which has now sent an interimreport to the Disarmament Commission in accordance with that body&apos;instructions.Soviet and Western Objectives5. The Soviet visit and the Sub-Committee discussions have revealed that theRussians have the following objectives. They want to obtain the economic benefits of conventional disarmament without effective control and without sacrificing theirnuclear weapons programme. No doubt they would also like, if it were possible,to get Allied forces reduced, prior to any political settlements, to levels which wouldmean the withdrawal of United States forces from Europe, the continued divisionof Germany, and the disruption of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. they also doubtless wish to make German rearmament as difficult as possible.6. The objective of the revised Anglo-French Plan, on the other hand, hasbeen (a) to provide for as much conventional and nuclear disarmament as can be effectively controlled; and(b) to do so by a system of phasing which would (i) protect our nuclear defence programme, and(ii) ensure that the later stages of disarmament would not be carriedout until political settlements had been reached on issues suchas German reunification.No time limits or figures for force levels are mentioned in the Anglo-French Plan.7. The United States Plan is a partial disarmament plan, proposing thereduction of the forces of the three largest Powers to 2-5 millions and of Franceand the United Kingdom to 750,000, along with a ban on the manufacture offurther material for nuclear weapons. This plan would be carried out beforemajor political settlements had been reached but would be accompanied by an elaborate control system. Thus the American Plan is for a short-term and theAnglo-French for a long-term approach to the problem. The Anglo-French Plancontemplates (a) ultimate force levels considerably lower than the American first stagefigure of 2-5 millions; and(b) ultimately more severe nuclear prohibitions.Situation in the Sub-committee. The Sub-Committee have made no progress in reconciling these threeplans, largely because of the Soviet Representative^ refusal to give an inch on hisown plan. Indeed, the Soviet leaders have scoffed at the Sub-Committee and havehinted that they will go ahead with large-scale unilateral reductions from whichdoubtless they hope to reap both economic and propaganda benefits. As theprospects of agreement are remote, the Sub-Committee discussions have becomeprimarily a battle of propaganda. The Russians have gained considerable advantage through claiming that when they accepted our earlier figures for forcelevels, we immediately disowned them, and that when they stopped emphasisingnuclear disarmament we began to say it was essential.9. Both these allegations are untrue. The United States figure of 2 - 5 million men applies to the first stage of reductions and is not necessarily incompatible with the Soviet figure of 1 - 5 millions for the final stage: we merely insist thatprecise levels for the final stage should be left for future negotiation. Further,we have always insisted that nuclear disarmament must form part of a comprehensive plan. To drop the nuclear question altogether is. therefore no concession to us. Nor is it a solution for it would simply stimulate an ever-growing number of countries to join in the nuclear arms race.10. In fact, it is the Russians who have retreated on several counts. Theyhave dropped the link, which was recognised in their 1955 proposals, between thegrowth of international confidence through political settlements and the fulfilment of large-scale disarmament.   Secondly, they have dropped the link between
conventional and nuclear disarmament which they had borrowed from the Anglo-French Plan and included in their 1955 proposals. They have also failed to meet us on control for they have flatly refused to agree to aerial surveys and they denyadequate rights of enforcement and access to the agents of the control organisation.11. We, on the other hand, have made certain concessions to them. the revised Anglo-French Plan includes for the first time provisions for limiting and eventually prohibiting nuclear test explosions. We have also brought the start of reductions in forces and armaments into the first stage, which formerly onlyprovided for freezing force levels. In addition the French offered to consider apossible synthesis of the different plans, but the Russians have shown no interestin this idea.12.   In our propaganda therefore we should (a) counter any Soviet unilateral reductions by pointing out that they arelong overdue and cannot be verified. The Russians will also presumablydecline to say how much these reductions leave behind and we shouldnot be shy of saying it for them. They may also make no mention ofany corresponding reductions in armaments and we should exposethis omission;(b) point out what we have done in the way of unilateral disarmament;(c) stress the difference between unilateral reductions for reasons of national economy and reductions by international agreement and under propercontrol;(d) expose Soviet misrepresentations about so-called Allied retreats and pointout where Soviets have gone back on former positions;(e) reaffirm the willingness of the West to seek agreement within the united nations despite the Russian gibes at the Sub-Committee;(/) stress the reasonableness of the Anglo-French Plan as a constructive,balanced and realistic proposal for achieving by stages as muchdisarmament as can be effectively controlled;(g) indicate our future policy.Future Policy13. As to our future policy there are two possibilities. We might stand firm on the Anglo-French Plan. But it has already been rejected outright by the soviet representative and it is not endorsed by the United States. It is also weakenedas a propaganda weapon by the fact that we are unable to include specific figuresfor force reductions in each of its stages. Moreover, latest reports suggest thatthe troubles in North Africa are making the French back away from specificcommitments to reduce their force levels. Therefore, although we should not abandon this plan as a long-term framework for the whole process, is there notadvantage in putting forward some short-term alternative?14. Such an alternative would be to try to produce a new partial disarmamentplan which could at least in theory be operated immediately and might takethe wind out of the sails of the Russian announcement of their unilateral reductions.Such a proposal could provide (on the lines of the present United States Plan) forimmediate reductions, under agreed controls, to 2 - 5 millions for the three largestPowers and 750,000 (including Colonial troops) for the United Kingdom andFrance, with the promise of some nuclear disarmament at a stage which wouldnot endanger our own development plans. It may not be easy to evolve a set ofconcrete measures which both the Americans and the French would accept. the nuclear component will pose special difficulties. Our own purely national interest might suggest cutting out nuclear aspects altogether. But it seems certain that both the Americans and French will insist on some nuclear element being included,and the advantages of having a united Western front are so great that it may be worth making a further effort along these lines.15. If this view is accepted, a problem of timing arises. It would take sometime to agree a new proposal in consultation with the other Western Governments.The Sub-Committee have just adjourned, and it seems impracticable to put sucha proposal to the Russians through diplomatic channels. To do so would only result in an extremely complicated battle of notes. Besides the disarmament commission will probably meet in mid-June to consider the Sub-Committee&apos;sreport.   I therefore suggest we should launch any new ideas in the Commission.49898
16. It is, of course, possible that the Soviet Government may have announced their unilateral reductions before the Commission meets. But this would make it all the more important for the West to launch some counter-initiative, in additionto discounting the Soviet reductions as long overdue.17. I know that some of my colleagues think that the Soviet Union at presentseem to have the advantage in the argument. I agree that there is a danger ofthis. The reason of course is that, so long as the Russians were unwilling todisarm, we were able to maintain.a good Cold War position. Now, however, thesituation has changed, and the Russians appear to have concluded that it is notonly safe but aiso economically desirable for them to disarm. At the same timethe United States have told us that they are thinking in the absence of anagreement of increasing rather than reducing their military effort. We must therefore face the fact that we are confronted with far greater difficulties to-day in presenting our position. For these reasons I recommend that we make at oncean effort to get Allied agreement on a plan such as is set out in paragraph 14 above.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. I,8th May, 1956.ANNEX I summary OF UNITED KINGDOM PARTIAL plan the United Kingdom partial plan has only one stage. The order of eventsis:  v,(i) The setting up of a world-wide control organisation.(ii) A world-wide freeze of levels of armed forces  and conventionalarmaments.(iii) Introduction and expansion of controls at ports, airports, &amp;c, and throughaerial and ground surveys.(iv) Report by the control organisation that it is ready to supervise reductions.(v) Reductions of forces and conventional armaments to agreed levels.(These were not specified but the suggested figures were 2-5 millions for the United States and the Soviet Union and 750,000 for the UnitedKingdom and France.)(vi) Imposition of light checks, through auditing, on the manufacture of nuclear material. (N.B. This was to disclose rates of production,but not to prohibit or limit the manufacture of nuclear weapons.)(vii) A conference to consider the possibility of agreeing on more disarmament.ANNEX ii summary  OF   REVISED   ANGLO-FRENCH   plan the revised Anglo-French plan for comprehensive disarmament, in bothconventional and nuclear weapons, has three stages. Passage from one stage tothe next would depend on a unanimous decision of the Executive Committee ofthe Disarmament Organisation that the provisions of the previous stage were completed, that the control organ was equipped to supervise the next stage andthat the necessary conditions of international confidence existed. There is also a clause for suspending some or all of the obligations of the Treaty if an irregularityunder Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter (threats to the peace and breaches of the peace) occurs.2. Stage I consists of (i) setting up the control organisation; (ii) a world-wide&quot; freeze &quot; on levels of armed forces and conventional armaments; (iii) simultaneous
introduction of controls at ports, airports, &amp;c, and through aerial and groundsurveys; (iv) a world conference to determine the disarmament obligations of smallPowers; (v) initial reductions to previously agreed levels by the five Great Powers.[No figures are mentioned in the plan, but the United Kingdom has acceptedthe United States first-stage figures of 2 - 5 millions for the three largest Powersand 750,000 for France and the United Kingdom.]3. Stage II consists of (i) a limitation on nuclear test explosions as soon ascontrol arrangements are agreed; (ii) completion of the first half of the reductions of the Great Powers; (iii) start of reductions by small Powers; (iv) developmentof the control organisation to cope with the nuclear disarmament in the followingstage.4. Stage III consists of (i) the prohibition of nuclear test explosions andprohibition of the manufacture of nuclear weapons; (ii) carrying out of the thirdquarter of reductions by the Great Powers; (iii) immediately thereafter a completeprohibition on the use of nuclear weapons; (iv) completion of the reductions byall participating States; (v) allocation of a proportion of budgetary savings to theimprovement of living standards throughout the world.5. Final measures would provide for a scientific conference to examine thepossibilities of eliminating stocks of nuclear weapons and for a review of thepossibility of further reductions in armed forces and armaments.ANNEX IIISUMMARY OF UNITED STATES WORKING PAPER OF 3rd april the United States proposal describes a first phase of a comprehensive plan.It begins with two practical tests of control: (i) an exchange of technical missions;and (ii) reciprocal ground and air surveys in limited areas in the United States and soviet Union. While working out a universal agreement, the five members of theDisarmament Sub-Committee would together agree on reduced levels of armed forces and conventional armaments for themselves. The levels of forces would be2 - 5 millions for the United States, the Soviet Union and China, 750,000 for theUnited Kingdom and France. The levels for other States would be fixed later andwould not exceed 500,000. They would also agree upon a control organisationincluding controls at ports, airports, &amp;c, and aerial and ground surveys.2. The process would begin with a freeze of the armed forces and conven-tional armaments of the five Powers on the Sub-Committee, plus suitable controls.Later the reductions of all States would begin simultaneously and the control organisation would become world-wide.3. When the Disarmament Organisation had reported that it was ready to account for future production of nuclear material and this report had been confirmed by the Executive Committee, all future production of such material would be used for peaceful purposes only. States with nuclear weapons would inaddition transfer from past production agreed amounts of material to peaceful uses.Further, a limitation would be imposed on nuclear test explosions.4. At the end a conference would be held to make recommendations on further disarmament.ANNEX IVSUMMARY OF SOVIET PROPOSALS OF 27th MARCH, 1956The latest Soviet proposals deal only with conventional disarmament. they provide for the following measures in 1956-58: (i) during the first three months a world-wide &quot;freeze&quot; of armed forces and conventional armaments at levels
obtaining on 31st December, 1955; (ii) reductions by annual instalments of the armed forces of the five Great Powers to the following levels: the United States,the Soviet Union and China 1 to \\ million men, France and the United Kingdom650,000 men; (iii) corresponding reductions in conventional armaments; (iv) a world conference to determine force levels for the small Powers below a ceiling of200,000 men; (v) allocation of savings to improve living standards throughout theworld.2. The control machinery would include (i) control posts at ports, airports,&amp;c, and ground inspectors with access to military units, armament factories, &amp;c.;(ii) at a &quot; specified stage &quot; the participating States should &quot; consider the possibilityof using aerial photography &quot;; (iii) the control officials would be positioned &quot; in good time &quot; to supervise the operation of the agreement; (iv) in the event ofviolations of the agreement, the control organisation would recommendappropriate counter-measures to the Security Council.3. The Soviet proposals contain two other sections listing preliminarymeasures which might be undertaken prior to a disarmament agreement: a zone of limitation and inspection of armed forces and armaments in the two Germanysand adjacent States; the withdrawal of all nuclear weapons from forces inGermany; a ban on thermo-nuclear test explosions; and a 15 per cent, cut in military budgets.
