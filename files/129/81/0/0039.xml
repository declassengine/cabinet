THE BRITISH TRANSPORT commission memorandum by the Minister of Transport and civil AviationThis note is a progress report on a difficult and complex operation.It also makes a proposal as to the action to be taken in, or about,September which marks the end of the six months deferment period ofsome of the British Transport Commission^ proposals to increasecharges.2.     In September or early October I shall have to deal fully with theCommission^ financial position and future prospects.    Public opinionwill have to be persuaded that the deferment of increases in charges was justified, and - more important - that the Commission will, in time, beable to put their own house in order without subsidy and without majorlegislative change.     The Report and Accounts to be published at the endof June will reveal that the Commission had in 1955 a deficit of 30.6 millions, bringing their accumulated deficit to  69.7 millions.In spite of the increase in charges earlier this year to yield - it was hoped -an additional  20 millions a year, the accumulated deficit at the end of1956 is likely to be well over  100 millions.3.     I have made no secret of the fact that the Commission will have great difficulty in meeting this position through further increases in charges.    There are already signs that charges, particularly for railway freight, are approaching their economic limit.     The demand for theCommission^ services is highly sensitive to price.     The railways, whichcomprise by far the greater part of the Commission^ services, areoperated in keen competition with road transport and if charges for the competitive traffics are pitched, too high, consignors will send theirgoods by road.    Road transport has many inherent advantages which therailways lack, such as low capital costs, convenience and flexibility,and is attracting certain traffics away from the railways at a disturbingrate.    The Commission^ prospect of reversing the present loss oftraffics to the roads must now depend on their ability to price their services within the economic limit (which means that they must absorbtheir increased costs through increased efficiency) and at the same timeto make those services more attractive to the business community.There are, in addition, other considerations which limit the possibleincreases for non-competitive traffic.secret.P. (56) 139COPY NO.8th. June, 1956CABINET4.     I do not want to give the impression that the railways areinherently inefficient and unprofitable.     This is certainly not so.    Ifwe can make a success of the operation we are now planning, the long
i 9 oterm future of the railways can be as assured as their present position isdifficult.    But to achieve this end public confidence must be restored inthe railways or we will find it increasingly difficult to obtain acceptanceof the heavy capital investment ( 1, ZOO millions) in railway modernisa-tion and they will not attract the necessary passenger and freighttraffics.5.      I think that we could best help to meet these objectives by thepublication of a White Paper which would show the causes of theCommission^ present financial difficulties, the measures the Governmentand the Commission intend to take to redress the position and the promise of the long term outlook.6.     V/e must expect the Commission, however hard they try, tocontinue in heavy deficit for some time to come.     They will certainlypropose to increase some passenger fares in the autumn and freight charges as soon after this as seems opportune, but I understand that on present estimates the Commission do not think they can count on realisingmuch more than  15 millions a year from these.    If they try for morethey will only lose more traffics to the roads and forfeit more good willfrom their customers.    It is now expected that the new merchandisecharges scheme will come into operation about the middle of next yearand will gradually help further to reduce the gap.    In addition I intend to continue to exert all possible pressure on the Commission to reducecosts by intensifying their programme for eliminating uneconomicservices and by increasing productivity.    But even if favourable results are obtained from these measures and from the gradually mountingbenefits of modernisation, I do not believe that the Commission will beable to balance their current account for a number of years.    Moreoverthis forecast assumes that further pay increases will stem only fromimprovements in results and not from national wage movements.    Onthis basis the White Paper may also prove to be a convenient backgroundagainst which this autumn&apos;s railway pay claims can be examined.7.      The alternatives to continuing annual deficits for some time are,of course, subsidy in some form or the restriction of the railways&apos;competitors in the road transport industry.    I do not commend either ofthese courses to my colleagues.    Instead I am discussing with theChancellor of the Exchequer the problem of the Commission^accumulated deficit, which will include the interest on the costs of the modernisation programme before it can bear fruit.    I have it in mind that if the Commission can show that in due course they will be able to turn the corner, they should be allowed to transfer the substantialdeficit which will have accumulated during this period of rehabilitationand development since 1940 to a special account and that it should bemade clear (by legislation if need be) that by doing so the commission would not be deemed to have defaulted on their obligation to recovertheir full costs chargeable to revenue, taking one year with another.Although this change would make no difference to the Commission^financial position, it would show more clearly the healthier andpromising state of their current operations and undoubtedly have a beneficial psychological effect on the staff.8.      The presentation of the situation and of the measures proposedto carry the Commission through to the break-even point will need careful handling.    But I do not think we should shrink from a realistic
exposition.    We can show that the causes of the railways&apos; difficulties go back thirty years when obsolescence set in;   how the process ofobsolescence and under-investment continued through the war and duringthe post-war years of capital shortage;  why the Transport Act, 1947,in nationalising the railways and part of the road transport industry,provided inadequately for the full development of either form of transport,and that it was not until the Transport Act, 1953 that, thanks to theeffects of my predecessors, the right basic organisation was providedfor rail and road transport.     The Commission^ continuing deficits mustbe presented as the reflection, not of an inherently weak financial position,but of a long period of rehabilitation and reconstruction, during which -like many big businesses - they have had to provide considerable funds to carry them over lean years before they can get on their feet.    Theacceptance of continuing deficits for some years is probably stretching theAct of 1947 more than its originators intended, but I think this would beaccepted if the White paper also included a programme which showedclearly how the break-even point can and will be reached.9.      Accordingly I seek the agreement of my colleagues to the publica-tion in the late summer or early autumn of a White Paper which willstate the facts about the Commission^ plans for the future and put itspresent financial difficulties in perspective.    If my colleagues agreewith this proposal, I should hope to have a draft ready for consideration before the House rises for the summer recess.H.W.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation,W.l.8th June, 1956.
