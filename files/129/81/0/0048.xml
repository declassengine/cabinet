i t b(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)- -__-----------------------------------------------------------------------secret.P. (56) 148 COPY NO.  UTjr15th June, 1956CABINETSTAMP ISSUES FOR SCOTLAND, NORTHERN IRELANDAND wales memorandum by the Postmaster-GeneralThe Home Affairs Committee have considered and given a measureof support to a proposal that the Post Office should issue new stamps inthe 2-jrd. , 4d. and Is. 3d. denominations for Scotland, Wales and NorthernIreland and a 2-*d. stamp each for the Channel Islands and the Isle ofMan (H. P. (56) 12th Meeting, Item 5), and I have been invited to seek theviews of the Cabinet.2.      The sale of each series of such stamps would be confined to PostOffices in these several areas, all series being valid for postage and revenue anywhere in the United Kingdom.    Such stamps would conform to the general pattern of existing stamps, with the head of the Sovereignas the dominant feature.     The border - and this only - would bearsymbols or designs appropriate to the country or area of origin.3.      In favour of the proposal it can be urged that:-(a) it would introduce a desirable variety into the design of the United Kingdom issue without abandoning the traditions of dignity and simplicity;(b) the financial gain to the Post Office of such an issuemight be of the order of  4- million or rather more;(c) the issue of such stamps might well make an appeal inthe countries concerned, and to people of Scottish,Irish and Welsh descent overseas.     The wish tomake some such change exists in quarters whichwould be by no means willing to accept the lable&quot;nationalist&quot;.    The change might well be regardedas an imaginative and popular step.4.      An objection to the proposal may be that it might encourageextreme nationalist elements.    It might, on the other hand, have the opposite effect by giving satisfaction to the many who, while not holding&quot;nationalist&quot; views, are warmly attached to their country of birth.The dominance of the Sovereign&apos;s head on all stamps would symbolisethe unity which,  combined with diversity, provides the continuingstrength of the British tradition.
-f Pi r-i5.      The variety in design of the stamps would be limited by the need to retain the traditions that the United Kingdom stamp issues always bear the portrait of the Sovereign and never bear the name of the country of origin.    If the idea be approved, committees, representative ofcultural and artistic interests in the countries concerned, would beinvited to advise on designs appropriate for submission to Her majesty the Queen for approval,,6.      I should be glad to know whether I would have the support of mycolleagues in submitting such a proposal for Her Majesty*s approval.C.K,General Post Office, E. C. 1.15th June, 1956.
