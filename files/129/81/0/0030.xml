S.L.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.28th May, 1956.SECRET COPY NO.CP. (56) 13029th May, 1956.CABINETSOMALIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Cabinet on 15th May invited me to consider what prospectthere might be of securing an extension of Italian trusteeship for Somalia(CM. (56) 36th Conclusions, Minute 3).2.        It is clear that the attempt to secure such an extension wouldbe fraught with difficulty.3.        The United Nations decided, by a resolution passed in 1949,that Somalia should become independent by I960.     Any extension of italian trusteeship would require the rescinding of this resolution by a two-thirds majority.     This would involve a full-dress debate in theUnited Nations and our Permanent Representative reports that amajority of members would undoubtedly oppose any attempt to repeal the1949 resolution.    Without succeeding, we should provoke accusationsof suppression of national aspirations.4.        Moreover, the Italians do not appear to want their trusteeshipextended.     They have made it clear in official discussions that they donot intend to remain in Somalia after I960 (although they may be preparedto continue some sort of financial assistance).      They would only conside?continuing their responsibilities if persuaded to do so by a majority ofPowers, and even then would be bound to take into account the wishes ofthe inhabitants of Somalia.    They would be very unlikely to accept anypostponement of their promised independence.5.        I recommend therefore that this proposal should not befurther pursued.
