NUCLEAR TESTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe decision of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to make thermo-nuclear weapons was announced in the Statement on Defence, 1955;  but no announce-rnent about the proposed test of these weapons in the spring of 1957 has beenmade.Z.      The question of making an announcement has been under reviewbecause the concealment of preparations had become increasingly difficult, and in particular because the absence of an announcement is causing difficulty to the American Government, whose goodwill is ofcruci?! importance to the operation.     This is first because the base forthe trials will be on Chxlstmas Island, the sovereignty of which is thesubject of a passive dispute between the Americans and oursslves;   and secondly because we have had to ask a United States airline to leaveChristmas Island after they had spent a substantial sum of money onpreparing to use the Island.3.      A new factor has now entered the situation, namely the findings ofthe Committee of the Medical Research Council (M.R.C.) on &quot;The Hazardsto Man of Nuclear and Allied Radiations&quot;.     This Committee was set uplast year by the M.R.C. at the invitation of the Government (Hansard,29th March, 1955, Col. 197).    Its report will be published on 12th June -a date which cannot be altered significantly if the British report is (as isdesirable) to appear at approximately the same time as the report of aparallel enquiry conducted in the United States by the National Academyof Sciences.4.      On the question of genetic effects of radiation arising from testexplosions of nuclear weapons, the report will be more reassuring thanpublic opinion expects.     The present and foreseeable damage fromexternal radiation to be expected from fall-out consequent upon weapontesting is negligible.     The report does, however, draw attention to possible dangers arising from internal radiation due to the release intest explosions of radio-active strontium, on which its conclusion isas follows:-&quot;At its present level, no detectable increase in the incidence of ill-effects is to be expected.    Nevertheless,recognising all the inadequacy of our present knowledge,we cannot ignore the possibility that, if the rate of firingincreases and particularly if greater numbers of thermo -nuclear weapons are used, we could, within the lifetime ofsome now living, be approaching levels at which ill-effectsmight be produced in a small number of the population. &quot;The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of.......................TOP SECRET Copy No.C.

in .      This conclusion is likely to evoke much interest and may lead torenewed pressure for the cessation of all tests.    But, as the PrimeMinister said in his broadcast on 21st January,  &quot;You cannot prove   a bomb until it has exploded&quot;.    The abandonment of the proposed thermo-nuclear tests would therefore have far-reaching effects on both theforeign and defence policies of the United Kingdom.6.      The view of an American expert on the hazard from radio -strontium is that ill-effects are unlikely to be noticeable unlessthe level rises 100 times higher than that considered definitely dangerousby the M.R.C. Committee (i. e. 1 0, OOOunits rather than 100 units).    Worldscientific opinion, and a substantial body of United States scientificopinion, is likely to agree with the M.R.C,    In view of the exchangesthat took place at the White House on 8th February, during the PrimeMinister&apos;s visit to Washington, we have warned the Americans of theposition which faces Her Majesty&apos;s Government.7.      I therefore recommend that my colleagues should:-(1)    maintain their decision of 22nd February to carryout a series of thermo-nuclear tests in the spring of 1957;(2)    agree that an announcement about these testsshould be made in Parliament before theMedical Research CounciPs report is published on 12th June;(3)    agree  that this announcement should include astatement to the effect that Her Majestyrs Govern-ment have decided to initiate further discussions on nuclear test explosions, designed to lead to agreement on their control and limitation;(4) agree that the United States Government shouldbe informed in advance of these decisions andof the terms of the statement to be made.8.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF THEMEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL ON &quot;THE HAZARDS TOMAN OF NUCLEAR AND ALLIED RADIATIONS&quot;I.   Excerpts from Summary of Genetic SectionEffects of increased mutation on the incidence of disease in human populationsThe role of heredity in the production of disease ranges fromthat of a predisposing to that of a preponderating cause.    The effects which might be expected to result from an increase in mutation ratescan most easily be calculated for diseases known to be caused by singlegenes, but for relatively few such diseases have we sufficient evidenceof the kind upon which such a calculation must be based.2.      Mental diseases, the most important single category in whichhereditary causes are known to be important, account in all for nearly half the hospital population of the country.    There are grounds for believing that a doubling of the mutation rates of the genes concernedwith their causation would, in one generation, increase the frequency of low-grade mental deficiency by three per cent, and of the two principaltypes of mental illness, schizophrenia and manic depressive reaction,by about one per cent.    If the mutation rates were to remain at twicetheir present values, the incidence of mental diseases might on themost pessimistic assumption double also, but would only attain thisvalue after very many generations.3.      When all serious illnesses with a hereditary element in theircausation are taken into account, it is unlikely that the burden put uponsociety by a doubling of mutation rates would exceed by more than a fewtimes the contribution made by the increase of mental disease.4.      It must be remembered that a harmful recessive gene givesno outward evidence of its presence until chance brings it together with another of its kind.    The crop of newly mutated recessive genes causedby an increase of mutation rates could, however, cause suffering overmany generations before all were finally eliminated..... . . &apos;. .        . ,   . ... &apos;     &apos;       . ... ....       :        .      .    &apos;.      .    &apos;Dose of radiation to double mutation rate5.      The evidence at our disposal, though far from adequate, leadsus to conclude that there is little likelihood that the real value for the doubling dose for human genes lies between 3 r and 15 r;   and that,although we cannot exclude the possibility that for some human genesthe doubling dose may be less than 30 r and for others more than 80 r,the best estimate that we can make, in the light of present knowledge isthat the value in general lies somewhere between 30 r and 80 r.&apos;     &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;      &apos;6.      Even if the doubling dose were as low as the minimum we can reasonably entertain namely 15 r, it is extremely improbable that in times of peace more than a small fraction of the population could receive an extra dose of this size.    The frequency of naturally-occurringhereditary abnormalities is such that, if comparatively few individuals
received such a dose, there would be no noticeable effect on their immediate offspring or on their descendants for several centuries.For levels of radiation up to the doubling dose, and even some waybeyond, the genetic effects of radiation are only appreciable whenreckoned over the population as a whole, and need not cause alarm tothe individual on his own account.II.   Excerpts from Assessment of the Hazardsof Exposure to RadiationTest explosions of nuclear weaponsIt is impossible to explode a nuclear weapon without liberatingradio-active matter into the atmosphere.    As described in the chapteron exposure levels, the radio-active material diffuses all over the world and in the course of time gradually deposits on the surface of the earthand comes into contact with human beings.     Continuation for an indefinite time of testing at the same rate as over the last few years would gradually increase the contamination of the atmosphere, untilin about 100 years time the average individual in this country would receive a dose&quot; of external radiation to the gonads of 0.026 r in 30 yearsof his life, an amount which represents only one per cent of that receivedfrom the natural background.     The effects of such a dose of externalradiation are insignificant.2.      Account must be taken, however, of the particular hazard fromradio-active strontium in the fall-out.    The maximum permissiblelevel of strontium 90 in the human skeleton, accepted by the Inter-national Commission on Radiological Protection, corresponds to1, 000 micromicrocuries per gramme of calcium.    But this is themaximum permissible level for adults in special occupations and it isnot suitable for application to the population as a whole or to childrenwith their greater sensitivity to radiations and greater expectation of life.    It is known that radiostrontium is more heavily concentrated inthe bones of young than of adult animals, and the few measurements on human bones indicate that at the present time those of children containabout ten times the concentration found in those of adults.    We consider,therefore, that the maximum allowable concentration of radiostrontiumin the bones of the general population, with its proportion of young children, should not be greater than 100 micromicrocuries of strontium90 per gramme of calcium.In this country, measurements on human bones of the radio-strontium content, derived from the nuclear explosions that have already occurred, show that the irradiation from this source is now reachingabout one thousandth of the maximum permissible occupational level;and calculation of the fall-out likely to come, if the present rate offiring continues, suggests that this level may be increased ten-foldin the course of several decades.    The present level would produce nodetectable increase in the incidence of ill-effects.    It is evident,however, that we are now accumulating radiostrontium at an appreciablerate and that a close watch will need to be  kept on this increase.3.      In the light of knowledge at present available, we should feelthat immediate consideration were required if the concentration inhuman bones showed signs of rising greatly beyond one hundredth of thatcorresponding to the maximum permissible occupational level.
1 9-AI 6.U4.      We are well aware of the inadequacy of our knowledge of thebiological effects of radio-active strontium and of the urgent necessity to obtain further information.    Nevertheless, recognising all the inadequacy of our present knowledge, we cannot ignore the possibility that, if the rate of firing increases and particularly if greater numbersof thermo-nuclear weapons are used, we coiiid, within the lifetime ofsome now living, be approaching levels at which ill-effects might beproduced in a small number of the population.Excerpt from ConclusionsFall-out from Test Explosions of Nuclear &quot;Weapons5.   (a)  The present and foreseeable hazards from external radiationdue to fall-out from the test explosions of nuclear weapons, fired at thepresent rate and in the present proportion of the different kinds, arenegligible.(b)  Account must be taken, however, of the internal radiationfrom the radio-active strontium which is beginning to accumulate inbone.    At its present level, no detectable increase in the incidence ofill-effects is to be expected.    Nevertheless, recognising all the inadequacy of our present knowledge, we cannot ignore the possibility that, if the rate of firing increases and particularly if greater numbersof thermo-nuclear weapons are used, we could, within the lifetime ofsome now living, be approaching levels at which ill-effects might beproduced in a small number of the population.
In the Statement on Defence, 1955, Her Majesty,s government announced their intention to manufacture thermo-nuclear weapons.    As Ihave previously stated, the holding of tests is an essential part of theprocess of providing ourselves with such weapons.    The U.S.A. and theU.S,S.R. have already held such tests and Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave therefore decided to carry out a limited number of nuclear testexplosions in the megaton range.    These will take place during the first half of 1957 in a remote part of the Pacific Ocean.     The explosions willtake place far from any inhabited islands and the tests will be so arranged as to avoid danger to persons or property.     The tests will be high airbursts which will not involve heavy fall-out.    All safety precautions willbe taken in the light of our own knowledge and of experience gained fromthe tests of other countries.     The main base of the aircraft of the RoyalAir Force taking part will be Christmas Island, and meteorologicalfacilities will be installed there.     The Governments of Australia andNew Zealand have agreed to make available to the task force various forms of aid and ancillary support in Australian and New Zealandterritory.In reaching this decision, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have given full weight to the anxiety that exists about the continuance of tests of nuclear weapons without control and without limitation.     They havedecided to ask the other Powers concerned to join in further discussions which will have the purpose of devising methods of ensuring that testexplosions are henceforward limited and under effective control.    Theywould themselves be willing to discuss this matter of limitation andcontrol on its own merits.ANNEX ii draft STATEMENT
