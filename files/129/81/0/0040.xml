(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P. (56) 140 COPY NO.12th June, 1956CABINETTRINIDAD OIL COMPANYNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate a report by officials of the Treasury,  Colonial Office and ministry of Fuel and Power.    I shall make my comments on this orallyat the Cabinet.H.M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.11th June, 1956.
SECRETTRINIDAD OIL COMPANY LIMITEDReport by officials the Trinidad Oil Company has had an offer from the Texas company to buy its entire issued stock.     Texas have offered  63.2 millions, whichis about twice the market value before the offer was made.2.      The purpose of this memorandum, which has been prepared by officials of the Treasury in consultation with the Colonial Office and ministry of Fuel and Power, is to give the factual background, and to analyse the economic and financial considerations involved, so far aspossible in the short time available.     The note does not, of course,purport to deal with the political considerations.3.      The main things the Trinidad Oil Company does are asfollows:-(a) TrinidadIt produces just over a million tons of oil a yearand refines another three million, most of which is supplied by an American Company from Venezuela.(b) United KingdomIt has a half share with an American Company,Caltex (U.K.) Ltd., in the Regent Oil Company, whichdistributes refined products in the United Kingdom.(c) CanadaIt refines, markets and, to a small extent, producesoil from an existing concession.Further details of the Company&apos;s activities and structure are given in the annex to this note.4.      It will be seen that in relation to free world crude oil production of707 million tons, the Company&apos;s present production of 1 million tons isvery small indeed;   so far as the United Kingdom is concerned theCompany has, through the Regent Oil Company, a half share in about pe r cent of the total trade in petroleum products and about 12 per cent of the trade in motor spirit.    At the present time it is in considerabledifficulty.    The United Kingdom distributing business has not beenprofitable and a greater part of the profits of the Trinidad operations hasto go to finance the building up of the Canadian enterprise.    TheCompany has stated publicly that it has not the resources necessary tomaintain its position.    It is estimated that about  30 millions is requiredover the next few years to finance the expansion necessary in the UnitedKingdom, Trinidad and Canada.     The Company is also considerablyhampered by the fact that its own crude oil production in Trinidad is
more expensive than Middle East production on which its rivals heavilyrely.    In spite of strenuous efforts, the Company has been unable to findeither the capital or a source of cheap crude oil.5.      There is no doubt that Her Majesty&apos;s Government, under theExchange Control Act, has powers to prevent this deal going through.The Government of Trinidad have been consulted about the legal position there.    If it is desired to sanction the proposal, this can be done under existing legislation with the Governor&apos;s consent.    If on the contrary itwere desired to withhold approval, the Trinidad Government have advisedagainst using any of their local powers.    Enquiries have shown that thepreliminary reaction of the Government of Trinidad is in favour of the project, provided that certain conditions (which they have made public)are satisfied.    Both the interests of Trinidad and those of the UnitedKingdom and the Sterling Area must be considered and this can most conveniently be done by taking first the consequences of refusing consentand secondly the consequences of giving it.Consequences of Refusal6.      V/e have been advised from Trinidad that, if Her Majestyrs Govern-ment withheld approval, feeling would be provoked on the lines that agreat chance of consolidating the future of the industry had been missed.The charge would be made that it was a typical effect of colonialism wherethe good of the Island received little consideration when in conflict withImperial interests.    Secondly, it would be held that an obligation woulddevolve on Her Majesty&apos;s Government to ensure that no serious consequences ensued for the Trinidad Oil Company.    In other words a refusal would carry with it the obligation to find from some other sourcethe increased capital which the Company required.7.      In the circumstances of a refusal of the offer, American capital would clearly be ruled out and the only sources would appear to be either the Exchequer or one of the British oil companies -i.e., Shell or british petroleum (B.P.),    Both on grounds of general policy and in view of present difficulties, it is not easy to see how the capital required could beprovided from the exchequer rtainly it could not be foundwithout serious damage to other more important projects.    Moreover, toprovide it would place a very heavy burden, not only on the Budget and united Kingdom resources, but also on the balance of payments,  since it would require considerable sterling expenditure in Trinidad and dollar expenditure in Canada. :0.      As regards the British oil companies, the operations in Trinidadwould not be particularly attractive to them;   the major difficulty would,however, arise over the United Kingdom operations of the Regent oil company.    In the United Kingdom market the Regent Oil Company isamong the chief competitors of Shell and B. P. who, in this field, operatejointly.    No doubt from their commercial point of view they might liketo eliminate this competitor;  but they could not do this by buying onlythe half share in the Regent Oil Company which is on offer;   the otherhalf belongs to Caltex, one of their chief rivals, and it would be mostembarrassing for either Shell or B. P. to run the Regent Oil Company inco-operation with Caltex - while Caltex itself might be in difficulty with united States Anti-Trust legislation.    Moreover, even if these difficulties were overcome, our action in assisting in the elimination ofthis element of competition would hardly be consistent with our policy
towards monopolies.    As regards E.P., there would be the addeddifficulty that it would appear that Her Majesty*s Government were using their legal powers to promote the commercial interests of a company inwhich it has the majority share holding.    Finally, even if the british companies did provide the funds, the United Kingdom economy wouldhave to bear the burden of finding the additional resources required,including the dollars for the Canadian expansion.Consequences of Acceptance9.      First the consequences for Trinidad.    One of the objects of the project is to enable the operations in Trinidad to be expanded and forexploration, particularly in the submarine areas, to be intensified.Provided that satisfactory assurances are obtained on this, considerableeconomic benefits, which the present Company cannot provide, would accrue to Trinidad.    At the same time, however, it would be necessaryfor the Government of Trinidad to have satisfactory assurances about theattitude of the new owners to labour and racial questions.    The generalreputation of the Texas Company in thi3 respect is good, and the Govern-ment of Trinidad has stated that Texas-controlled companies in Trinidadappear to subscribe to the Governments labour policy and to be willing toco-operate with the Trade Unions,    In any event it would clearly have to ba condition of consent that the Trinidad operations should be put in thehands of a company registered in Trinidad so that there would be a management on the spot familiar with conditions in the Colony and on whom the influence of the Government could be brought to bear.10.    In addition to the Trinidad Oil Company there are a number ofother smaller oil undertakings in the Colony, including a Shell undertaking and a number of American ones.    If this deal goes through, Americaninterest in the total operations will predominate and it seems likely thatthe smaller British undertakings might have to sell out to american interests, though Shell is likely to be able to continue.    The economic consequences of the further extension of American interest would not be different from those which arise in connection with this project;   the strategic aspect is governed by the smallness of the total output fromTrinidad in relation to world production.    Moreover, the Governor ofTrinidad has absolute powers to preempt all oil supplies in the event ofan emergency.11.     The probable Canadian reaction to acceptance of the deal must also be mentioned.    The Canadian Government is being consulted but itseems likely, given the general Canadian attitude to increasing UnitedStates investment there, that it would not be welcome to Canada that theCanadian enterprise should come in this way into United States ownership.The Canadian undertaking is, however, only one part of the deal, andthis aspect could hardly be the determining factor in the decision,-although it would be necessary to explain the reasons to the canadian government.12.     The consequences of agreement for the United Kingdom and the sterling Area are more complicated.    It would clearly have to be acondition of acceptance that the trade which the Company at presentcarries on in the United Kingdom, and the rest of the Sterling Area (etherthan Trinidad) should continue to be carried on by a company registered in the United Kingdom and operating under the arrangements which we already have with the American oil companies, including Caltex, for
the conduct of their trade in sterling.    On this basis we should obtain the oil supplies for ourselves and the Sterling Area in sterling;    against thatwe should have to provide dollars for the remittance of profits to the parent company.    This additional dollar cost would not only be small but would be more than counter-balanced by the benefits to our balanceof payments on capital account.    The burden of the Canadian investment would be lifted from our shoulders, while we should obtain a continuingUnited States investment in Trinidad and the United Kingdom.     Thus weshould get not only the immediate benefit of the addition of some$100 millions to the reserves, but also a continuing benefit to the balanceof payments.Alternative Possibilities13.    It might be thought possible to avoid some of the difficulties bysplitting up the deal - e.g. by agreeing only to the sale of the UnitedKingdom distribution business, and retaining the Trinidad and Canadianundertakings.    There seems little doubt that it is the marketing outletin the United Kingdom which is most attractive to the Texas Company.Nevertheless, their offer has been made for the whole of the undertaking of the Trinidad Oil Company and it is likely that they are also keenlyinterested in the prospect of expanding the Trinidad refinery operations,using crude oil from the Middle East.    It therefore seems likely thatthey would not be prepared to make an offer for the half share in theRegent Oil Company alone.    Moreover, the Trinidad operation could notfunction without marketing outlets, and v/ith the sale of the Regent oil company all of these would be in the hands of its rivals.     The problemof providing for the future of what was left of the Trinidad Oil company would therefore be much aggravated.General Considerations14.     Two broader considerations which should be mentioned:-(a) To refuse to allow this deal to go through would be contraryto the policy which has been followed, with considerablebenefit to the United Kingdom, towards United Statesinvestment both here and particularly in the CaribbeanColonies.     The United Kingdom is itself a major over-sea investor and in recent years United Kingdom interestsacquired a number of profitable undertakings in theWestern Hemisphere.     This must be a two-way business.(b) The United Kingdom depends for most of its raw materials,including oil, on oversea sources of supply and requires the willing co-operation of the countries where theresources are.    The effect on such countries of a refusal to agree to this sale might well be serious.15.     The preceding paragraphs show that, from the economic point ofview, which is all that this note is concerned with, there is a balance ofadvantage in favour of agreeing to the deal, provided the following conditions are satisfied:-
(a) the marketing operations in the United Kingdom and the restof the Sterling Area (other than Trinidad) are carried on by a company registered in the United Kingdom and operating in sterling under arrangements agreed with her Majesty&apos;s Government;(b) the production and refining operations in Trinidad are carried on by a company registered in Trinidad;(c) the Trinidad refinery is operated at full economic capacity and if possible expanded;(d) exploration in Trinidad is intensified;(e) existing oil resources in Trinidad are exploited on the basisof sound operating practice at the maximum economicrate;(f) industrial relations are maintained on the basis of existing and established practice;(g) there is fair treatment of existing personnel and greatlyincreased training of local men to take high position inthe Company;(h) there is no racial discrimination in any of the Company&apos;splant or camps and the rights of local persons arerespected.11th June, 1956
i s yStock1.      This consists of some 15, 738, 000   5s. stock units whose market price before the offer was announced, was approximately 40s.    Texashave offeredSOs. 3d., i. e.  63. 2 millions.Organisation and Structure2.      Trinidad Oil Company&apos;s main activities are as follows:-(a) TrinidadIt produces and refines about 1 million tons a year of itsown crude.    It also refines an additional 3 million tonsobtained partly from another Trinidad company, Apex(Trinidad) Oilfields, but mainly from the Creole PetroleumCorporation (Venezuela) - a United States concern owned bythe Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) and also from theTexas Company.    It also has a one-third interest with the shell and the D&apos;Arcy Exploration Company in developing andexploring marine oil areas off Trinidad.(b) canada the Company has an 89 per cent subsidiary in theP,egent Refining (Canada) Company which refines, markets and, to a very small extent (15, 000 tons a year) producescrude from the Company&apos;s concessions in Alberta.(c) United KingdomThe Company has a 50 per cent interest in the RegentOil Company which distributes products under the tradename of Regent and at present has 6 per cent of the total united Kingdom market and nearly 13 per cent of the UnitedKingdom market for motor spirit.     The other 50 per centis owned by Caltex (U. K. ) Limited, a wholly ownedsubsidiary of the California Texas Corporation which, in turn, is owned as to 50 per cent by the Texas Company andas to 50 per cent by the Standard Oil Company of California.The California Texas Company is a marketing organisationoperating in Europe and the Eastern Hemisphere.(d) CaribbeanThe Company has marketing subsidiaries in the carribbean but these are unimportant in relation to its total business.(e) TankersThe Company also has a subsidary, Regent PetroleumTankship Company, which owns 9 tankers.
1 hCrude oil production in Trinidad3.      The total production in Trinidad in 1955 was 3.5 million tons, ofwhich the Company produced just over 1 million tons and refined afurther three-quarters of a million tons.
