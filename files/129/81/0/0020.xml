SECRETC0P.(56) 12014th May, 1956FLOUR COMPOSITION:  REPORT OF THE COHEN PANELMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland, theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Ministerof HealthBackgroundThe Flour Order, 1953, now in force has proved unworkableand ineffective in practice.    In order to find the basis for a more effectiveOrder it was essential first to resolve the question of the relative merits of high extraction flour and of lower extraction flour to which certainnutrients had been added.     There was difference of view of this questionbetween the scientific and medical advisers of the Government on the onehand and the milling industry on the other.2. The Panel on Composition and Nutritive Value of Flour wasappointed by us in May, 1955 to resolve this difference of opinion.     Toensure that the Panel would be authoritative and independent the members were nominated at our request by the President of the Royal Society,Lord Adrian, O.M,    The PanePs terms of reference are attached.Recommendation of the Panel3. The Panel have now reached the unanimous conclusion that:-&quot;the available evidence does not reveal any ascertainabledifference between national flour as defined in the FlourOrder, 1953, and flours of extraction rate less thannational flour, to which vitamin Bl, nicotinic acid andiron have been restored in the amounts specified in the flour Order, 1953, which would significantly affect the health of the population in any foreseeable circumstances&quot;.Action by the government. At their meeting on 27th April the Home Affairs committee decided that,  subject to the approval of the Cabinet, the PanePs Report shouldbe published and that at the same time the Minister of Agriculture should announce that:-(i)    the Government accept the main conclusion of the Panelas a basis for action in present circumstances;COPY NO.it7CABINET
(ii)    regulations will be introduced under the Food andDrugs Acts providing inter alia for the presence inall flour of certain minimum levels of vitamin Bl,nicotinic acid and iron after the abolition of the bread subsidy on 29th September, 1956.Publication of evidence5. When the PanePs Report has been pifclished there may be pressure for publication of written evidence submitted to the Panel.     the panel invited witnesses to give both oral and written evidence and gave an assurance that the evidence would be regarded as confidential.    Onlywritten evidence, which by itself might give a misleading impression,could be published and by publishing this themselves the Government wouldbe liable to arouse fresh controversy.     The Home Affairs Committee have therefore taken the view that the Government itself should not publish theevidence but that the onus should lie on witnesses to publish if they so wish.6. As at present drafted the statement of Government policy onthe Report contains the following paragraph:-&quot;The question has been raised whether certain of the evidence placed before the Panel on composition and Nutritive Value of Flour should be published.The Government, after consultation with the Chairmanof the Panel, feel that they could not themselves under-take to publish evidence, part of which was given to the panel orally and all of which was given in confidence.Should any individual or organisation which gave evidencefeel it desirable to publish their ov/n written evidence,however, the Government would see no objection&quot;.The Lord President and the Lord Privy Seal are in favour ofthis paragraph remaining in the statement.    We feel that it is unnecessary and that the point could be better dealt with by a reference in the press notice to be issued by our three Departments on publication.recommendation. We recommend that:-(i)  the Report of the Cohen Panel should be published on 1 7th May;(ii)   the Minister of Agriculture should announce theGovernments policy in the terms of paragraph above;(iii)  no reference should be made in the statement to publication of evidence, but the point should be covered in the Press Notice.J.S.H.A.R.H.T.11th May, 1956.
TERMS OF REFERENCE&quot;In the light of the scientific and medical evidencenow available(l)  to determine the difference in composition and nutritive value between(a) National flour as defined in the flour Order, 1953;(b) flour of extraction rates less thanNational flour as defined in the flour Order, 1953, to which thethree token nutrients have been restored;(c) flour of extraction rates less thanNational flour as defined in the flour Order, 1953, to which thethree token nutrients have notbeen restored;and(2) to advisewhether any such differences aresignificant from the point of viewof the health of the population. &quot;
