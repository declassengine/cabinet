secret.P. (56) 1321st June, 1956NUCLEAR AND ALLIED RADIATIONSMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilOn 29th March last year, following a debate in the House of Common:on 22nd March, Sir Winston Churchill announced that the Government had invited the Medical Research Council to review the existing scientificinformation on the medical aspects of nuclear radiation, including thegenetic aspects, and to prepare a report which would be laid as a white paper (Hansard, 29th March, 1955, Col. 197).2.      The Council appointed a special Committee to prepare the report,under the Chairmanship of their Secretary, Sir Harold Himsworth.     Themembers of the Committee included many distinguished scientists, mostof them not in Government employment, and it would be difficult to imaginea more authoritative body for the purpose.3.      The report, entitled &quot;The Hazards to Man of Nuclear and AlliedRadiations&quot;, has now been completed, and a copy of the proof is attached.The Cabinet are being consulted separately, in CP. (56) 131, about certain important aspects of findings in the report.    The purpose of the present paper is to transmit the report as a whole to the Cabinet, and to inform them what I propose about publication.4.      I propose that the report should be published as a Command paper on Tuesday, 12th June - a date chosen to coincide approximately with theappearance of the report of a parallel enquiry which has been conducted inthe United States by the National Academy of Sciences (a body correspondingroughly to the Royal Society here).    It is important that this date, whichhas been agreed with the Americans, should be adhered to, so that theMedical Research Council report is not put at a disadvantage through all the initial publicity going to the American report.    Details of the conclusionsof the American report are expected very shortly.5.      A Committee of officials - the Atomic Energy (Official) Committee -are being asked to consider urgently the contents of the Council report but,for obvious reasons, I am circulating the report to my colleaguesimmediately the proof became available.    If the official Committee wishto give particular advice to the Cabinet, this will be circulated separatelyas soon as possible.6.      The report contains a summary in paragraphs 291-361 and theconclusions are set out in paragraph 362.    I would draw the Cabinefsparticular attention to the following conclusions in paragraph 362 (thefirst two of which are referred to in greater detail in C. P. (56) 131 andthe Annex thereto):-COPY NO.  cabinet
19 9JL rd ij4(a)This paragraph is re-assuring - as regards the possible effects of external radiation arising from test explosions of nuclear weapons.    This includes the possible genetic effectsabout which there has been public concern.4(b)This finding - about the internal effect (i. e. on the body)of radio-active strontium accumulating as a result of thefall-out from test explosions - is one of the most seriousconclusions in the report, and is likely to attract much attention.5We can expect much public interest in these conclusions,which imply that the effects, particularly the genetic effects,of current uses of radiation, X-rays, etc., in medical practice and for other purposes, may constitute a danger and should be reviewed.    In general, however, the scale of the geneticeffects of radiation is less than had been anticipated.7.      I propose to hold a Press conference with the Lobby correspondentson 11th or 12th June and to have an arranged Parliamentary Questionanswered on 12th June announcing publication of the report.Sir Harold Himsworth and Sir John Cockcroft should also, I think, have aconference with the scientific correspondents on 12th June.3.      The report is bound to receive very wide publicity, in view of theintense public interest that the subject has aroused.    I think there can beno doubt that Parliamentary time will have to be found for a debate on thereport within the next few weeks.    In view of this, I suggest that it shouldbe published without, for the moment, any statement of the governments views on it.9.      The Medical Research Council report and the American report willbe the first such documents to be made available to the United NationsScientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, which was set upby resolution of the General Assembly last November and held its firstmeeting in April.    Under the resolution, this Committee is to receive,collate, evaluate and publish information on radiation levels and on theeffects of radiation on man and his environment.10.    I invite my colleagues to agree:-(l)  that the report should be published on 12th June,with an arranged Parliamentary Question.    Ishould be glad of their views as to the desirable-ility of a simultaneous Government statement on the report.    My own view is given in para-graph 3 above.
(2)  that, if necessary, an undertaking can be given thatthe Government will find Parliamentary time for idebate on the report in the fairly near future.S.Privy Council Office, S. W. 1.31st May, 1956.

The Council accordingly appointed acommittee, under the chairmanship of Sir Harold Himsworth; andthis body has now reported.The report has been accepted by the Medical Research Council,and I have been authorised to transmit it to you with a view topresentation to Parliament. It is the wish of the Council that, in so doing, I should express their high appreciation of the care, thought and ability which all members of the Committee have devoted sofreely to their most difficult and important task.I am, Lord President,Your obedient Servant,Chairman,Medical Research Council.June, 1956.

1THE HAZARDS TO MAN OF NUCLEAR AND ALLIEDRADIATIONSA REPORT TO THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCILCHAPTER IINTRODUCTION1. In accordance with the undertaking of the Prime Minister given in theHouse of Commons on the 29th March, 1955, the Medical Research Council,in April of that year, appointed us members of a committee, under thechairmanship of Sir Harold Himsworth, to review the existing scientificevidence on the medical aspects of nuclear and allied radiation, and we haveunanimously signed this report.2. We held our first meeting on the 3rd May, 1955, and decided to carryout our enquiry for the most part through two panels, one of which undertook to consider the effects of radiation on the health of the individual, and theother the possible genetic consequences of radiation to the population as awhole as well as to the individual and his descendants. Sir Ernest RockCarling, Professor A. Haddow, Professor A. Bradford Hill, Dr. J. F. Loutit,Professor W. V. Mayneord, Dr. F. G. Spear, Professor Sir Lionel Whitbyand Professor B. W. Windeyer have served on the former panel, which has met nine times. Professor A. Bradford Hill, Professor K. Mather, ProfessorP. B. Medawar, Professor J. S. Mitchell, Professor L. S. Penrose, Sir EdwardSalisbury and Professor C. H. Waddington have served on the latter, whichhas met eleven times. In addition, Sir John Cockcroft and Professor J. R.Squire have served on the main committee. Both panels have worked underthe chairmanship of Sir Harold Himsworth and all papers have been circu-lated to every member of the committee. More than seventy specially preparedpapers have been considered, some of them drafted by specialists not servingon the committee, and we have drawn widely on the relevant publishedmaterial. Groups to consider special problems have been appointed as theneed arose. We have also taken into account relevant work carried out underthe auspices of the Medical Research Councils Committee on protection against Ionizing Radiations, and ithe recommendations and discussions ofthe International Commission on Radiological Protection. On the completionof the work of the panels, we have met together in full committee to consider our conclusions and to draw up this report. We have held four meetings ofthe whole committee during the period of our enquiry.3. Throughout the course of our work, and in the preparation of thisreport, we have been greatly helped by our two scientific secretaries, Dr.W. M. Court Brown and Dr. T. C. Carter, of the scientific staff of the medical research Council. We are also very much indebted to Dr. R. H. L. Cohenand to Dr. Joan Faulkner, of the Councu&quot;s headquarters staff, who have been responsible for co-ordinating the work of the panels and the various specialenquiries that we have initiated.4. The immediate occasion for the Governments request to the medical research Council to set up this Committee was the widespread public concern
about the long-term effects of nuclear weapon testing. This is only one aspect,however, of the much larger problem arising from the increasing use ofionizing radiations. It is already apparent that the future development of ourcivilisation is closely bound up with the exploitation of nuclear energy. Atpresent, the potential hazards from its possible military uses overshadow inmany people&apos;s minds the vast potentialities for good of this new source of power. The hazards to health are qualitatively the same, however, whetherthey arise from nuclear weapons or from the use of ionizing radiation forpeaceful purposes. The difference is one of degree and intensity only. As withother sources of energy that man has harnessed to his service, the use ofionizing radiation necessarily entails risk ; but the risk is controllable within limits that he can accept. It is the purpose of this report to indicate thenature of the risks and the extent to which they can be controlled.5. Our purpose has been to give as firm a guide as the evidence allowsio informed opinion in the country as a whole, and more especially to those with whom lies the responsibility for practical decisions of policy. This haslaid on us the duty of drawing more precise conclusions than we might wishto do on purely scientific grounds, and we feel bound to point out that inthe course of our enquiry we have become increasingly aware of the impossi-bility, in the present state of knowledge, of coming to final conclusions on many questions of importance in the subject under study.. Nevertheless,because of the many and urgent problems on which action cannot be delayed,we have felt it incumbent upon us to attempt to give guidance to the best ofour ability. It is inevitable that, with the advance of knowledge, many of theviews which we have expressed will come to require amendment, but we feel reasonably confident that the general picture which we have drawn is unlikely to be found grossly inaccurate in perspective or scope.6. We wish to remind those who read this report that human populationshave always been exposed to ionizing radiation, and that it is the scale andnot the nature of the hazard which is new. Moreover, our remarks in many respects can be applied only to large populations living under conditionssimilar to those prevailing in this country. A technically advanced com-munity, such as our own, is likely to be exposed to a greater risk from theindustrial and medical uses of atomic energy. These risks have to be weighed against the established benefits derived from the use of ionizing radiation in industry and medicine, and against the benefits likely to be conferred inthe future.7. We have thought it helpful to the general reader to follow this intro-duction with a brief account of radiation and its mode of action on livingcells (Chapter II). The types of radiation and the units in which they aremeasured are described, and the chapter concludes with an outline of the way in which radiation acts on living tissues.8. In Chapter III consideration is given to the effects of radiation on the health of the exposed individual. A brief review of the available sources ofinformation is followed by an account, first, of the clinical manifestationswhich may occur within a short time of exposure, and, secondly, of theeffects which may appear a considerable time, perhaps many years, after-wards. The chapter includes a discussion of the evidence from a detailed study of the relationship between radiation dose and the incidence ofleukaemia in patients suffering from a particular disease. This study was undertaken at our request by members of the Medical Research Councilsstaff, and we should like to thank Dr. W. M. Court Brown and Dr. R. Doll,who carried out the work, for the great help that they have given us. Thefull results of the enquiry are to be published separately and are summarised at Appendix B.
9. Chapter IV of the report opens with a short account of the biologicalprocesses controlling the hereditary constitution in human beings, and pro-ceeds to a description of the way in which radiation might affect the geneticstructure of human populations. An attempt is then made, in terms of the incidence of certain specific grossly harmful conditions, to assess the conse-quences for the individual and society of increasing: the rate of mutation, andto define the levels of dose which might be expected to bring about such anincrease.10. In Chapter V the contributions made to the present level of radiationby naturally occurring radioactivity and by the medical, industrial and otheruses of ionizing radiation are reviewed. Many new data have been obtained,and an investigation has bean initiated at our request, and is still in progress,to establish more precisely the contribution from various diagnostic andtherapeutic procedures (Appendix K). An assessment is then made ofthe results of contamination from the fallout from atomic and thermonucleartest-explosions, and the chapter concludes with a brief description of thenature of nuclear warfare.11. Chapter VI sets out our assessment of the hazards of ionizing radia-tion on the basis of the evidence put forward in the earlier chapters andproceeds to a discussion of the hazards from radiation in peace and war,including an assessment of the hazard from explosions of nuclear weapons.12. Chapter VII contains a summary of our report which is followed bya statement of our conclusions.13. The highly technical nature of this report has made it necessaryto devote some space in each chapter to a description of generally acceptedscientific theory in terms comprehensible to the general reader. No attempthas been made to prepare a bibliography for these parts of the report. Wherenew material has been drawn upon or controversial topics are discussed,the evidence has been set out in greater detail in appendices, to which lists of selected references to published work have been attached.14. It will be evident to any reader of this report that, at the presenttime, there are many large and serious gaps in our knowledge of the medical and biological effects of ionizing radiation. If the potentialities for good areto be exploited with confidence and safety, it is necessary that these gapsshould be filled. Much research on many broad, fronts will be required.Given the necessary facilities, there is no reason to doubt that the informa-tion can be obtained ; and we attach the greatest importance to the recom-mendations for future work that we have been invited to submit for theconsideration of the Medical Research Council.
CHAPTER IITHE NATURE OF RADIATION AND ITS ACTIONON LIVING CELLSIntroductionDiscovery of X-rays15. The transference of energy from sun to earth by radiant heat and light was already well recognised when in 1895 the discovery of X-raysrevealed something quite novel namely rays which had the power ofpenetrating normally opaque objects. The power of penetration varied inrelation to different tissues of the body, and this variation enabled shadowpictures of internal structures to be seen and so laid the foundation of thefirst great use of the new discovery. Almost by accident it came to be recog-nised in the next few years that part of the radiation was absorbed in thetissues, with the production of physico-chemical changes which could leadto biological damage.Discovery, of natural radioactivity16. The production of X-rays was soon followed by the discovery of natural radioactivity. It was found that compounds of certain heavy elements in the earth&apos;s crust, such as uranium and radium, spontaneously emitted rayswhich had similar properties to X-radiation, although they were of differentpenetrating power. Later, rays were identified which reached the earth fromouter space and these were named &quot; cosmic rays &quot;.Disintegration of radioactive elements17. The radiation emitted from radioactive elements is due to spontaneousdisintegration of their atoms, with the production of one or more types of radiation and of a new element lighter in weight than the original one. Aradioactive element, such as radium, may be regarded as a population ofatoms, each of which has a length of life ending in spontaneous break-upof the atomic nucleus with emission of radiation, partly in the form of astream of particles and partly as wave-propagated radiant energy. In thisway the amount of radium gradually diminishes. While the moment of dis-integration of any particular atom is unpredictable, the rate of decay of thepopulation of atoms as a whole follows a strictly constant rule. Thus, anygroup of radium atoms decays to half its original number in a period ofabout 1,600 years. This period, called the half life, varies widely for differentradioactive substances but for each it is constant and characteristic. Some-times the new element formed by atomic disintegration is itself unstable anda cascade of successive disintegrations occurs, each with the emission., of oneor more types of radiation, until finally a stable non-radioactive substanceis formed.Radioactive isotopes18. After much pioneer work, dating from Rutherford&apos;s experiments as early as 1919, it was found possible in the nineteen-thirties to turn manynormally stable elements into unstable versions of their original form, bytreating their nuclei with suitably energetic radiations, and so to produceartificial radioactive substances. At first it was only possible to make these
artificial radioactive substances under very special conditions and on verysmall scale. The expansion of nuclear research during the last war, however,led to the development of die nuclear reactor, by means of which it becamepossible to create radioactive substances in very large quantities either directly or as by-products of the fission* processes in the reactor itself. Both naturaland artificial radioactive substances are now commonly called radio-isotopes.Types o  Radiation and Units of Measurement19. Several different kinds of penetrating radiation are known, of whichthe common types are the following:alpha particles: These are the nuclei of helium atoms and are swiftlymoving particles of high energy, carrying a positive electric charge.They have little power of penetration, passing into soft tissues for only small fractions of a millimetre, and irradiation of the body from outsidewith alpha particles is consequently of little significance. They may,however, affect living tissues when they arise from radioactive materialsactually within the body, and, in sufficient quantity, they are thenbiologically very destructive. ftbeta particles: These are fast-moving energy-carrying particles (electrons)of very small mass with a negative charge. The amount of energy thatthey carry may vary considerably and their power of penetration will vary accordingly. In general, beta particles are more penetrating thanalpha particles and can traverse distances of up to about a centimetre insoft tissues. For this reason they are valuable therapeutically, and radio-active substances emitting beta radiations are used for the destructionof superficial tumours. For the same reason heavy doses from outside the body can damage the superficial tissues and, if beta-emitting substancesare ingested, destructive effects within the body may be produced.gamma rays: These are electro-magnetic radiations of high energyemitted by atomic nuclei. Like alpha and beta particles they areproduced in the process of natural or artificially induced atomic dis-integration. Gamma rays have great penetrating powers in comparisonwith alpha and beta particles and the more energetic gamma rays cantraverse the whole body, with relatively little absorption. As a result,almost the whole thickness of the body may be irradiated by gammaradiations and this is a deciding factor in producing the generalillnesses which may follow this type of irradiation. The properties ofgamma rays are essentially similar to those of X-radiations but ingeneral gamma-rays have an energy and penetrating power corresponding to the more penetrating X-rays produced at such extremely high voltagesas several million volts.X-rays : These are similar wave-propagated radiations, which are usuallyproduced artificially by electrical machines and which are widely usedboth diagnostically and therapeutically in medical radiology. Theyvary considerably in their penetrating power, depending on the electricalenergy used in their production. The biological effect of X-rays are brought about by high-energy electrons, which are liberated in the tissuesduring the passage of the rays, so that the biological action of X-raysand beta particles is essentially the same.neutrons: These are normal constituents of atomic nuclei but may beliberated with considerable energy. They carry no electric charge and*Fission: The splitting of the nucleus of a heavy atom into two roughly equal parts withthe release of a large amount of energy.
are therefore not repelled by the charged nuclei of atoms, but enterinto them to build up unstable structures which often disintegrate withthe production of artificial radioactivity. Fast neutrons act on tissueschiefly by collision with the hydrogen of the water and of the othercompounds which they contain, the resulting &apos; recoil hydrogen nuclei&apos;somewhat resembling alpha particles in their action. The initially fastneutrons are gradually slowed down in the tissues and may then bringabout biological effects by interaction particularly with nitrogen. Theymay also be captured by hydrogen, thereby releasing energetic gammarays.Ionization20. These several types of radiation vary not only in their powers ofpenetration but also in relation to the number of electrically charged atomsand molecules, called ions, that they leave in their tracks as they pass through tissues. For this reason they are collectively known as ionizingradiations. It Is the production of electrically charged particles, or ions,which is mainly responsible for initiating the physico-chemical changes in living tissue that lead ultimately to the production of overt radiationdamage. The efficiency of a given dose of radiations in producing biologicaleffects can be related to the numbers of ions produced per unit lengthof the particles&apos; track.Intensity of dose and length of exposure21. The biological effects of radiation are closely related to the dose, orquantity, of radiation received. An analogy can be drawn with the effects of ultra-violet light on the skin in producing sunburn. It is well known thatthese effects depend on two main factors, the brightness of the sunshineand the length of the exposure to it. Similarly, the effects of radiationssuch as gamma rays, X-rays or beta rays are determined by the sametwo factors, the intensity of the radiation and the period of exposure.Radiation may be regarded as consisting of small units of energy called&apos; quanta&apos;, and the intensity of the beam of a given kind of X- or gammarays is simply a measure of how many such quanta are striking a particular area in a given time. The dose of radiation might therefore be described as the energy which is absorbed in the small mass of tissue upon whichthe radiation impinges. Living tissues are, however, not inert. After sometypes of damage by radiation, repair processes take place and the rate atwhich the dose of radiation is given becomes an important factor in determining the observed biological effect. Thus, if a dose of radiation isspread out over a very long time, for example many years, the responsemay be very much smaller than or even quite different from that whichwould occur if the same amount of radiation were given in a very short time. On the other hand, with some well known forms of biological damageproduced by ionizing radiations, recovery does not occur. The production ofgene mutation is perhaps the most important example of this latter type of change.Measurement of dose : the roentgen22. The difficulty of making satisfactory measurements of the dose of radiation has been overcome by making use of the changes of electricalconductivity which are brought about in air when ionizing radiations pass through it. This particular method of measurement is used, no only because it is technically convenient but also because the atomic composition ofair or water is in this respect essentially similar to that of the body, the
absorption of X-rays taking account only of the kind of atoms presentand not of their particular chemical combinations. The unit of dose whichhas hitherto been adopted internationally is called the roentgen,* whichis abbreviated to the letter &apos; r&apos;; for very small quantities of radiationthe milliroentgen (0-001 r) is often used as the unit. The intensity of radiationto which we are ordinarily exposed from our natural surroundings is about01 r per year.Measurement of radioactivity the curie23. It has been seen that the biological effects of radiation depend uponthe amount of energy which is absorbed in the tissues. At each radioactivedisintegration, an atom emits a certain amount of energy in the form of high-speed particles and gamma rays. The total irate at which the tissuesare irradiated therefore depends on how many atoms disintegrate per second.In considering the effects of radioactive materials actually within the tissues,use is accordingly made of units of radioactivity which depend on thenumber of atomic disintegrations per second. Based originally upon therate of disintegration of radium, the unit of radioactivity is called trie curieand represents the amount of an element in which 3-7 x 1010 disintegrationsoccur per second. This is too large an amount of radioactivity for mostbiological work and it is customary to measure the amounts of radioactivityin the body in microcuries (millionths of a curie). For some radioactivematerials the maximum amounts which can be allowed in the body are ofthe order of only 1 microcurie or less ; but even this very small amount ofmaterial corresponds to many thousands of atomic disintegrations persecond.Relative biological efficiency24. The destructiveness of the different types of radiation can also be ex-pressed in relation to that of an equivalent amount, in terms of energy,of gamma rays. This measure is known as the relative biological efficiency(r.ib.e.) and varies between different tissues.Action on Living Tissues25. The basis of the biological action of ionizing radiation is not fully understood. The consensus of opinion is that radiation acts primarily uponthe cell and its constituents, and upon the complex chemical processesoccurring in these, rather than upon the fluids in which the cell is bathed.It is thought that the processes associated with the formation of ions duringthe passage of radiation lead to changes in some of the highly organisedmolecular systems within the cell. These changes are probably brought, about by highly reactive chemical intermediates liberated within the cell subsequent to the physical process of ionization.Effect of radiation on organisms, tissues and cells26. All living tissue is killed if exposed to large enough doses of radia-tion. Different types of organisms, tissues and cells, however, vary greatly in the amount of radiation which they can withstand. Among mammals thedose of X-rays to the whole body which will kill 50 per cent of an animalpopulation varies from 200 to 1000 r depending on the species ; for man itis thought to be between 400 and 500 r. There is also a wide variation insensitivity between different animal tissues. For instance, in man the mostsensitive tissues include the lymphatic glands, the epithelium of the small* The roentgen shall be the quantity of X or gamma radiation such that the associatedcorpuscular emission per 0.001293 gramme of air produces, in air, ions carrying 1 electrostaticunit of quantity of electricity of either sign.
bowel, and the precursors of the blood cells which arc situated in the bonemarrow, whereas adult nerve and muscle tissue are comparatively insensi-tive. Variations in sensitivity also occur at different stages in the life cycleof a cell; for example, cells about to divide are often more sensitive thanthose in the resting state.Repair processes27. At dose levels below those which damage tissue irretrievably, thesituation is modified by processes of repair ; but a distinction must be drawn between true recovery in which the damaged cells return to normal form andfunction and the replacement of injured cells by those coming from outsidethe field of radiation. The latter is the more conspicuous form of repair afterheavy radiation damage in the higher animals and leads to the originaltissue being replaced by simpler unspecialised material or scar tissue. Repairprocesses within the individual cell are little understood and still largely amatter of speculation, but they must play an important part after low doses.
-   1CHAPTER IIIMM h      k.THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION ON THE HEALTH OF THEINDIVIDUALIntroduction28. Experience of the effects of ionizing radiations has been accumulatingwith increasing rapidity since the benefits which they may produce inthe treatment of malignant disease first began to be appreciated. this experience has been limited, in the main, to the effects produced by the rela-tively large doses which it is often necessary to give to the area of the bodyunder treatment. More recently, knowledge of the effects of very large dosesto the whole body has been obtained as a result of the atomic bombexplosions in Japan. In this chapter it will be necessary to draw heavily onthe information from these two sources in considering both the acute andthe long-term effects of exposure to radiation, but the reader must bearin mind that such information is only indirectly relevant to the circumstancesof ordinary civilian life, since doses of this magnitude would only beconceivable in the immediate vicinity of an accident in a nuclear reactor.29. There is much less information about the possible effects of chronicexposure to very low doses of radiation, such as those to which specialgroups of workers may be exposed in the course of their occupations. Ata time like the present, when nuclear energy is being intensively developed for civil use, the importance of obtaining such information cannot be exaggerated. The investigation which we have sponsored on leukaemia was undertaken in an attempt to obtain information on the relationship betweenthe size of the dose of radiation and the incidence of the disease amongpatients with ankylosing spondytitis, so that conclusions might be drawnabout the effects of lower doses. The investigation must be regarded, however,as the first step only towards this goal.Sources of Information30. Information about the effects of radiation on man has been derivedfrom four main sources : radiotherapeutic experience; occupationalexperience, including that from accidents; experience from atomic bombexplosions ; and animal studies.31. Radiotherapy experience. Both X-rays and the gamma rays of radiumhave been used for many years in the treatment of disease, mainly in thetreatment of cancer. Observation of patients receiving radiotherapy has yieldedinformation on the general effects of radiation and on the effects produced in different tissues ; and the therapeutic use of radioactive isotopes has provided data on the effects of radioactivity within the body.32. Occupational experience. Information on the occupational hazards of radiation has been obtained from studies of three groups of workers: medicalradiological workers, painters of luminous dials for watches and clocks, and miners working radioactive ores in the Schneeberg. mines in Saxony andin Joachimsthal. The experience of these three groups serves to illustrate threedifferent forms of radiation hazard. The radiological workers were exposedmainly to external irradiation by X- and gamma-rays, and some developed
skin damage leading to skin cancer, or bone-marrow damage leading tosevere diseases of the blood. The luminous-dial painters ingested paintcontaining the naturally-occurring radioactive elements radium, mesothoriumand radiothorium, which are retained within the skeleton, and some developedbone tumours. The miners of Joachimsthal and Schneeberg worked in an atmosphere containing high concentrations of the radioactive gas radon, andmany developed lung cancer. The study of these three different hazards hascontributed greatly to our knowledge of the harmful effects of radiation,and has provided data for the formulation of safety standards.33. Atomic bomb experience. The atomic bomb explosions overHiroshima and Nagasaki brought widespread destruction to these cities. Blastand fire caused most of the casualties, but about 15 to 20 per cent were caused by the gamma and neutron radiations emitted during the explosions.In 1946 the United States established in Japan the Atomic Bomb CasualtyCommission, which has studied the immediate and the long-term effects of radiation from the bombs on the populations of both cities ; their findingshave been of great value in expanding knowledge on this subject.34. Analogous effects produced in animals. The discovery that X-rayscould produce changes in human tissues led investigators to study the effects of radiation on animals. As a result, it was established that radiation pro-duces effects in animals similar to those observed in man and it thusbecame possible to make an experimental approach to the problem of radiation hazards. The knowledge thus gained has been drawn on freely inthis report.Factors affecting the Severity of Radiation Injury35. The harmful effects of radiation can be divided into those developingwithin a few weeks of exposure and those developing some considerable time,perhaps many years, afterwards. Illnesses which develop within a few weeksare sudden in onset and run an acute course, whereas those occurring someyears after exposure develop insidiously.36. The severity of radiation injury in any particular instance is deter-mined by the interplay of several factors: the type and dose of radiationreceived, the duration of the period of exposure, the extent and part of the body which has been irradiated, and also the age of the person exposed.The dose of radiation received37. If the dose of radiation is a large one and is received by the whole body in the space of a few minutes, a severe and possibly fatal illness islikely to develop within a few hours, and certainly within a few weeks, ofexposure. Some of those who survive this early illness may die several years later from one of the delayed effects of radiation, such as anaemia orleukaemia. In contrast, exposure of the whole body to smaller doses of radiation, over a period of months or years, will not cause the early illness,but there may still be a slightly increased risk of death from the delayedeffects in later years.The extent of the body irradiated38. On the other hand if only a fraction of the whole body is irradiated,as in radiotherapy, immediate general effects are rare, although some patientsmay develop a mild form of the early illness, known as radiation sickness.It is often necessary to give a large dose locally and there may be localreaction in the irradiated area with temporary reddening of the skin orblistering similar to that which occurs in sunburn. Delayed local effects
that may occur in these patients are scarring, less commonly necrosis andrarely the later development of cancer in the irradiated tissues. It is nowapparent that there may be delayed general effects, a small proportion in later years developing anaemia or leukaemia. -The part of the body irradiated39. Experience has shown that there is a difference in the general effects of radiation according to the part of the body which is irradiated. Evenquite a large dose of radiation given to a portion of a limb will usuallyproduce no general ill effects whereas a similar dose directed to an equallylarge volume of tissue in the upper abdomen, for example, may producesevere immediate illness.The type of radiation40. The severity of effect produced by radiation may also depend to someextent upon the type of radiation concerned, since radiations differ in their powers of penetration and in their destructive effects. For example, fastneutrons are about ten times more potent that X- or gamma-rays in causingcataract in the lens of the eye, although these three forms of radiation differvery little in their capacity to cause the early acute form of illness.The age of the individual exposed41. It has long been known to radiotherapists that young children are more likely than adults to develop reactions after irradiation. further evidence on this point comes from a recent report on the inhabitants of the marshall Islands, who were exposed to radioactive fall-out after the thermo-nuclear test explosion in that area of the Pacific Ocean in the spring of1954. A consistently greater fall in the number of white corpuscles in the blood occurred among children than among adults, and a similar age-difference in response was noted also in regard to loss of hair.The frequency of radiation effects42. Reasonably good estimates have been made of the numbers likely todevelop the acute illness under varying conditions of whole-body irradiation.Thus, every member of a population receiving a single whole-body doseof 500 r of gamma-rays would become ill shortly afterwards; if the dosewere 150 r, only about half would do so; and, if it were of the order of50 r, sickness would be extremely rare. It is much more difficult to assess the proportion likely to suffer from the delayed effects ; all that can be saidwith certainty is that it would be small.The Early effects of Exposure to Radiation43. The following description of the effects of a single heavy dose ofgamma rays to the whole body is based on observation of the bomb-victimsin Nagasaki and Hiroshima. It must be repeated that, in peacetime, exposureat this level could result only from an accident which would rarely, if ever,occur and that, even then, only those in the immediate vicinity of the disasterwould be affected.Effects of heavy dosage44. The first effects of exposure of the whole body to a heavy dose ofgamma rays of the order of 500 r, is a sensation of nausea developingsuddenly and soon followed by vomiting and sometimes by diarrhoea. Insome people, these symptoms develop within half an hour of exposure ;in others, they may not appear for several hours. Usually, they disappearafter two to three days. In a small proportion of cases, however, the symptoms
persist; vomiting and diarrhoea increase in intensity; exhaustion, fever, and perhaps delirium follow ; and death may occur a week or so after exposure.45. Those who recover from the phase of sickness and diarrhoea may feelfairly well, although examination of the blood will reveal a fall in thenumber of white cells. Between the second and fourth weeks, however, anew series of ailments, preceded by gradually increasing malaise, will appear in some of those exposed. The first sign of these developments is likely tobe partial or complete loss of hair. Then, from about the third week onwards,small haemorrhages will be noticed in the skin and in the mucous membranesof the mouth, which will be associated with a tendency to bruise easily andto bleed from the gums. At the same time, ulcerations will develop in the mouth and throat, and similar ulceration occurring in the bowels will cause a renewal of the diarrhoea. Soon, the patient will be gravely ill, with com-plete loss of appetite, loss of weight, and sustained high fever. Feeding bymouth will become impossible, and healing wounds will break down and become infected.46. At this stage, the number of red cells in the blood is below normal,and this anaemia will increase progressively until the fourth or fifth weekafter exposure. The fall in the number of white blood cells, noted duringthe first two days after exposure, will have progressed during the interveningsymptomless period, and will by now be reaching its full extent. The changesin the blood-count seriously impair the ability to combat infection, andevidence from Nagasaki and Hiroshima shows that infections of all kindswere rife among the victims of the bomb. Many of the affected die at thisstage and, in those who survive, recovery may be slow and convalescenceprolonged ; even when recovery appears to be established, death may occursuddenly from an infection which in a healthy person would have onlytrivial results.Effects of lighter dosage41. The radiation effects described above are the most severe which canfollow a single whole-body dose of 500 r of gamma rays and still allowsome hope of survival; but at least half of a population so exposed woulddie. With smaller doses, fewer people would develop symptoms and theillness would become correspondingly less severe ; thus, with&apos; a dose of 100 r,not more than about 15 per cent of the exposed population would beaffected, the illness would be comparatively mild, and very few, if any,would die.Effects of exposure to &apos; fall-out&apos; in the vicinity of an explosion, 48. The radiations considered above have been those occurring within oneminute of the detonation of a nuclear weapon. These radiations have been called the prompt radiations to distinguish them from those emitted by theradioactive dust, or fall-out, which settles over a wide area in the vicinity of an explosion. The fall-out may itself be active enough to cause radiationillness of a type similar to that described above and, in addition, it maycontaminate and damage the skin with which it comes in contact.49. Following the firing of a thermonuclear weapon in the region ofthe Marshall Islands, the fall-out on one island was so heavy that it wascompared to snow, and the inhabitants received an estimated average whole-body dose of 175 r. This fall-out did not cause any deaths, but it did produce a mild illness with early sickness and diarrhoea, a fall in the number of cellsin the blood, loss of hair, and some ulceration of the skin contaminated byradioactive material. The skin lesions, caused largely by the higher local
1dose of beta-radiation emitted by the fall-out, appeared about two weeks after exposure on those parts of the body which had not been protected byclothing, and took the form of spotted areas of increased pigmentation, from most of which the skin peeled off as if it had been sunburnt. In about 20 percent of cases, deeper ulceration of the skin occurred but all wounds healedsatisfactorily.Relationship between dose and incidence of effects50. For the purposes of assessing risk and defining standards of safety, it isnecessary to know the nature of the relationship between the dose of radiationand the effect induced. This relationship may be a simple linear one in whichthe incidence of the particular disease increases strictly in proportion to thedose received, or it may be a curvilinear one in which, with each successiveand equal increment in dose, the incidence increases not by an equal but bya progressively greater amount. All the evidence suggests that the relation between dosage and radiation effects occurring within a few weeks of exposureis of the latter type, and that the curve shows a &apos; threshold&apos; level, implying that a certain quantity of radiation must be exceeded before these particulareffects are produced.The Delayed Effects of Exposure to Radiation51. Delayed effects of radiation which have been observed locally intissues heavily irradiated are atrophy and fibrosis of the skin and underlyingsoft tissues and sudden breakdown or necrosis of tissues such as bone andcartilage. In rare instances cancer has subsequently developed in the damagedtissues. Cataract has occurred if the lens of the eye has been irradiated. Thedelayed general effects of radiation, which are known, are the developmentof severe anaemias and leukaemia and, in addition, evidence is beginning to accumulate from observations made on animals that irradiation may causesome shortening of the normal life-span. In our report we have dealt inconsiderable detail with leukaemia, because experience in Japan following the atomic bomb explosions in 1945, and the results of our own investigationon the incidence of leukaemia among irradiated patients, have provided more precise information on the effects of different levels of exposure than is available for any other of the delayed effects.52. The knowledge that long-term effects may be produced by radiationis in itself an insufficient basis for assessing the risk that any of them will develop as a result of a particular dose. For this purpose, it is necessary toestimate, from national mortality statistics, the incidence of the condition inthe absence of exposure to radiation beyond that from the normal back-ground, and then to compare this figure with the incidence of the samecondition in a population that has been exposed to radiation. If an increase is demonstrated, the frequency with which the condition develops at different levels of radiation dose must be determined, and the relationship betweenthe dose and incidence of the disease must be evaluated. Only then is it possibleto assess the hazards, if any, associated with the different uses of radiation.induction of leukaemia53. Leukaemia is a disease in which uncontrolled over-production of thewhite blood-cells occurs. It is at present invariably fatal, although someforms may run a protracted course over many years. Several kinds ofleukaemia are described according to the type of cell mainly affected.Usually, there is an increase in the number of the affected cells in the blood,associated with the appearance of immature forms of the cell in question.In some cases, however, the numbers in the blood may fall below normal32066 A 6
through failure to liberate the cells from their site of formation in the bonemarrow ; the disease is then known as aleukaemic leukaemia.54. In many countries the death rates from leukaemia have shown a steadyrise in recent years. In 1920 the crude annual death rate from this condition for both sexes in England and Wales, for example, was 11 per millionpersons ; in 1954 it was 49 per million. Some of this rise has undoubtedly been due to an improvement in diagnosis but it seems probable that this isnot the whole explanation and that, for. a reason as yet unknown, there hasbeen a real increase in the national death rate from leukaemia.55. It is known that leukaemia may be induced in animals as a result ofexposure to radiation. Case reports have appeared from time to time of patients who have developed leukaemia after exposure to radiation for thetreatment of various diseases, and there have also been a number of reportsof radiologists dying from leukaemia. Such isolated reports do not of them-selves prove that the relationship is one of cause and effect, but the matter has now been put beyond doubt by a series of recent observations on the incidence of leukaemia under conditions in which an estimate could be madeof the degree of exposure to radiation.Leukaemia following a single exposure : atomic bomb explosions56. The most recent information, for which we have to thank the UnitedStates National Research Council, covers all cases of leukaemia recordedby the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission in Nagasaki and Hiroshimabetween January, 1947, and August, 1955. Vital statistics allow an estimateto be made of the number of cases of leukaemia that would have been expected to occur over a similar period in a Japanese population not exposed to radiation from the bombs but otherwise comparable to the survivingpopulations of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Calculations have been made forthe combined totals of the survivors of the explosions in both cities(Appendix A).57. During the eight years from 1947 to 1954, about 25 deaths fromleukaemia would have been expected in an unexposed Japanese populationof the same size and having the same age and sex distribution as the combined populations of survivors from both cities. Over the same period,however, 93 proven and 14 suspected cases have been recorded among those present at the time of the explosion and still resident in one or other cityat the time of diagnosis. The difference between the expected and theobserved number of cases is so great that it is most unlikely to be due tochance.58. The difference between the numbers expected and those observedbecomes even greater, if the most heavily irradiated survivors are considered separately. Only for Hiroshima are adequate details available of the distancesfrom the centre of the explosion at which the individual survivors had beenexposed. In the absence of radiation, it is unlikely that even one case wouldhave occurred among those survivors who were less than 1,000 metres distant,yet 16 cases have been found. Further, there is a much higher incidenceamong those who developed the early acute illness than among those whohad, at the most, only mild symptoms.59. An examination of the incidence of leukaemia in relation to the distance from the explosion, has been made for the survivors in Hiroshima,where the concentric distribution of the radiation was not affected to thesame degree as in Nagasaki by the irregular distribution of the radio-activefall-out. The dose from the prompt radiation decreases as the distance from the explosion increases. In survivors who were 2,000 metres distant
or more, the incidence during the period January, 1947, to August, 1955,was about 2 cases in every 10,000 persons. Among those between 1,500 and2,000 metres distant, the incidence was about 3 to 4 cases per 10,000 persons,and for those at the shorter distances of between 1,000 and 1,500 metres andunder 1,000 metres it was respectively about 28 and 128.60. To make an accurate estimate of the relationship between the dose of radiation and the incidence of the disease, one would have to substitute dosesexpressed in roentgen units for the distances from the centre of the explosion.It has not been possible to obtain reliable estimates of these doses, whichshould include not only the contribution from the gamma rays but alsothat from the neutrons emitted by the explosion and that from the radioactivefall-out. Tentative estimates of the gamma-ray dose received by peoplestanding in the open can be made from the information published by theUnited States authorities in &apos; The Effects of Atomic Weapons&apos; in 1950. these estimates suggest that the dose at under 1,000 metres would not be less thanl,400r, and at 1,250 metres about 350r. At 1,750 metres it would be about50r, and at 2,000 metres about 8r. As a dose of l,400r or more would killeveryone exposed to it, survivors who were within 1,000 metres of the explosion must have been heavily protected. An unknown proportion of the survivors at all the other distances must also have been protected to someextent because they were either indoors or, if outside, shielded by buildings.For this reason, it is not possible to indicate with any great confidence theaverage levels of dose received by survivors at different distances from thebomb and, in view of the uncertainty about the actual doses received by theexposed population, one cannot infer with certainty whether the relationship between dose and the incidence of leukaemia is a curvilinear or a linear one.61. For the Japanese cases which occurred up to the end of 1954, theaverage length of the period between exposure to the bomb and the firstappearance of symptoms was about 6 years. It is clearly important to deter-mine whether there has been any tendency for cases to occur less frequentlyin subsequent years. The morbidity rate has therefore been examined yearby year in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and it has been found that therecorded incidence has remained approximately constant in Hiroshima inthe period 1948 to 1954, and in Nagasaki in the period 1950 to 1954(Appendix A). This finding suggests that there is no sharply-defined peak year of occurrence, but that with this type of exposure the incidence of leukaemiarises, after a variable latent period, and then remains approximately constantup to at least the ninth year.Leukaemia following repeated exposures : radiotherapy62. Before 1955, there had been reports of leukaemia developing in twopatients given X-ray treatment for ankylosing spondylitis. In 1955, two further publications directed attention to this possibility, and a third reported the occurrence of leukaemia in young children who had been given X-raytreatment to the chest in infancy for suspected enlargement of the thymusgland. In an attempt to obtain further evidence on the occurrence of leukaemiaas a delayed effect of radiation, and in particular on the relationship betweenthe dose received and the incidence of the disease, we have sponsored a survey of patients treated for ankylosing spondylitis with irradiation.63. Ankylosing spondylitis is a disease which affects chiefly the joints ofthe spine, and to a lesser extent other joints, particularly those of the pelvisand the shoulders. It usually starts in early adult life and is about six timesmore frequent in men than in women. It causes severe pain and reducedmobility and, unless treatment is given, the affected joints may gradually lose their freedom of movement and the back become progressively stiff er,--In32066 A 7
severe cases all spinal movement is lost, chest expansion is greatly diminished,and the movements of other major joints restricted. The popular description,&quot; poker back &quot;, is a very apt one.64. Some patients with this condition are benefited by X-ray treatment,which is given to relieve pain and increase mobility and which may perma-nently halt the progress of the disease. As treatment usually takes the formof irradiation of the whole spine in one course of radiotherapy, it involvesexposing a large section of the body directly to the X-rays. In some patientsone course of treatment does not suffice, and further courses have to be given,either to the spine or to the major joints, or to both. Indeed, this group of patients was chosen for our investigation because the treatment is so extensivethat it more nearly approaches whole-body irradiation than that given for anyother non-malignant condition.65, An analysis has been made of the hospital records of between 13,000and 14,000 patients, all of whom had been treated with X-rays at some time during the twenty-year period 1935 to 1954. Thirty-seven of these patientsdeveloped leukaemia, an incidence of only about one-third of one per cent;yet calculations based on the national death rates over the same periodshow that even this low incidence is about ten times greater than wouldhave been expected in the absence of irradiation. The possibility of such a difference being due to chance is so remote that we shall ignore it.66. Caution is necessary, however, in interpreting this finding. It is notpossible to conclude immediately that the increased number of deaths fromleukaemia is related to the X-ray treatment, in the way that the increaseddeath rates among previously healthy people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki canbe attributed to exposure to the radiations from the bombs. The possibilityhas to be considered that death from leukaemia would, even in the absenceof treatment by irradiation, be a more frequent occurrence among sufferersfrom ankylosing spondylitis than among the normal population, or alterna-tively that ankylosing spondylitis in some way increases a patient&apos;ssusceptibility to irradiation.67. By courtesy of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, wehave been able to examine the records of a group of about .400 malepatients with ankylosing spondylitis who had never at any time been treated with X-rays. The fact that no increased incidence of leukaemia was foundin this group suggests that ankylosing spondylitis does not of itself predisposea patient to the development of leukaemia. To confirm this point, it wouldbe necessary to examine the records of a much larger group of unirradiatedpatients; X-ray treatment is, however, so widely used for ankylosing spondy-litis that it may be difficult to do this.68. Clear evidence was, however, found in our main investigation for theexistence of a relationship between the dose of radiation and the incidence of leukaemia. The dose was estimated in two different ways, firstly bycalculating the total amount of energy absorbed in the whole body, and secondly by calculating the dose of radiation received in certain parts of thebone marrow. The first method demonstrated a curvilinear relationship between the incidence of leukaemia and the radiation dose, whereas thesecond method resulted in a linear relationship. Fortunately, over the range of doses likely to be met with in ordinary civil conditions, the differencebetween the two results is negligible. The theoretical implications of the two possible relationships are, however, very different and important and point the way to considerable future research. The data upon which the findingsarebased are summarised in Appendix.B.;;... ......
1induction  of cancers72. The evidence for the induction of cancers by radiation consists&apos; chieflyof reports of the occurrence of cases under circumstances which make it reasonable to suppose that some at least were radiation-induced, and of the&apos;apparently increased frequency of a particular type of cancer, itself rare inthe normal population, in persons exposed to heavy doses of radiation. Mostof the information comes from the case records of patients treated withradiotherapy and from those of workers in certain special occupations who in the past received very heavy doses of radiation in the course of their work. It is noteworthy that tumours following radiotherapy tend to develop in tissue already severely damaged by radiation, and that, compared withleukaemia, a much longer period up to 20 years or more-usually elaipsesbetween the first exposure to radiation and the clinical appearance of theisdise&amp;seT -x itfll ni, will &apos;i&amp; &amp;ph$% gaol -:o&quot;: 3d c: mm ,&apos;i&apos;bod o;*;32066 A 869. The average length of time between the first exposure to X-rays andthe diagnosis of leukaemia was about six years. This period cannot be directly compared with that observed in the Japanese cases, as many of the patients had had several courses of radiation before leukaemia wasdiagnosed, and it is not known which particular course was the effective oneor whether all the courses may not, to some degree, have affected thedevelopment of the disease. Nevertheless, it may be concluded from bothseries of cases that the latent period for radiation-induced leukaemia isshorter than for radiation-induced cancers.Leukaemia following chronic exposure70. We have no precise knowledge of the incidence of leukaemia under conditions of chronic exposure. It has been reported that, relative to thenumbers at risk, there are about nine times as many deaths from leukaemiaamong American radiologists as among other American physicians. this figure is based on a study of the obituary notices published in the Journalof the American Medical Association from 1929 to 1948, in which boththe professional occupation and the cause of death are usually reported. in about a quarter of the notices, however, the cause of death was not reported and thus a bias may have been introduced into the results of the study. a review of all the published papers on this subject shows that there maywell be an increased death rate from leukaemia among American physiciansas a whole, compared with the general population, and in particular amongAmerican radiologists, but it is not possible to estimate the extent of theincrease with any certainty.General conclusions on the induction of leukaemia71. The results of the investigations carried out by the Atomic BombCasualty Commission in Japan, and of our own study of the occurrence of leukaemia in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, leave no doubt thationizing radiations can induce leukaemia in man, and that the average latentperiod between exposure and the development of the disease is only a fewyears. In neither of these situations were the conditions of exposure similarto those of persons engaged in work associated with a possible radiationhazard. Those exposed occupational^ tend to receive radiation in smalldoses over long periods, and it is not yet known whether the dose-responserelationship based on short periods of heavy exposure is directly applicableto such conditions.
Cancer of the lung73. The mines of Sehneeberg and Joachimsthal are rich in a variety ofores and, since the latter part of the last century, pitchblende, an orecontaining radium and other radioaotive elements, has been extensivelyworked there. It had long been known that the miners were liable to diein middle-life from a respiratory disease locally named &apos; mountain sickness&apos;.It is now recognised that this condition is one of cancer of the lung and: it is generally accepted that there is a strong connexion between the excessivemortality from this disease and the high radioactive content of the air of the mines. Investigations have suggested that, up to 1939, nearly one-half of theminers who had died had contracted lung cancer.74. The first decay-product of radium is a gas, radon, which in its turndisintegrates, giving rise to a series of products, all of which are solids.Radon, being a gas, diffuses through the rocks containing the radium ore,. and escapes into the atmosphere of the mines. The inhalation of radon isknown to constitute a serious hazard, and the International Commission onRadiological Protection has advised that the concentration of this gas in theinspired air should not exceed O0001 microcuries per litre. A series . ofmeasurements of the radon content of the air of the mines, made between1924 and 1939, showed that the concentration of radon must then have been on the average about thirty times greater than the maximum permissiblelevel since laid down. The serious hazard incurred in breathing such an atmosphere comes, not only from the radon itself but also from its soliddaughter-products, which, being attached to dust particles in the atmosphere,may be retained in the chest and may irradiate the tissues of the lungs forlong periods.75. The average latent period for the induction of lung cancer in theseminers was about 17 years, and calculations have shown that the dose to thelungs during this period would have been equivalent to about 1,000 r. Thiscalculation assumes that the radiation dose is spread evenly over the lungs,but it may well be that some areas of the lung, depending on the sizes of theradioactively-charged dust particles which are inhaled, may be subjected todoses of more than 10,000 r over a whole working life. It is consistent withother knowledge that tumours could be induced under these conditions,particularly when it is remembered that radium itself and many of itsdaughter-products emit alpha particles with high biological efficiency.76. The only conditions in which an increased incidence of lung tumourshas been observed in association with radiation are those in which there isan increased risk of inhaling radon and the other daughter-products ofradium. In theory, however, the inhalation of radioactive material in par-ticulate form, either as a result of fall-out from nuclear weapon explosionsor in the vicinity of nuclear reactors, could lead to the accumulation of ahigh radiation dose within the lungs. Such particles would not be uniformlydistributed within the lungs but would tend to aggregate on discrete smallareas of the bronchi, which would thus be subjected to a high radiation dose,with the result that in the long run lung cancers might be produced in some people. In this country appropriate measures are always taken to eliminate the hazard in the vicinity of nuclear reactors, and it would be extremely unlikely to occur as a result of fall-out except in conditions of actual warfare.There is little evidence that external irradiation by X- or gamma rays cancause lung-tumours in man.Cancer of the bones and joints77. Radium and the daughter-products of thorium, when assimilated intothe body, tend to be held for long periods of time in the bones where, Jf
-   1in sufficiently high concentration, they may give rise to destruction and disease.A number of artificially produced radioactive isotopes, of which the mostimportant are strontium and plutonium, also show this predilection for bone.Radioactive strontium exists in several forms, one having a half-life of 53 days and strontium 90 of 28 years, whereas the half-life of plutonium 239 is about24,000 years. A warning of the potential danger from these artificial elementsis given by past experience of the effects of the natural elements radium,mesothorium and radiothorium after they have gained entrance to the body and become fixed in bone. (Appendix N.)78. Our knowledge of these effects comes mainly from the case-records of former workers in the luminising industry and of a group of patientsgiven radium compounds internally in the course of treatment. Stringentcontrols are now enforced in the luminising industry to protect the workers,and the prescription of radioactive substances for treatment has beencontrolled by legislation.79. Since 1925 there have been many reports of illness and death occurringamong a group of workers engaged in the painting of watch and clock dialswith luminous paint, most of whom had been in the industry during theperiod from 1916 to 1924. Luminous paint is compounded of zinc sulphideand radium, and, formerly, varying mixtures of radium, mesothorium andradiothorium were also used. It was customary for dial painters to apply theirpaint with fine brushes, the points of which they &quot;tipped&quot; between theirlips before painting. In this way they swallowed radioactive material, someof which became lodged in the skeleton. If large amounts were swallowed,death sometimes occurred, within about three years, from severe anaemia,haemorrhages, and infections, particularly of the bones of the jaw. Those whohad ingested smaller quantities of paint often developed cystic and necroticchanges in the bones which might cause &apos; rheumatic&apos; pains or fractures.Occasionally, these changes progressed and cancer of the bones appeared.Such tumours usually developed more than fifteen years after the firstexposure to the hazard.80. Similar effects have occurred in patients given radium compoundsinternally for the treatment of mental disease or for various rheumatic andother affections, and in people who, for quasi-medicinal reasons, have con-sumed large amounts of &apos; radioactive water&apos;. In animals strontium 90 hasbeen shown to produce similar biological effects.81. It is possible to estimate the amount of radium in the body of a living person, if there is good evidence that no other radioactive element ispresent in addition to the normal components of the body. Measurementscarried out on those who have been exposed to unknown mixtures, such asluminous compounds, are difficult to interpret. So far, no person is knownto have developed radiation-induced bone cancer who had less than 3-6 micro-curies of radium in his body, unless either mesothorium or radiothorium wasalso present; the lowest radium content, in the presence of one or other of these elements, has been 0-8 microcurie at the time of appearance ofthe tumour. On the other hand, it seems certain that early non-cancerouscystic changes in bones have developed with a body-content of as little as0-4 microcurie of radium alone. These amounts of radium are to be con-trasted with the maximum permissible level for body radium, which, as laiddown by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, is 0-1microcurie.82. Bone cancer has also been reported after the use of X-rays in thetreatment of non-malignant bone tumours and some infections. Such cancershave occurred only after very heavy doses of radiation and have originated32066 A 9
in the area of the body treated. The risk of the development of bone cancerat the levels of X- or gamma-radiation experienced under modern occupa-tional conditions is negligible.Cancer of the skin83. Cancer of the skin was the earliest form of radiation-induced tumourto be described in man. Radiation dermatitis of the hands, forearms and facewas common among the early radiologists and radiological technicians, andcancer often occurred in the damaged skin. By 1911 no fewer than 54cases had been described ; the occurrence of these tumours diminished asradiologists learned to take the necessary precautions.84. Since the early part of the century, records have accumulated of the occurrence of skin cancers following X-ray or radium treatment, in some instances, these tumours have followed the injudicious use of X-rays formild skin affections, or even for the removal of facial hair. The latent periodshave usually been long, ranging in a recently reported series of 13 cases from12 to 56 years, with an average of 33 years, Although it- is usually impossibleto make any accurate retrospective assessment of the doses of radiationreceived, the severity of damage to the skin suggests that, in these cases,they must have been of the order of several thousands of roentgens.Cancer of the thyroid gland, the pharynx and the larynx85. A number of cases of cancer of the thyroid gland have been reportedamong children, some years after they had been given X-ray treatment forconditions including suspected enlargement of the thymus gland, bronchitis,infected tonsils and adenoids, and enlarged glands in the neck. In many instances, the children were less than one year old when irradiated. In aseries of cases irradiated for suspected enlargement of the thymus gland,the average latent period between irradiation and the establishment of thediagnosis of cancer of the thyroid gland was only about 7 years. Perhaps themost important feature of these cases is the comparatively small dose of radiation responsible for induction of the tumour, in contrast to the largedoses associated with the induction of cancer in adults ; cancer of thethyroid gland has developed in a child after a recorded dose as low as 250 r.It is possible that hormonal factors may be involved in addition to the directeffect of irradiation.86. A few reports have drawn attention to the development, many yearslater, of cancers of the pharynx and larynx in patients who have had X-raytreatment for such conditions as tuberculous glands of the neck. The latentperiod is long, averaging about 20 years, and periods of more than 30 years have been recorded. In most cases, the irradiation was given in the early days of radiotherapy and there is practically no information available about the size of the radiation doses that were employed.effects on the blood other than leukaemia87. Observations have shown that, a fall in the numbers of red-cells,white-cells and platelets in the blood may occur in persons exposed to radia-tion in the course of their work. There is little direct information on thedose-response relationships, but it seems possible that, even with whole-bodydoses of gamma-rays as low as 1 r per week, slight changes can occur inthe white-cell count of especially susceptible people. Certainly, with dosesmuch in excess of 1 r per week, a general depression occurs in the white bloodcell count. A reduction in the numbers of red cells and platelets may occurat a later stage, and in some persons continued exposure may lead to severedegrees of anaemia,
a plastic anaemia88. If not detected in time, radiation-induced anaemias may endanger life,particularly when the red bone-marrow is itself so severely damaged thatthe red-cell deficiency cannot be made good by the production of new cells;this condition is known as &apos; a plastic anaemia&apos;. The diagnosis is not easy to make, and the condition can easily be confused with aleukaemic leukaemiaunless a full examination of the bone marrow is carried out. This diagnosticdifficulty was encountered during the investigation of leukaemia amongpatients treated with X-rays for ankylosing spondylitis. Particular attention was paid to deaths reported as being due to a plastic anaemia but, when these cases were fully investigated, evidence was found that a number were,in fact, aleukaemic leukaemia; eventually, only five deaths could withany certainty be ascribed to a plastic anaemia out of a total of some 50 deathsfrom leukaemia, a plastic anaemia and allied diseases combined. Similarly,only six reasonably certain cases of a plastic anaemia were reported fromNagasaki, compared with 40 cases of leukaemia in the same city. It seems clear, therefore, that a plastic anaemia is a rarer delayed effect of radiationthan leukaemia.induction of cataract89. The term &quot; cataract&quot; implies an opacity in the normally transparentlens of the eye, varying from a tiny granule which does not cause any definiteimpairment of vision, and which may disappear, to a large plaque resulting in blindness. It has been known for some time that exposure of the eye toX-rays can lead to cataract formation, but the large doses which appear tobe necessary for its induction are only likely to occur under very unusualconditions. For all practical purposes, therefore, the production of cataractby X-rays is not an occupational hazard, although it was discovered in 1948that the condition had developed among a group of physicists exposed toneutron irradiation during the operation of a cyclotron.90. In the following year there were reports from Japan of an increasedincidence of cataract in the populations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Theextent of the increase cannot be determined with precision, but it is significant that, of 98 cases of cataract among survivors of the Hiroshima explosion,85 occurred in persons who were within 1,000 metres of the centre of the explosion and would thus have been subjected to neutron- as well as gamma-irradiation. Confirmatory evidence of the high dosage which they had receivedis provided by the fact that most of them had suffered epilation of the scalpand that two subsequently developed leukaemia.effects on the skin other than cancer91. In the paragraphs dealing with the induction of skin cancers byirradiation, it was noted that cancers develop mainly in skin which has been subjected to such heavy doses of radiation as to be obviously damaged.Most of our knowledge of the less serious delayed effects on the skin hasbeen obtained from observation on the results of therapeutic irradiation withX-rays, during which the skin may be exposed to large doses of radiationdirected to underlying tissues. With doeses of 1,500 r or more, a certainamount of permanent skin-damage is likely to occur, but it will not be par-ticularly severe unless a large area has been irradiated. Larger doses, however,say of 4,000 r or more, are often followed by obvious skin-damage, the texturebecoming thinner, and the surface being usually covered with dilated bloodvessels. In such cases, the skin may be very sensitive and iprone to infection,and it is in this type of damaged skin that radiation-induced tumours are most likely to develop.
92. The hair follicles and glands of the skin may also be affected byradiation. A dose of the order of 300 to 400 r will cause temporary loss ofhair, and with higher doses, perhaps 700 r or more, hair-loss may be permanent. It is a common finding that, owing to the destruction of the sweatglands, heavily irradiated skin permanently loses its ability to sweat. Afterdoses of the order of 1,500 r, the sebaceous glands are destroyed and theskin loses its normal greasy texture.effects on the kidney and lung93. It has been reported that therapeutic doses of X-rays to the region of the kidneys may affect their function and lead to the development of ahigh blood pressure which may prove fatal. The damage described has followed the treatment of certain rare tumours with large doses of radiationand it is unlikely that such effects will occur under other conditions ofexposure. It has also been reported that pneumonitis, sometimes fatal, has followed radiotherapy directed towards the chest.shortening of the life-span94. A number of reports based on observations made on animals suggestthat exposure to ionizing radiations may lead to an overall reduction in the expectation of life. No evidence has yet been published that this occurs inman.The Effects of Exposure to Radiation during PregnancyAbortion and stillbirth95. After heavy doses of radiation, a pregnant woman may miscarryor give birth to a stillborn child. Information from the Atomic BombCasualty Commission shows that in Hiroshima and Nagasaki there wasa higher abortion and stillbirth rate among pregnant women near the explosion than among those of greater distances. Of 98 pregnantwomen in Nagasaki who were within 2,000 metres of the centre of the explosion, about 23 per cent of those who had severe radiation illnessmiscarried, in comparison with only about 4 per cent of those who did not develop any severe illness, and with about 3 per cent of women who were between 4,000 and 5,000 metres distant. It is apparent thatabortion and stillbirth as a result of irradiation during pregnancy donot constitute a problem unless the dose of radiation is large.Effects on the children of women irradiated during pregnancy96. There is considerable evidence, both from the case records of patients treated with radiotherapy and from reports published by the AtomicBomb Casualty Commission, that heavy irradiation of pregnant womencan lead to the birth of children who are either abnormal at birth or wholater develop in an abnormal way. The case records of women therapeuticallyirradiated during pregnancy describe a number of different developmentalabnormalities in their children, the most striking of which is the conditionknown as &apos; microcephaly&apos; ; one such case was found during the course ofour investigation of patients treated by X-rays for ankylosing spondylitis.The underlying cause of this condition is a partial failure of the develop-ment of the brain, as a result of which the head is smaller than that ofa normal baby. All grades of the-condition exist, ranging from the mostsevere, in which the child usually has to be maintained in a mentalinstitution, to others in which there is only slight impairment of development and mental powers. &apos;
97. There are published records of eleven mentally-retarded children inNagasaki and Hiroshima who were exposed before birth at a distance of between 700 and 1,200 metres from the centre of the explosion. Tenof the mothers of these children suffered acutely from the effects of radiation,and the eleventh probably did so. The head circumferences of all elevenchildren were appreciably less than those of unirradiated Japanese children of -the same age-group and, in the case of the Nagasaki children, smaller than those of children exposed before birth at distances of between 4,000and 5,000 metres from the explosion, where the dose of prompt radiationwould have been less than 1 r. The evidence from Hiroshima suggeststhat children irradiated between the twelfth and eighteenth weeks of intra-uterine life are more likely to develop microcephaly than children irradiatedeither before or after this period.The Effect on Fertility of Exposure to RadiationPermanent sterility98. It is well-established that irradiation may reduce the fertility of menand women, and even render them permanently sterile. In men, a singledose of 500 r to the testes would probably produce permanent sterility.The dose to the ovaries likely to produce the same result in women would depend to some extent upon the age of the woman concerned; a womannearing the end of her reproductive life would require a smaller dose,about 300 r, than a woman in her early reproductive years. These levels of dose are so high that, if they were received in the course of whole-bodyirradiation, the individual would develop the early acute illness already described. It is extremely unlikely, therefore, that permanent sterilitywould be induced in any one accidentally exposed to a large whole-bodydose, unless this illness had been manifest.99. Under modern conditions of occupational exposure, for example amongradiologists and radiographers, there is no evidence of any impairment offertility. Furthermore, there is no suggestion that female radiographers suffer from radiation-induced menstrual disturbances which might be accompaniedby diminished fertility.
CHAPTER iv the GENETIC EFFECTS OF RADIATIONIntroduction100. Nowhere in our report have we been more conscious of the difficultiesof the task which we have undertaken, and of the limitations of the knowledgeat our disposal, than in considering the genetic effects of radiation. the established scientific evidence in this field provides but an insecure basis on which to frame answers to the many important questions that are nowbeing asked. Consequently we have been forced to make many assumptionsof questionable validity and our conclusions must be regarded as provisional and treated with a measure of reserve. As an essential part of future studies,there is an urgent need for the collection of more detailed vital statistics.Moreover, it must be realised that genetic studies inevitably tend to be slowand that sufficient knowledge on which to base firm conclusions will beaccumulated only after many years of intensified fundamental research.The Material Basis of Heredity: 101. In man and other sexually reproducing animals, every individualarises from a single living cell, which is formed by the fusion of two germcells, an egg cell from the mother and a sperm cell from the father. soon after it is fertilised, the egg cell divides into two ; each of these dividesagain, to give a total of four, and this process is repeated until there areenough cells to give rise to all the organs and tissues of the body, among them the sex glands from which in time new germ cells will be formed.Chromosomes and genes102. Each cell contains within it a nucleus whose essential componentis a number of microscopic thread-like structures, the chromosomes. Theseare aggregates of sub-microscopic particles the genes which determine the hereditary nature of the individual. The total number of genes in acell is not known with any accuracy but it is certainly high, perhapsthousands or even tens of thousands in a human cell. Each chromosomecarries a large number of them arranged in order along its length, so that each gene has its own special place, or locus, in a particular chromosome.Cell division103. The nucleus of each human germ cell carries 24 chromosomes, all of them different from one another. When egg and sperm come together,their nuclei also fuse, so that the fertilised egg contains a nucleus carrying48 chromosomes constituting 24 pairs. The members of a pair, derivedone from the mother via the egg and one from the father via the sperm,normally correspond to each other both in the gene loci which they carryand in the order in which these loci are arranged. When the fertilised egg,or any later cell in the body, is about to divide, a replica is first formedof each of the 48 chromosomes. This makes it possible for the two cellsso produced to receive sets of chromosomes exactly like each other andlike those of the parent cell. The cell divisions immediately preceding theformation of germ cells, however, follow a somewhat different pattern, which
results in the egg or sperm receiving only one member of each pair ofchromosomes ; thus the number that the egg or sperm contains is reducedto 24.Gene mutation104. In the normal course of events, each cell possesses a set of genesidentical with those of the cell from which it is derived. Occasionally, how-ever, a sudden change occurs in a gene, which is converted into a slightlydifferent form. The altered form of the gene is spoken of as a new alleleand the process of change is known as mutation. Once such a mutation hasoccurred, the gene is reproduced and passed on in the new form at allsubsequent cell divisions. Thus, each locus can come to be represented inthe population by a number of these variants or alleles.Homozygotes and heterozygotes105. Having but one chromosome of each kind, the germ cell carries onlyone allele at each gene locus, whereas the body cells, with a pair of eachkind of chromosome, carry two alleles. These two alleles may or may notbe exactly the same. An individual bearing two identical alleles is saidto be homozygous at that particular locus ; one with two different allelesis said to be heterozygous at the locus. A homozygous individual clearlymust have received the same allele from each of his parents and he willpass it on to all his offspring. A heterozygous individual must have receiveddifferent alleles from his two parents, and he will on the average pass on one of the two to half his offspring and the other to the other half. Thissorting out of the genes in their distribution to the offspring of a. heterozygoteis a direct result of the halving of the number of chromosomes duringgerm cell formation and is known as segregation.Gene reassortment106. If an individual is heterozygous for two or more loci, the processof segregation will result in his genes being reassorted into new combinationsin his offspring. Thus, in the process of reproduction, the various allelesat the different loci are continually being reassorted into an immense variety of combinations, with the result that each person has a particular here-ditary constitution not exactly like that of anyone else. Each of us is, infact, genetically unique, with the exception of identical twins, who are pro-duced when the fertilised egg very early in its development splits into two parts each of which gives rise to a complete individual.Dominant and recessive alleles107. Some alleles produce a noticeable effect only on those individuals who are homozygous for them. Such alleles and the characters which theydetermine are spoken of as recessive. Other alleles have some effect even when the individual is heterozygous, and the characters which these determineare described as dominant. Among the numerous genes which have been studied in.man and other animals, all gradations are known between theextremes of fully recessive alleles, which have no effect at all on theheterozygote, and fully dominant ones which have as strong an effect onthe heterozygote as on the homozygote.108. A dominant allele which is being transmitted in a family will bemanifest in every generation unless it dies out. A recessive allele, on the otherhand, can be transmitted to later generations by an individual who showsno sign of carrying the allele in question. The character produced by such
a gene will appear from time to time in the population, in families whereboth parents carry the gene ; this is especially likely to occur where there is amarriage between cousins.Sex-linked genes109. There is a special category of genes whose inheritance is connectedwith the determination of sex. The sex of an individual is determined by one particular chromosome pair. In the female, both chromosomes of the pairare similar ; in the male, one is of another type. Thus, the structure of thefemale sex chromosome pair can be represented as XX, that of the male asXY. Genes carried on these chromosomes are said to be sex-linked, but theY chromosome, having few gene loci, has little effect on most hereditarycharacters. If a male contains an abnormal allele on his X chromosome,he will show its effect, even if the same allele situated on one of the twoX chromosomes of a female would be recessive. If a recessive sex-linkedgene is uncommon, it will occur only very rarely on both the X chromo-somes of a female and the characteristics it produces will therefore not often be found in females. They will be commoner among males, who will beaffected whenever their single X chromosome contains the allele. Theapparently normal females can, however, transmit the chromosome carry-ing the affected gene to the next generation, and so act as carriers of theabnormality. The classical example of this type of condition is the diseasehaemophilia, which appears in males but is transmitted by apparentlynormal females.Continuous variation110. Not all gene differences have effects which are sufficiently distinctto be recognised by their segregation among the members of a family. as can be seen in human stature and intelligence, for example, some charac-teristics vary by continuous gradation over a wide range which is regarded asnormal. Such characters are believed to be controlled by the combined actionof a large number of genes, the effects of which are supplementary and eachso small that they are not individually distinguishable.Causes of mutation111. Reference has already been made to the process of mutation bywhich one allele changes into another. We do not know all the factors whichcause mutation. It is believed to be due sometimes to chance disturbanceof the complex molecules which constitute the genes, and sometimes toexternal influences such as certain chemicals or natural background radia-tion. We shall discuss later the extent to which naturally occurring muta-tions are likely to be attributable to background radiation, but from observa-tion of organisms other than man it is known that other causes can be important. Present evidence suggests that mutations, whatever their origin,are for the most part random changes not specifically related to the natureof the stimulus or to the needs of the individual.Mutation rate112. So far as is known, all genes are subject to mutation, and, over thepopulation as a whole, mutation is continually occurring at a definite but very low rate. Factors influencing mutation increase the rates at which thegenes change ; they do not produce changes of a completely novel type.Most genes, if not all, are susceptible to such factors, though some may beaffected more readily than others. No methods are yet known for stimulating the mutation of only one particular gene, or even of a small selected group of genes.
Mutation and natural selection113. The hereditary variation found in human or other populations isthe result of mutations which occurred in past generations. New alleleswhich cause abnormalities harmful to those who possess them tend to be eliminated from the population. Thus, a new dominant allele causing deathbefore the reproductive age, or for some other reason preventing theindividual from leaving descendants, is eliminated in one generation. those with less drastic effects are eliminated with a speed related to the severity ofthe handicap which they impose. Recessive alleles, which give rise to harmfulconditions only when they are in the homozygous state, are also eliminated,but very slowly, since the allele can continue to exist or to spread in theheterozygous state without contributing any significant handicap to the perpetuation of the line. Thus, in the case of both dominant and recessiveharmful aljleles, natural selection ,is (constantly operating (towards their removal from the population. Equally, it will operate even against geneswhose effects are valuable to the individual during his own lifetime, if theyreduce his chances of leaving offspring.114. For few alleles which increase the chances of leaving offspring thesituation is the reverse. Those individuals in which these effects are manifestare more than ordinarily likely to propagate their kind, so that theirdescendants tend to become the predominant type. Many, but perhaps not all, of the genes which tend to increase fertility will also have effects whichare useful in other ways to the individual in whom they are manifest; theycan be considered as generally advantageous.115. Between these clear-cut examples there are genes with every gradationof effect. The manifestations of genetic abnormality in the individual mayvary from the itrivial to the disastrous. The action of some genes is delayed until after the end of the reproductive period of life and they are thereforelargely immune from the eliminating influence of natural selection. Thereare genes which are harmful whether, the individual carrying them ishomozygous or heterozygous ; there are others which are advantageous toheterozygotes and harmful to homozygotes. The relative prevalence of anyparticular allele, in any particular population, can be understood only inthe light of the relationship between the environment and the advantagesor disadvantages of the condition to which the allele gives rise.Genetic equilibrium116. As natural selection is constantly operating towards the elimination of harmful genes from the population, the incidence of the conditions towhich they give rise would steadily decrease, were it not that they are beingreplenished by the occurrence of new mutations. Their frequency, will there-fore tend to reach the level at which their loss by selection is balanced bynew mutation. A state of genetic equilibrium has then been reached. Thisis the situation with regard to many of the more harmful abnormalities ofman, the incidence of which remains relatively steady in the populationdespite the failure of those affected to leave normal numbers of offspring.The general effects of increasing the mutation rate117. The above considerations suggest the broad qualitative effects whichcan be expected to follow an appreciable increase in the mutation rate. Atthis present time, the advantageous alleles that have appeared in the past arealready widespread and will have become part of the normal constitutionof the population. An increase in the rate at which they are produced can therefore have little effect. The harmful alleles, on the other hand, havebeen restricted to a low incidence by the operation of natural selection. A
significant increase in the rate at which these are produced will therefore have a more easily detectable effect. The general inference is that increasingthe mutation rate in a human population would have a relatively muchgreater effect upon the incidence of harmful than upon that of harmless or ofadvantageous hereditary traits.Mutation and the adaptability of populations118. Mutation provides the means by which the human race, throughhundreds of thousands of years, has successfully adapted itself to its environ-ment. There is no reason to believe that this adaptation has proceeded bysudden and conspicuous changes in human characteristics. The consensus ofopinion is that evolution has occurred by a succession of small variationsfrom the average, which conferred a slight but eventually important advan-tage in relation to the trend of environmental change. It is the existence ofthis galaxy of hereditary traits, varying only slightly from the accepted normal,that has conferred adaptability upon the human race. The recurrence of asmall but steady incidence of harmful mutations is the price that has to bepaid for this asset.THE GENETIC EFFECTS OF RADIATION: BASIC PRINCIPLES119. There is as yet little direct information about the genetic effects ofionizing radiations on man and, for reasons which we examine later, the fewobservations that have so far been made present many difficulties of interpre-tation. We have therefore to rely on information obtained from experimentson other organisms. The experimental evidence is itself incomplete and largelyderived from observations on forms of life other than mammals, tout a generalpicture is beginning to emerge which appears to be consistent for theorganisms which it has been practicable to study. The question arises, how-ever, to what extent it is justifiable to draw inferences concerning man fromthe reactions of remote organisms observed under the artificial conditionsof laboratory experiment. Since the genetic mechanism in man is the sameas that in other animal and plant species, and since the animals and plantsthat have been studied all show the same type of genetic response to ionizingradiations, it would be unreasonable to suppose that the response in manwill do other than follow the same general pattern. On the other hand, wedo not think that conclusions derived solely from observations on otherorganisms offer a secure basis for quantitative estimates concerning man and, except where we have explicitly stated the contrary, we have not usedthem for this purpose.Effects of radiation on germ cells120. Ionizing radiation will have genetic consequences only in so far as it affects any of the germ cells or the cells ancestral to them in the reproductiveorgans. It may then have one or other of three results : the affected cellsmay die, their chromosomes may be broken, or the genes may be caused tomutate.121. Death of a germ cell, or indeed of any cell ancestral to it, can have nogenetic consequence, because this very death will terminate the lineage ofcells to which it belongs.Chromosome structural change122. Chromosome breakage may also lead to death of the cell lineage.Broken chromosomes may fail to reunite or they may join up to give newforms of chromosomes which are incapable of passing through the processof cell division in the normal way ; either of these circumstances leads to
consequent death of the cell lineage. If the damage occurs in an immaturegerm cell in the sex gland, the cell lineage will usually die before mature germcells are formed, and ithere will be no genetic consequences. If it occurs in amature germ cell which later participates in fertilisation, the ensuing embryowill usually die early in gestation, and the ultimate genetic consequenceswill be minimal.123. Chromosome breakage may, however, have a different outcome if thefragments reunite in new patterns which are capable of passing throughcell division. The resulting kinds of structurally changed chromosomes maybe transmitted to apparently normal offspring, and at least one type of change will manifest itself by the occurrence of repeated abortions or mal-formations among the descendants of the irradiated individual. Experimentson mammals indicate that this inherited effect will appear only if conceptiontakes place within a few months of irradiation.124. Such structural changes of the chromosomes are induced especially by large single doses of radiation, for example heavy doses of X-raysor the prompt radiation from atomic bombs. They are induced only rarelyby long-continued exposure to low-intensity X- or gamma radiation,although relatively small doses Of neutrons or alpha particles are more effective in bringing them about.125. Although they may cause partial sterility or abortion in their carriers,major structural changes of the chromosomes do not as a rule bring aboutother kinds of abnormality in individuals bearing them. For this reason,and also because of their low rates of spontaneous occurrence and inductionby chronic irradiation, and of the probability of their having an adverse effect on fertility, chromosome structural changes are likely to be of com-paratively little importance among the radiation hazards to man.Induced gene mutation126. The third and, from the genetical point of view, the most important effect of exposing germ cells to additional radiations is the induction of increased gene mutation. Since all germ cells from time immemorial have been continuously exposed to some radiation from natural sources, it would besurprising if exposure to additional radiation were found to induce anynovel types of mutation. The results of experiment support this view : the types already known recur, but at an enhanced rate.Proportionality of induced gene mutation to additional radiation127. There is no known threshold for the induction of gene mutationsby radiation: that is to say, any additional exposure, no matter howsmall, must be expected to raise the mutation rate, if only by a minuteamount. Furthermore, to judge by our experience up to the present, it isprobably true that the rise in the rate of mutations is directly proportionalto the amount of additional exposure. This law is known to hold good, forsuch organisms as have been studied, when the radiation dose is fairlyhigh. It is also known to hold good for the induction of one class of lethalgenes in the fruit-fly, Drosophila melanogaster, by X-ray doses as lowas 25 r. In this chapter of our report we are chiefly concerned with doseswell below this level; but, for the present, there does not appear to besufficient evidence to warrant the assumption that there is any real departure from this law even at the lowest doses, and proportionality has therefore been accepted as the basis of what follows.32066 A10
Accumulated dose to germ cell lineage128. Cells arise only from pre-existing cells. Mature germ cells areproduced from a line of ancestral immature cells which have been present at every instant during the individual^ life, from conception onwards. It willbe remembered that mutated genes reproduce themselves as faithfully in acell lineage as do the normal genes from which they arise. In consequence,the mutated genes arising throughout a germ cell lineage will be accumulatedin the mature germ cell, and a given radiation dose will therefore havethe same order of effect whether it is given over a short or a long periodof time. In other words, long continued exposure to low-intensity radiationinduces as much gene mutation as a single exposure to high-intensityradiation, provided that the total dose is the same. Experiments have shownthat this probably remains true even when the dose is split into a series ofsmall fractions, and no matter what interval elapses between the separateirradiations. Thus, in contrast to most other itpyes of biological response toradiation, damage to the genetic material cannoit be repaired and the effect from repeated exposures is cumulative.Genetically effective dose to a population129. This cumulative effect of radiation indicates that the genetic effects of exposure will depend on the ages of the individuals exposed as well ason the dose they receive. If, for example, all are past the reproductiveage, the genetic effects will be nil; if they are younger, the possible numberof offspring they may have is of importance. The age distribution of thoseexposed is therefore an important factor to take into account when estimating the consequences to future generations of additional radiation.The Effects of Increased Mutation Rates on the Incidence of Diseasein Human Populations130. In approaching the problem of making some quantitative assessment of the genetic effects of radiation upon a human population, we have beenvery conscious of the inadequacy of the evidence in two essential respects.First, we do not know the dose of radiation required to double the mutationrate of any specified human gene ; secondly, there is reason to suspect thatthe radiosenskivity of human genes may vary considerably, so that it couldbe very misleading to treat them as an approximately uniform group whichwould respond to any particular dose of radiation with a standard increase inmutation.131. It is, however, possible to give a general idea of the effects of anincrease in the mutation rate of particular human genes without raising thequestion of dose or degree of uniformity in sensitivity to radiation. We have therefore taken selected examples of disease in which genetical factors are known to play an important part, and have attempted to assess the effectsin a human population of doubling the spontaneous mutation rates of thegenes concerned, without specifying the agent or agents causing this increased rate of mutation.132. The role of heredity in the production of disease ranges from thatof a predisposing to that of a preponderating cause. Thus, there is some evidence that heredity is a factor influencing susceptibility to tuberculosis ;but this could be of no significance unless the individual were infectedwith tubercle bacilli. On the other hand, achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism,is probably determined entirely by genetic factors, in the sense that no knownmodification of the environment can prevent its appearance in those whopossess the necessary gene.
133. In making our assessment we have confined our attention to those conditions which impose a significant handicap and which are determined,entirely or to an important extent, by hereditary factors. To put it another way, our object has been to give an assessment of the social load that wouldbe imposed upon a population, like that of this country, by increasingmutation rates. We propose to consider two possible situations: first, whenthe mutation rate of every gene concerned is supposed to have been doubledin one generation only, thereafter reverting to its former level, and secondlywhen the rates having been doubled remain at that new level generationafter generation.the effects of  doubling mutation rates  on diseasesdue to a  single gene134. In the case of abnormal genes with effects which are masked in anyway, either by normal alleles as in recessive traits or by the influence ofenvironment, mutation has less immediate or less apparent consequences thanin the case of genes with effects which are directly manifest, as in dominanttraits. Severely disabling dominant diseases reveal the results of recentmutation most readily. Sex-linked traits show a less rapid response. Theeffects of genes which produce recessive traits are masked until two genescome together in the homozygous state ; hence, the results of their recentmutation will be less noticeable, although in the course of time their fulleffects will appear. Where a gene is common and mainly benign, but canoccasionally cause disease, the results of its recent mutation will scarcely bedetectable.135. The effects which might be expected to result from an increase inmutation rates can most easily be calculated for diseases known to be causedby single genes. For this purpose we need to know what proportion of cases in a given generation is due to recurrent fresh mutation (Appendix C). the incidence of the particular disease in the population must be ascertained ;so must its mode of inheritance (dominant, partially recessive, recessive orsex-linked), the degree to which it handicaps or favours the affected indi-viduals as shown by their length of life and reproductive capacity and themodifying effect, if any, of environmental factors (Appendix D). this information is available for only a relatively few conditions and much moreresearch will be required before we can feel reasonably confident in makingestimates for groups of diseases, To illustrate the different types of effect,we have chosen three examples about which we have some fairly accurate information.(0 A dominant trait136. Achondroplasia (chondrodystrophia) is a dominant form of dwarfism.Although there are many clinical types, it will be assumed for the present purpose that the condition is due to a single gene with a manifestation whichis independent of environmental factors. The incidence at birth, accordingto Danish estimates, is one in 9,400. Biological fitness is greatly reduced on account of high stillbirth rates, and also in adult life on account of low fertility, especially of females. The chance that an affected individualwill have offspring is estimated at only 1 in 5. The majority of cases are believed to arise through fresh mutation.137. Doubling the mutation rate of the causal gene for one generationwould produce an 80 per cent increase in the incidence of the condition inthe first generation, that is the incidence at birth would rise to nearly one in 5$00. The excess would, however, rapidly disappear and within five or six generations the incidence would return to normal (Fig. la). If the32066 A11

mutation rate were permanently doubled, the incidence would rise to a level close to double the present figure within three or four generations(Fig. lb).(ii) A sex-linked trait138. The term haemophilia covers a group of sex-linked traits in whichthere is impairment of blood clotting. For the present purpose it will beassumed that all severe cases are caused by abnormal alleles at a single locus.The incidence is at least 1 in 12,000 of the male population at birth andthe chances that an affected male will survive and have descendants is about one in eight. Females carrying the abnormal gene are healthy and havenormal chances of reproduction. Doubling the mutation rate for one genera-tion would produce a 29 per cent increase in incidence in the followinggeneration, that is, the incidence would rise to about 1 in 9,300. In the nextgeneration this level would be sustained but thereafter it would sink backmoderately quickly towards the previous level (Fig. la). If the mutationrate were permanently doubled, the incidence would rise to 90 per cent above the previous level in about six generations, and thereafter slowlyapproach the point where the incidence was doubled (Fig. lb).(iii) A recessive trait139. Phenylketonuria is an example of a deleterious recessive trait asso-ciated with severe mental deficiency. Its incidence in the population atbirth is about 1 in 40,000 and, although the early mortality is not high, the chance that an affected person will have offspring is practically nil. A doublingof the mutation rate in one generation would cause an increase of one percent in the incidence of the disease in the first generation. If allowance weremade for the effects of inbreeding, a further small increase would be predicted sometime after the second generation and this would be followedby a very slow return to the previous level (Fig. la). The response to apermanent doubling of the mutation rate would be a slow rise by almostequal increments. It would take more than 50 generations of 30 years eachto increase the incidence by 50 per cent, and many more to approach anincrease of 100 per cent (Fig. lb).the effects of doubling mutation rates on broadgroups of diseases140. The three examples given above illustrate the kind of result to beexpected from doubling the mutation rates of genes representing each of thethree classical types of genetical effect. A large number of dominant, sex-linked and recessive diseases are known ; many of them are rarities buttogether they may account for a relatively large proportion of serioushereditary disability in the population. However, to give an idea of theextent of the problem of hereditary disability, and the total results ofdoubling the mutation rates of the genes which are responsible, commoncategories of illness must be considered. Our information, from the geneticalpoint of view, is unfortunately not often precise and. in addition, the effects of genes are in many cases modified by environment. Mental diseases andmental deficiency, when taken together, account for nearly half the hospitalpopulation in this country and are the most important inclusive category inwhich hereditary causes are known to be important. We shall first considersevere mental defect and then the two main types of mental illness.(0 Severe mental defect141. The incidence in the population of cases of severe mental deficiencywhich survive has been estimated to be about 1 in 500. It is higher than this at birth but subsequently reduced by the heavy mortality in early life. Beyond32066 A12
this, there are grossly affected individuals, many with malformations of thenervous system, who are stillborn or who do not survive early infancy but whowould have been mentally defective ; the incidence of such cases is at least Lin200. The number of cases of severe defect at all ages surviving in England,Wales and Scotland may be nearly 100,000. The fact that not far from 30,000hospital beds are provided for these cases indicates the extent of the medical care required.142. In this broad category of disease, conditions with dominant inheritanceinclude epiloia (sebaceous adenoma with tuberose sclerosis), several types of acrocephaly, hypertelorism and neurofibromatosis. In such diseases, manyof the severely affected cases, say one half, can be attributed to recurrentfresh mutation. Doubling of all the mutation rates, for one generation, wouldhave a large effect in the subsequent generation, and a permanent doubling ofthe mutation rates would soon permanently double the incidence. We maysuppose that diseases such as these, collected together, form four per cent ofall surviving cases of severe mental defect, as shown in Table 1. If all mutationrates were doubled, this would add 50 per cent to the numbers of these cases in the first generation, that is to say two new cases in every 100 in the wholecategory, an increase which would mean a thousand extra cases requiringmedical care.TABLE 1Effect of doubling imitation rates of genes concerned with severe mental deficiency : cases per generation classified according to probable causationType of Diagnosis		Probable causation	Surviving cases of severe mental deficiency under present conditions (0*       (ii)t		Increase in first generation if mutation rates are doubled (0*       (ii)t	Acrocephaly     ...      ...&quot; Epiloia   ...

143. A few rare diseases causing severe mental defect are known to bedue to sex-linked genes, for example one type of microphthalmos and one type of gargoylism (Hurler&apos;s syndrome). The contribution of this group to the total number of defectives is small and can hardly exceed half of oneper cent of severe cases. Nevertheless, for the reason given above, diseasesof this kind must be due to genes with significant mutation rates : if these rates were doubled in one generation, the incidence at birth of the diseaseswould he increased by nearly one-third, as in haemophilia. After a doublingof the mutation rates in one generation, there would be an increase of 0T5 percent in the total number of cases of severe mental defect, or 75 extra casesrequiring medical care.144. Other important known genetical causes of mental defect are recessiveconditions, such as the two kinds of amaurotic idiocy, phenylketonuria,cerebral diplegia, and &quot; true&quot; microcephaly. Known conditions caused inthis manner account for 20 per cent of low grade mental defect and the sametype of causation may easily account for twice as much as this. The casefrequency of these traits individually is low, that is about one in 40,000 in thepopulation at birth ; about 20 conditions of this type are already known and perhaps another 20 may exist undetected. Since these diseases are allvery deleterious, so that those affected scarcely ever have offspring, it isgenerally accepted that the genes causing them arise continually by spon-taneous mutation. As previously explained, the reason for this assumption isthat the incidence in the population can only be maintained if loss of genesthrough failure of reproduction is balanced by an equivalent appearance ofnew mutations. From this consideration the mutation rates can be estimated for these recessive traits but the method is indirect and the results are impre-cise ; they are likely to be too high. A doubling of mutation rates in onegeneration would cause a one per cent increase in the incidence of each lethalrecessive trait the original incidence of which is one in 40,000. If 40 per cent of severe mental deficency were determined in this manner, doubling mutationrates would cause an increase of 0-4 per cent in the whole category or 200extra cases requiring medical care.145. The problem of mongolism, a disease responsible for between 10 and15 per cent of all cases of severe mental defect living in the population,requires separate consideration. There is strong evidence of a geneticalelement in the causation but maternal age is also a very significant factor.The hereditary predisposition must be very common and only harmfulin exceptional circumstances. Although a slight increase in incidence mightbe expected as a result of doubling mutation rates, the nature of the pre-disposition is so imperfectly understood at the present time that it doesnot seem useful to make a numerical estimate for this condition.146. As shown in Table 1, 43 per cent of the cases are not yet accountedfor. Among these, there must be a large group in which injury or infectionis the main cause, perhaps 15 per cent of all cases of mental defect.A still larger number of cases are of quite unknown origin, althoughgenetical factors may have some influence. Furthermore, there may be aresidual proportion of cases due to relatively common genes, acting eithersingly or in combination with one another, on which the effect of increasedmutation could be appreciable. It is impossible to make quantitative pre-dictions about mutation for this group with unknown causation but thenumber of cases ordinarily caused by fresh mutation must be very small.147. The conclusion is that, after doubling all mutation rates, an overallincrease of three per cent in the category of low grade mental deficiency inone generation is possible; in a generation of 20 million births the known32066 A13
surviving cases would number 50,000 and an increase of three per cent wouldmean 1,500 additional cases requiring care. If the mutation rate remainedpermanently doubled, the incidence in the population would, on the mostpessimistic assumptions, eventually, after very many generations, double alsoand twice as much medical care would accordingly be needed.(//&apos;) Mental illness148. Current theories concerning the genetical factors underlying mental illness imply that a small but substantial proportion of cases must owetheir origin to the recurrence of mutations. This is almost certainly truefor Huntington&apos;s chorea, a rare dominant disease. For the common diseasegroups, schizophrenia and manic-depressive reaction, the situation is lessclear. According to figures for 1954, there were approximately 63,000 casesof schizophrenia and 31,000 cases of manic-depressive reaction under hospitalcare in England, Scotland and Wales. Since these diseases account for about half of all mental illness, it may be worthwhile to attempt a rough estimateof the effects of changing mutation rates upon their incidence.149. Theoretically, any genes responsible for conditions, like mental illness,which lower biological fitness to a marked degree would have beeneliminated from the population, or would have become very rare, unless they had been continually replaced by fresh mutation. However, there areuncertainties about the relevant facts concerning the genetics of schizophreniaand manic-depressive reaction. First, the incidence of these diseases inthe population is not accurately recorded ; secondly, the biological fitnessof predisposed and even of affected individuals has not been fully investi-gated; thirdly, the nature of the genetical contribution is known only by surmise ; and, fourthly, nothing definite is known about possible com-compensating mechanisms which might, if they existed, make unnecessary theassumption of gene replacement by freshly recurrent mutation.150. Calculation, on the basis of elementary and simplified assumptions about gene action, leads to the conclusion that doubling the mutation ratemight have the effect of raising the incidence of schizophrenia by a factor of one per cent and of manic-depressive reaction by a factor of T4 percent in the first generation. It is not possible to estimate the number of extra hospital beds which this proportional increase in frequency of geneticalpredisposition would imply. We can, however, obtain an idea of the expectednumber of extra chronically incapacitated patients from the calculationsset out in Appendix E. The total number of such cases which wouldappear among the first generation of 20 million births after doubling mutationrates would be 200 schizophrenics and 200 manic depressives. The numberof extra patients needing psychiatric care at one or other time during their lives, on account of these genetical predispositions, would be from 5 to 10times as great. A permanent doubling of mutation rates would have in eachsucceeding generation an effect similar to that in the first generation. Thus,over a very long period of time, the number of cases would slowly increaseuntil the limiting value of twice the initial number was approached.(///) Blindness151. A frequent cause of severe disability is blindness. The extent of themorbidity is shown by the fact that every year, in England and Wales, 12,500new cases of blindness are registered. These include cases of developmentalabnormality, tumours, metabolic diseases and the results of injury andinfection. The genetical background is extremely varied but at least half ofthe hereditary cases can be attributed to single genes, often recessive likethose causing retinal degeneration, though a few are dominant like that for
fetinoblastoma ; some are known to be sex-linked. High myopia is believed to have a complex genetical background. The important cases from thepresent point of view are those with onset in early life and about three-quarters of all such cases of blindness are thought to be hereditary. About300 children between the ages of 0 and 15 years are registered as blindannually. Severe cases in the causation of which mutation is likely to play an important part will mostly be in this group which includes aniridia,microphthalmos and retinoblastoma. The mutation rates for these dominantdiseases are listed in Appendix C. Assuming that these figures apply toEngland, Wales and Scotland, we can estimate that, in one generation of20,000,000 births, there would be 80 cases of aniridia, 80 cases of micro-phthalmos and (using the mean of three estimates) 560 cases of retino-blastoma due to spontaneous mutation in ordinary circumstances. these numbers would be almost doubled if the mutation rates were doubled forone generation. If the mutation rates were permanently doubled, this increase would be continued until the total incidence of these diseases was doubled,as was calculated for achondroplasia.152. Numerous causes of blindness due to recessive conditions are known,and some of them are sex-linked. Figures for the incidence of these traitsare not well enough established for the effects of doubling mutation rates to be estimated.(iv) Neonatal deaths, stillbirths and congenital malformations153. An increase in mutation rates would be expected to have an effect upon the abortion, stillbirth and neonatal death rates and upon the incidence of congenital malformations. These deaths and malformations are knownto be caused in large part by the environment of the unborn child, whichmay be affected by illnesses and other conditions in the mother. Many maybe due to single recessive genes, some to chromosome abnormalities andothers are known to be caused by immunological incompatibility betweenmother and foetus. For these reasons we have not found it possible to makedetailed calculations of the kind used above for other conditions, but it is certain that the total effects of doubling mutation rates in one generationwould be slight. Observations on these foetal conditions in actual circum-stances where the mutation rates might have been increased have been madeon human populations and are discussed below in paragraphs 162 to 170.THE OVERALL LOAD OF ILLNESS IMPOSED BY DOUBLING ALLMUTATION RATES154. We have expressed the opinion that, from the standpoint of the socialload imposed, mental diseases constitute the most important single category of disease which is determined to a marked degree by heredity andwhich is serious, in the sense both of being highly harmful to the individual and of making heavy demands on medical resources. We are aware thatthis is only an opinion and that others may have different views. We believe,however, that it will be conceded by all that the mental diseases contributea very substantial proportion of the total number of those suffering fromserious hereditary disorders. It seems reasonable, therefore, to suggest thatthe total increase in the social load due to serious hereditary illness of all kinds,which would follow doubling all mutation rates, would be unlikely to exceed more than a few times the estimates we have given for mental defectand mental illness combined.155. Hereditary diseases are sometimes thought of as incurable, and it istrue that present knowledge provides no grounds for believing that cures will
be found for some of the grosser forms. With the advance of medical science,however, it has become possible to alleviate many hereditary conditions oreven to maintain the affected patients in good health. A classical example isdiabetes mellitus, into the causation of which a hereditary factor enters inmany cases. Before the discovery of insulin, the majority of diabetics weredestined for invalidism or premature death. Now with its aid they liveessentially normal lives. With further advances of medical knowledge, it maybe expected that an increasing number of hereditary conditions will bebrought into this category, and thus the load of suffering from illness of thiskind be reduced. It should be realised, however, that the preservation ofthose afflicted by hereditary conditions will increase their chances of havingchildren and so lead to an increased prevalence of the condition in thepopulation and with it an increased need for medical services.156. From the point of view of the long-term effects on the population, itmust be remembered that, even though most of the new recessive allelesproduced by an increase of mutation rates will not meet a like partner inthe first generation after they are produced, and will therefore remain con-concealed, they will still exist in the population. They will in fact persist until,at some later time, two carriers of like genes happen to mate. The recessiveeffects will then become manifest in some of the children of such matings. Ifsuch genes are harmful, these affected children will produce fewer offspringthan the normal, so that there will be a reduced chance that the genes willbe passed on to later generations. In this way newly mutated genes caneventually die out. The extinction of the gene will have been brought about,however, only by the failure of some affected individual or individuals to reproduce at the normal rate, a circumstance which may sometimes be merelyunfortunate but in other cases may be the expression of a hereditary defectwhich causes great suffering. Thus, if the mutation rate is increased, and acrop of newly mutated recessive genes produced, they will continue to causeharmful effects for many generations.. The Effects of Increased Mutation Rates on Hereditary Traits showingContinuous Variation about the Normal157. Although in any human population we can find individuals who arephysically, biochemically or mentally abnormal in a relatively gross way and whose abnormality can be traced to single gene differences, most of the variation between human beings is not in fact of this kind. Even in that greater part of the population which we should describe as normal, no twoindividuals, are alike: they vary by imperceptible gradations over a wide range in respect of many characters such as physique, general well being,life span, intelligence and so on. Some of the variation is hereditary but someis due to differences in environment or in the circumstances under which theindividual lives and has grown up. The hereditary portion of this variationis believed to be due to the combined action of many genes which supplementone another in producing their effects. These genes cannot be distinguishedone from another, and their effects have therefore to be measured in a waydiffering from that used where a gene has consequences sufficiently drasticfor it to be followed as a separate entity. The importance of heredity insuch cases is expressed by estimating the proportion of the variation whichis traceable to gene effects. The properties of the system of genes are inferredfrom observations on the amount of this variation which is shared by relativesand on the change in the proportion from generation to generation. Inparticular, the effect of mutation will be measured by the increment it addsto the variation in each generation.
158. One difficulty should be observed at the outset. The success of this method of approach depends on the ability to measure separately the propor-tions of the variation attributable to the combined effects of the genes, andthe proportion attributable to environmental factors external to the individual.Even in animals and plants, under the conditions of controlled experiment,this is not always easy. In man, whose parents give him not only his genesbut also the home and environment in which his early and most forma-tive years are passed, the separation of hereditary and environmental effectsis always extremely difficult. Observations on, for example, children brought up by foster parents are of some assistance ; but, even so, the conclusionsat which we have been able to arrive must be regarded as rough estimates and treated with due caution.159. Genetic theory leads us to expect that, since mutation brings newgene differences into the population, the basic effect of an increase in themutation rate will be to increase the variation shown by these characters,that is to raise the numbers of the more extreme types at the expense ofthe more central, average individuals. Very little information is available,however, even from experimental animals and plants, about the magnitude ofthe effect to be expected. Such few observations as we have (Appendix F)suggest that in any generation the variation due to new mutation is but asmall fraction of the heritable variation observable, and, of course, a $tillsmaller fraction of the total variation, which includes that due to the environment. Indeed, the available data would lead us to expect that hundreds of generations of mutation would be needed to build up the variation wi&apos;ichis seen in a human population. A doubling of the mutation rate for a fewgenerations would therefore be expected to have only the most trivial effecton the variation in such characters, and even a persisting doubling of themutation rate would take very many generations to approach its full effect,which at most would be to double the variation.&apos; The distribution of intelligence160. The effect on the distribution of intelligence or, more accurately,on the score in intelligence tests of an increase in the hereditary variation,such as would be expected to result from a raised mutation rate, is con-sidered in Appendix G. Extensive studies have been made of the intelligencescore and something is known about its distribution in the population andthe extent to which it is inherited. Increase in the variation, that is in the spread of the distribution, will lead to an increase in the numbers both with markedly low and markedly high scores. Furthermore, the more extreme the class under consideration, the greater the increase in itsnumbers relative to the overall change in the variation. Thus, from the table in Appendix G, it will be seen that a doubling of the heritablevariation could lead in the long run to nearly a tripling of the numbersfalling short of an intelligence score of 70 and conventionally regarded as requiring special schooling. On the assumption that the average score did not fall, a corresponding increase would be expected in those with the highscores of over 130.161. The increase in the two extremes of the distribution may, however,not be symmetrical. Evidence from experimental organisms shows that,where a character has been subjected in the past to much selection in aparticular direction, new variation is likely to produce a disproportionatelylarge increase of the more extreme types in the direction opposite to thattowards which selection has been pushing the character. This would still be true when the variation is being increased toy irradiation. It seems probable,in the light of man&apos;s evolutionary history, that he has been subjected to fairly
intense natural selection for increased intelligence. It might therefore beexpected that an increase in the variation, resulting from a raised mutationrate, while leading to some increase in the fraction of those who are highlyintelligent, would lead to a greater perhaps much greater increase in theother extreme fraction with low intelligence. In addition to the calculationwhich assumes that the average intelligence score remains constant and soassumes symmetrical increases at the two ends of the distribution, AppendixG includes a calculation which assumes an asymmetrical effect, the overall average of the population falling but the proportion of children ofgrammar school ability remaining constant. The disproportion in the increaseof the low end of the distribution is of course increased, a doubling of the variation raising the proportion with a score of less than 70, perhaps by asmuch as four or five times. It should be remembered, however, that these calculations apply to the situation when the increase in variation has reached its full extent. We have already seen that such data as are availablesuggest that a permanent increase in the mutation rate would take hundreds ofgenerations to produce its full effects on hereditary variation.Observations on Populations exposed to Radiation162. An alternative approach to the problem before us, and one whichin addition might provide direct evidence of the relation between the doseof radiation and increased incidence of hereditary traits in man, is to observe the effects on human populations which have been exposed to ionizingradiations. Three such studies have been carried out, two on American radio-logists and the other on the Japanese populations who were in Hiroshimaand Nagasaki at the time of the atomic bomb explosions. For various reasons,the evidence from each is inconclusive, even that from the extensive studyby the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission in Japan.Possible indicators of change in mutation rates163. Among the possible indicators of a change in the mutation rateare a change in the sex ratio at birth, the congenital malformation rate, thestillbirth rate, the neonatal death rate, the weight at birth, the weight at nine months, and measurements of the head and body. Changes in the sex ratio maybe used as an indicator of genetic damage. The inheritance of abnormal genesin the sex chromosomes has been considered in relation to haemophilia.Experimental observations have shown that abnormal genes which killthe infant long before birth can be carried on the sex chromosomes and thereis reason to believe that this may be true in man. Such genes will necessarily disturb the sex ratio at birth ; mothers with such mutations willhave too few sons, and, in rare cases, fathers too few daughters.164. It is known, from both human and experimental evidence, that genescan produce abnormalities which are evident at birth. Estimates of the con-genital abnormality rate vary with different observers from just over one percent to about six per cent, owing to lack of agreement on what shall be reckoned an abnormality as well as to real differences in populations withrespect both to their environments and to the frequencies of the causal genes.Further, genes are not the only cause of such abnormal conditions. Bothclinical and experimental evidence suggests that maternal ill health, par-ticularly infectious disease and malnutrition during pregnancy, can producethem. There is no definite information as to what proportion of cases ofmalformation should be attributed to the effects of single genes ; nor are the forms of inheritance understood.165. The stillbirth and neonatal death rates are also influenced by awiety of factors. The evidence that abnormal genes can play a part is based
partly upon experimental genetics and partly upon investigations of familyhistories. On the evidence available at the present time, it is difficult toestimate the extent of the part played by genetical causes.Genetic studies on radiologists166. The evidence provided by the studies of congenital abnormalities inthe offspring of American radiologists is inconclusive for two reasons. First,no measurements were made of the radiation doses which were receivedby the radiologists in the course of their work and it is virtually impossibleto deduce&quot; these in retrospect. Secondly, the data were obtained by postal questionnaire, to which only three-quarters of the radiologistsreplied and little over half the other specialists who were used as a controlgroup. Whether those who chose to answer were representative of the totalis open to question. As the magnitude of the effects observed was small (slightrises in the incidence of twinning, foetal death and congenital malforma-tion), one cannot exclude the possibility that the increases were due tostatistical bias in the data rather than to the radiation exposure, or alter-natively that statistical bias in the other direction may have partly concealed a somewhat larger increase than was observed.Studies on Japanese populations167. The Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission^ genetic study was muchmore extensive. An attempt was made to assess the prompt radiation dosereceived by each individual; and in each city those remote from the burstconstituted a control population with which to compare those close to it.More than 80,000 subsequent pregnancies were followed, and a third ofthe children were re-examined at nine months of age.168. The final report on the genetic programme of the Atomic BombCasualty Commission has not yet been published ; but through the courtesyof the United States authorities, and especially of Dr. James V. Neel and dr. William J. Schull, we received copies of the draft and are permitted to refer to it. The data present many difficulties of interpretation for several reasons. First, the radiation dose was not known with any accuracy. Second,the parents with different degrees of exposure were not entirely comparablein various characteristics, such as maternal age at birth of the child, towhich the congenital malformation rate is related ; for this reason, even ifthere were no effect due to exposure, the children of the highly exposedparents would be expected to differ in their congenital malformation ratefrom those of the slightly exposed. Complex statistical procedures are neces-sary to allow for this. Even more open to error is the comparison betweenthe children of exposed parents and those of parents who were entirelyunexposed. The latter group of parents included immigrants from other citiesor from rural areas after the time of the bombing, and some who were away from home at the time, and the effect of these factors on, say, the congenitalmalformation rate is quite unknown. Thirdly, the number of people whosurvived high exposures was not large and therefore there were comparativelyfew births in this group; estimates of the incidence of congenital malforma-tions and other abnormalities among them are consequently of low statisticalprecision, being open to relatively large disturbances through the operation ofchance. Fourthly, only small effects would be expected in any given generation,even if the mutation rate had been raised many times.169. Any opinion on a report which is still only in draft must be regardedas provisional. In our view, however, the data suggest an effect of the bombradiations on genetic factors in prenatal survival, as shown by the sex-ratio at birth. The evidence for this effect is not highly significant statistically
and any change which was induced in the sex-ratio is unlikely to haveexceeded 2 per cent per 100 r exposure of one parent. This appears to bethe only positive conclusion that might perhaps be drawn but it is possible,for several of the measurements, to set upper limits to the changes that mighthave occurred without being detected. From the nature of the evidence apossible doubling, but not more than doubling, of the congenital malforma-tion rate, or a 50 per cent rise in the stillbirth rate, following exposure of oneparent to 200 r, might have escaped detection.170. Although it was possible to set an upper limit to the - increase insex-ratio, congenital malformation rate and still-birth rate, we were unable todo so for the increase in mutation rates of the genes responsible. For thispurpose it would first be necessary to know what proportion of prenataldeath or malformation is in ordinary circumstances due to newly mutatedgenes and what proportion to genes already present in the population. Wecannot, therefore, derive from the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission^data any estimate of the mutation-rate-doubling radiation dose for man.The Radiation &apos; Doubling Dose&apos; for Human Mutation Rates.171. At this stage it becomes necessary for us to attempt to give aquantitative estimate of the magnitude of the effect of any given dose ofirradiation on the mutation rate in human populations. This is an extremelydifficult task, since not only have we as yet too little precise information on which to base an accurate estimate, but also it is by no means simpleto know in what terms the effect should best be measured.172. We have seen that all genes mutate spontaneously. The spontaneousmutation rate (s) of any particular gene can be considered to be made upof two parts ; some of its mutations (x) will be provoked by the naturallyoccurring radiation, while others (y) will be due to other influences, sothat s = x + y. It would be easy to find a theoretically adequate measureof the effect of increased radiation on mutation, if all mutations were causedby radiation of some kind, y would then be zero ; and, since we have seen (paragraph 130) that radiation-induced mutations increase in simple pro-portion to the amount of radiation, it follows that, if the amount of radiationwere doubled, the mutation rate would be doubled also, and so on. We couldexpress the effect of increased radiation in the terms of the &apos; doubling dose&apos;,that is the quantity of radiation required to double the spontaneous mutationrate. It is clear that the doubling dose under these circumstances would be equal to the naturally occurring radiation.173. However, as we shall see later (paragraph 178), there is good evidencethat in the few well-studied animals spontaneous mutations are not due solely to radiation, and therefore we cannot safely assume that y is zero. Thesituation would remain fairly simple, provided x and y were always inthe same proportion, so that we could assume that a certain constant fraction of the spontaneous mutations of each gene is caused by natural radiation ;but this also seems unlikely to be the case. Older parents have accumulatedhigher doses of radiation than younger parents ; if all genes were equallysensitive to radiation, the frequency of all new mutations should then show the same increase in the children of older fathers as in the children of oldermothers. It is found, however, that for some human genes, but not for others,the increase is more marked in children of old fathers than in those of oldmothers. This fact suggests that the genes which exhibit this relationship topaternal age differ from other genes in that their mutation is dependent inan important way on something other than radiation, perhaps on the number
of cell divisions since conception, which is much greater for sperm than for eggs. There is also some evidence from experiments on flies, and otherorganisms, in which high doses of radiation were employed, that certaingenes are more radiation-sensitive than others. In view of these facts, it isonly safe to assume that the same may be true of human genes, and thatfor each gene the spontaneous mutation rate is built up of both an x anda y fraction, which do not always bear the same proportionate relation to each other.174. If this is so, an amount of extra radiation which will double themutation rate of the most radiation-sensitive genes will have a much smallereffect on the more radiation-tolerant ones. It is then impossible to give anyone figure which will measure the effect of radiation on the whole set ofgenes. However, in practice we still know so little about human mutationrates that we can, provisionally, make some simplification of the theoreticalconsiderations. We can attempt to assess the effects of increased radiation interms of that dose of radiation which will double the spontaneous mutationrate of an adequate and representative sample of the most sensitive genes.This would be a minimum estimate of the doubling dose. By &quot; adequate and representative&quot; we mean that we must consider a sufficient numberof the more sensitive genes to get examples of all the different kinds ofgenetic effects. Fortunately there is no reason to doubt that, if one con-sidered a fairly large number of the most radiation-sensitive genes, theywould contain examples of genes with all possible kinds of effect. We shallassume that this is indeed so, and, further, that there are sufficient genes withroughly the same degree of radiation-sensitivity for us to employ the concept of a representative doubling dose of radiation of the kind whichwe have been discussing.175. The attempt to estimate a figure for the minimum representativedoubling dose in man is best with many difficulties. We have as yet no usefuldirect evidence. The only data which might provide information aboutactual increases in human mutation following irradiation are those from the investigations of the results of the atomic bombs in Japan, and those on theoffspring of radiologists, and, as we have already seen (paragraphs 162-170),in neither case is the material sufficient to lead to any firm conclusions. Atthe present time, therefore, we are driven to&apos; making indirect estimates.176. Perhaps the most firmly based line of argument towards an indirectestimate is one which leads us to an assessment of a minimum figure above which the doubling dose must almost certainly lie. Let us suppose that allhuman spontaneous mutations are radiation-induced; then, provided themutation rate increases in direct proportion to the radiation, the doublingdose would be the same as the quantity of natural radiation received. Theonly way of escape from this argument would be by the supposition that for human genes the mutation rate is not directly proportional to the radiation,but that they are comparatively insensitive to small doses up to the level of natural radiation, and relatively much more sensitive to doses slightlygreater than this. There is no evidence in any other animal for such an effect, but a few experiments in plants the results of which are not entirelyconsistent have suggested an effect of this kind, though only a slight one.It therefore seems safe to argue that, even under the most pessimistic assump-tion that all human spontaneous mutations are induced by radiation, the doubling dose could not be appreciably less than the normal amount of natural radiation. It will be seen, in the chapter on exposure levels, thati&apos;n this country, over a period of 30 years this amounts to about 3 r to thereproductive organs. We may therefore take this figure as the lower limit of our estimate.
177. The next step is to try to determine whether the actual value of the doubling dose is quite near this limit or considerably above it. There are several ways in which we can proceed. We may first ask whether theJapanese data are compatible with a doubling dose as low as 3 r, orwhether, if the value were as low as that, one would have to anticipaterather striking effects in place of the almost complete absence of definitelysignificant results which was actually observed. Calculations show that, if some more or less plausible assumptions are made, the absence of definitelyrecognisable effects in the Japanese data does not contradict a doublingdose as low as 3 r, although it is of course more easily accounted for, ifthe real doubling dose is considerably higher.178. Our lower limit for the doubling dose was based on the suppositionthat all spontaneous human mutations are caused by radiation. If naturalradiation accounts for something less than 100 per cent of spontaneousmutations, then this lower limit would be raised accordingly. In experimentalanimals, one can determine what fraction of spontaneous mutation isdue to radiation by measuring the effects of several different large radiationdoses and extrapolating the results to the naturally occurring dose. Evenamong experimental animals, it is only for fruit flies that we yet have sufficient information to do this with much confidence. It turns out in this case that natural radiation accounts for only about one ten thousandth(0 0001) of their spontaneous mutations. In trying to extend this result toman, we have to take into account two considerations. The first is that the longer the time elapsing between the conception of an individual and hisreproducing, the greater the dose of radiation he will accumulate. The second is that, if the genes are equally radiation-sensitive in two species, the fraction of the spontaneous mutation induced by natural radiation will be smaller ifthe spontaneous rate is large than it would be were the spontaneous ratesmall. If one compares the lengths of the pre-reproductive periods of man and flies one finds that man has time to accumulate about 1,000 times as muchradiation as the fly. We are much less certain about the comparison of theirspontaneous mutation rates, since figures for man are not available for manyloci (Appendix C). However, estimates have been made that the humanmutation rate is not less than five times as great as that in flies. We should then find that the fraction of the human spontaneous rate due to radiation canbe estimated at 1,000/5 times the fraction which holds for flies, i.e. 200 x0-0001, or about 2 per cent.179. The argument given above is based on the hypothesis that the sensi-tivity of human genes to radiation, that is the mutation rate induced perroentgen, is the same as it is in flies. As has been repeatedly pointed out, wehave no definite evidence about the radiation-sensitivity of human genes,by which this assumption could be checked. The mouse is the only mammalfor which we have any evidence on the radiation-sensitivity of genes. Theinduced mutation rates for a small number of genes have been roughlymeasured for this species. The experiments suggest that its genes are about ten times as sensitive as fly genes; but it should toe noted that this figuredepends very largely on only one of the seven genes tested. However, inorder to be cautious we may make the hypothesis that mouse genes areten times as sensitive as fly genes, and that human genes are similar tomouse genes. According to this hypothesis, we must increase our estimateof the fraction of human spontaneous mutation rate due to radiation by tentimes, from 2 per cent to 20 per cent.180. According as we suppose the radiation-induced fraction of thespontaneous mutation rate of man to be 20 per cent or 2 per cent, we arrive
-    sat  estimates for the doubling dose that are five or fifty times the naturallyoccurring radiation, that is 15 r or 150 r. It must ibe pointed out, however,that the calculations which have just been given have involved a numberof quantities which are still only imperfectly known ; for- instance, the spon-taneous mutation rates of flies, mice and particularly men. One cannot therefore, on this basis, absolutely exclude the possibility that the doublingdose may actually lie somewhat below 15 r. -181. Various other theoretical methods have been suggested for utilising the data about experimental animals to calculate a doubling dose for man.They all lead to values within the same rather wide range as we have justreached. Moreover, they all involve even more conjecture about quantitieson which we. have little precise information, such as the comparativenumbers of gene-loci in man and other animals. We shall not attempt to summarise them here..   -182. There is another rather different type of approach to the problem, thatis to compare the values of the minimum representative doubling dose inthe animals and plants for which we have the most reliable data (AppendixH). They mostly run from about 25 r upwards, many of them being between25 and 60 r. Only a few types of organisms have yet been studied indetail, but taken as it stands this evidence would suggest that all doublingdoses lie in about the same range, and it is therefore possible that man&apos;s may do so too. It is unfortunate, though easily understandable, that none ofthe fully investigated organisms has a lifetime comparable in length to thatof man, and this suggests the necessity of caution in applying the results to man. But one might expect, a priori, that evolutionary processes wouldhave acted to reduce the radiation sensitivity of the genes of organisms withlong pre-reproductive periods, so that they would have higher doublingdoses. Thus, this line of approach would lead us to expect the human doublingdose to lie above 25 r.183. The discussion in the last few paragraphs has been given at some length in order to bring out the great uncertainty of our present knowledgeof the doubling dose for most human genes. Mustering all the argumentsat our disposal, we can only come to the conclusion that it almost certainlylies above 3 r, but that it may be as much as 150 r or even more. any statement which goes beyond this can only be phrased in terms of probabili-ties, and depends on a judgment made by balancing all the different linesof argument against one another. In this tentative fashion, we should advance the view that there is little likelihood that the representative value liesbetween 3 r and 15 r ; and that, although we cannot exclude the possibility that for some human genes the doubling dose may be less than 30 r and for others more than 80 r, the best estimate which we can make, in the lightof present knowledge, is that the representative value lies between 30 rand 80 r.184. It remains to consider what dangers would arise if we have, for lackof adequate information, materially over-estimated the value of the doublingdose for human genes. Even if we suppose that it is actually as low as theminimum that we can reasonably entertain, namely 15 r, it is extremely im-probable that in times of peace the whole population, or a large fraction of it,will receive an additional dose of this magnitude from industrial or other sources. We need not therefore anticipate any general danger. There may,however, be small groups of people, for instance, those employed in certainindustrial processes or receiving medical treatment involving X-rays, who may be exposed to doses near the representative doubling dose. Have theygrounds for fearing any disastrous effects on their descendants? In the first32066 A 14
place, it is obvious that if, for reasons of age or other considerations, they donot reproduce after the period of exposure, no genetic effects at all willeventuate. If they do reproduce, there are two aspects to be considered: their immediate offspring and later descendants.185. We shall consider first the immediate descendants. It has been calculated on theoretical grounds that at the present time, without any additional radiation, approximately one human germ cell in ten (10 per cent)carries a new mutation. The great majority of these are recessive, and only very rarely have an effect on immediate offspring. Probably not morethan one in a hundred is a dominant, the action of which will beseen in the next generation. Thus, a doubling of the mutation rate might lead to an increase of one in a thousand (0 1 per cent) in the numbersof harmfully-affected children in the next generation. This must be comparedwith the present chance that the children born in a family will be con-genitally defective. At present, about four per cent of all babies are stillbornor die shortly after birth, while another two per cent survive but aremalformed ; and in addition a considerable number in later years developdiseases or abnormalities in which hereditary constitution is a preponderatingcause. Thus a doubling of the mutation rate in one parent would only add to the chance of producing a defective child an additional 0&apos;1 per cent,above the present level of about seven to eight per cent.186. A more realistic estimate of individual genetical risk can be obtainedfrom the figures given in paragraphs 141 to 150. For example, the ordinaryrisk that any pair of parents will produce an imbecile or an idiot thatis a case of severe mental defect which survives, is about one in 500. Theincreased proportional risk for parents in both of whom mutation rates havebeen doubled is three per cent; this means that the risk of their having a child with severe mental defect which survives is one in 485. If only oneparent is affected, the risk would be increased by a factor of 15 per cent sothat the chance would then be about one in 493. Similarly, the risk of producing psychotic offspring might be increased by a factor of one per cent.The likelihood of miscarriage, still-birth, or foetal malformation wouldprobably be even less increased; compared with the changes in incidencewhich occur, for example, at different maternal ages or between the first and later births, these alterations would be inappreciable. The risks ofoccurrence of specific dominant or sex-linked traits, such as those listed inthe table of human mutation rates (Appendix C), would indeed be pro-disproportionately much more markedly affected; but, because of their raritythe risks of these abnormalities are ordinarily considered negligible for theindividual and, even after being nearly doubled, they would remain so.187. In ordinary circumstances if a parent carries any given allele, the chance that one of his offspring receives it is one in two ; a grandchildhas one chance in four of receiving it and a great-grandchild has one chancein eight. The same rule applies to an allele which has arisen by freshmutation in the parent. Thus it follows that the extra risk of disability, which applies to the children of an individual who has been exposed to dosesof radiation causing mutation, will be halved in each subsequent generation of his offspring provided that the level of mutation rate in the rest of thepopulation has not also been raised. Moreover, it must be rememberedthat under natural conditions every human being already carries a certainnumber of harmful recessive genes, the results of spontaneous mutationin the past. There is therefore no reason v/hy an individual in whomthe mutation rate has been doubled, or increased by some similar figure,need fear that he runs an appreciable risk of founding a &quot; bad line &quot; ofdescendants.
32066A 15188. One may conclude that, if a relatively small group of prospectiveparents receives a doubling dose of radiation, no noticeable effects will beproduced either on their immediate offspring or upon their descendants. Forlevels of radiation up to the doubling dose, and even some way beyond,the genetic effects of radiation are only appreciable when reckoned overthe population as a whole and need cause no alarm to the individual on hisown account.
EXISTING AND FORESEEABLE LEVELS OF EXPOSURETO RADIATIONIntroduction189. Throughout the whole of his evolutionary history, man like all livingorganisms has been exposed to small but variable amounts of ionizingradiation from his natural surroundings. To these he has now added similarradiations from his own inventions. In their biological action these differ but little from each other, and all must be taken into account when assessing thepresent hazards from ionizing radiation. We shall first consider thoseinescapable radiations which come from the natural background and, there-after, those which are derived from sources controllable by man.190. It will be clear from an earlier chapter of this report that relativelyheavy doses of radiation are required to impair the health ofthe individual and such doses are rarely associated with the ordinarycircumstances of civilian life. The use of radiation for medical purposesor exposure to occupational sources of radiation may be associated with thepossibility of high doses, but every precaution is taken to safeguard the patient and the employee is protected by nationally and internationallyrecognised recommendations which limit the doses received occupationallyto levels considered to be safe.191. On the other hand, our knowledge of the genetic effects of radiationis less precise and it is believed that doses of radiation which have no knowneffects on the health of the individual may be of genetic consequence. Dosesreceived from all sources, however small, have therefore to be assessed inthe light of their possible genetic implications. It has been seen that ionizingradiation can have genetic consequences only in so far as it affects thereproductive organs-the gonads and it is thus the dose received by thegonads up to the end of reproductive life which must be estimated in allcases. At the levels of dose with which we are mainly concerned, the geneticeffects of radiation can be calculated only in relation to the population as awhole. It is therefore in terms of the total gonad dose1 to the popula-tion that the following estimates of the exposures from various sources havebeen made.Radiation from Natural SourcesCosmic radiation192. Cosmic radiation reaches the earth from interstellar space. The atmo-sphere surrounding the earth has substance and acts as a filter, absorbingalmost all the dose to which otherwise we should be exposed. In general,the longer their path through the atmosphere, the more the radiations willbe attenuated ; thus, the dose at sea level is less than that at high altitudes.1 The total genetically effective gonad dose to a population is found by summing, over allindividuals in the population, the product of the accumulated gonad dose since conceptionand the probable number of children to be conceived during the year.
193. Cosmic radiation has several components protons,2 fast and slowmesons,3 electrons4 and neutrons5 which differ in their relative contributionto the natural background of radiation according to the altitude ; at sealevel the most important are mesons, electrons and neutrons. Mesons andelectrons are considered to be, for equal physical doses, of about the samebiological effectiveness as gamma rays. Fast neutrons and protons of highenergy may be several times more damaging to the individual but are less likely to induce gene mutation. Neglecting this possible variation in effective-ness and assuming equal biological efficiency for all the particles, onederives a dose at sea level equivalent to 0-028 r per annum from cosmic radia-tion. Virtually all of this is highly penetrating radiation and can be assumed to irradiate the whole body, including the gonads, almost uniformly.Terrestrial radiation194. A&quot; few of the naturally occurring elements, particularly the heavyelements, are radioactive, thorium and uranium being the chief primarysources. These two elements are only feebly radioactive and each has a half-life measured in many millions of years, Each atom, in its radioactivedisintegration, is transmuted to a daughter atom which is also radioactiveand which in turn disintegrates to another radioactive atom, the processbeing continued until ultimately a non-radioactive stable atom of lead is formed. All the daughter elements decay much more rapidly than the originalparents, thorium and uranium, and many of them emit gamma rays as wellas nuclear particles in their disintegration.195. Thorium and uranium are almost universally distributed in tracequantities in rocks and soils, areas of granitic rock usually having higherconcentrations than sedimentary rock. Occasionally, the concentration is considerably greater than normal, sufficient to make the area worth mining,but even in these rich lodes it is usually only of the order of one per centor less.196. As a consequence of the presence in many soils of the radioactivedaughter products of uranium and thorium, emission of gamma rays occurswidely over the land surfaces of the earth. Brick and stone necessarily con-tain traces of these radioactive substances and, inside houses built of suchmaterials, radiation is added from this source. On the other hand, substantialstructures of brick and stone offer slight shielding from cosmic radiation.197. The amount of radiation contributed from the earth and from build -ings varies from place to place even in the same country and any average figure can be only an approximation, but 0-078 r per year would perhaps be representative of the amount received inside buildings on the surface ofthe body by the inhabitants of this country. The corresponding figure in the open would perhaps be 0-048 r per year. Measurements show that about 37per cent, of the dose of gamma rays is absorbed superficially and filtered offbefore reaching the internal tissues and organs: allowing for this and esti-2 Protons are nuclei of hydrogen atoms and carry a unit positive charge. Fast movingprotons are a minor component of cosmic rays at ground level. Neutron radiation alsogives rise to protons in traversing hydrogenous material.3 Mesons are unstable particles with masses intermediate between those of electrons andprotons. Energetic mesons constitute the main component of the more penetrating cosmicrays.4 Electrons are the smallest constituent particles of atoms. The electron carries the elementary negative charge of electricity. It has a positively-charged counterpart of equalmass called the positron. The soft or less penetrating component of cosmic rays consistsessentially of positrons and electrons and about an equal number of gamma rays.5 Neutrons see Chapter II, paragraph 19.32066 A16
mating the amount of time that a person spends in the open, the averagedose at the gonads of persons in this country from external gamma radiationis estimated to be 0-043 r per year.Atmospheric radon198. One of the decay-products of uranium is radon, a gas which diffusesout of the earth and buildings and from minerals such as coal. In general,its concentration in the atmosphere is extremely low, about 0-3 of a micro-miorocurie* per litre of air, but in cities such as London, where much coalis burnt, it may sometimes reach ten times this amount. In these circumstances,the dose of gamma rays from the further disintegration-products of radon mayalmost equal the dose of radiation from cosmic sources. The average doseto the gonads from this source, however, probably does not exceed 0-001 rper year from the atmosphere and an approximately equal or slightly greateramount from the gas absorbed into the body from the lungs.Radioactive constituents of the body199. Among the normal constituents of the body are the elements carbon andpotassium, each of which has a radioactive isotope occurring naturally as a minute fraction of the total element. The radioactive isotope potassium 40forms 1 / 8000 of natural potassium and emits both beta particles and gammarays. An average value for the potassium content of the body is 0-21 percent by weight, and measurements suggest that the figure for the gonadsdoes not differ greatly. Calculation on this basis gives an estimated doseto the gonads of about 0-02 r per year. Naturally occurring radioactivecarbon, carbon 14 constitutes one part in a million millions (1012) of naturalcarbon ; it emits only beta particles. Taking body, tissue to be 18 per centcarbon, one derives a dose from this source of about 0-001 r per annumto the gonads.Total gonad dose from natural sources200. Information on the total dose to the gonads from natural sources of radiation is summarised in Table 2. It will be seen that, from all sources,the total is roughly 0-J r per annum or about 3 r per generation of 30 years.(See Appendix J.)TABLE 2Estimated dose rates to gonads from natural sources of radiationRadiation sourceEstimated average doserate to gonads in roentgensper yearExternal radiationCosmic rays (sea levei)Gamma rays from the earth ...Radon in air    .........0-0280-0430-001Internal radiation&quot;Potassium     ......&quot;Carbon        ......Radon and decay products0-0200-0010-002Total0-0951,000,000,000,000of a curie.

Since the discovery of X-rays and radioactive materials man hasadopted them increasingly for certain of his needs. In medicine they nowprovide invaluable, and often irreplaceable, aids to diagnosis and treatment.They are now used extensively in industry and in the amenities of moderncivilised life. It is necessary, therefore, to assess the dose that these develop-ments contribute above that received from the natural surroundings.Diagnostic X-rays203. For some time it has been realised that by far the largest contribution is made by diagnostic X-rays. Continuing efforts are therefore being madeto assess the dose of radiation given to the whole population in this way.The problem of accurate assessment is beset with difficulties and at presentany estimate must be based upon very imperfect data. The two basic require-ments and the best means of fulfilling them from available figures are asfollows:(i) The number of radiological examinations made annually subdividedby the sex and age of the persons examined and by the part of the body under examination. It is possible to make from published figuresa reasonable estimate of the total number of X-ray examinations made within the National Health Service. A minimum figure for the year1955 would be 12,200,000. To this must be added an unknown butrelatively small number for hospitals outside the National health service and for private practice. This number has been estimated atrather less than half a million, giving a total of 12,650,000.The division of this very large figure into sex, age and type ofradiological  examination  has  been  made  on  the  basis  of  in-formation  supplied  by   five hospitals  only   and  covering  some32066 A 17Radioactivity in bone201. Within the body, radioactivity is probably highest in bone. Thenaturally occurring radioactive heavy elements are contaminants of food and water as well as of soil and they and their disintegration products, of whichradium is the most important biologically, are absorbed to a very limited extent from the gut. The body removes them from the circulation and storesthem in bone. In this way the radioactivity of bone builds up graduallythroughout life but there is no evidence that the rather higher doses in bonecompared with other tissues is deleterious. Table 3 gives the estimated dosesto bone from these sources.TABLE 3
21,000 patients (two London teaching hospitals and three others).While there are certainly differences between these hospitals, theyare not so wide as to make an approximate calculation unwarranted.The sample has therefore been accepted as representative.A very important source of radiation to the gonads is provided byradiological pelvimetry, which measures the size of the pelvic outletof the woman in relation to the actual or potential size of her infant;a second important source is X-ray examination of the abdomen inpregnancy. Information of the frequency with which such examinationsare made has therefore been specially sought from a rather widergroup of nine hospitals. On the assumption that these are representa-tive, the results have been applied to all live births occurring in hospitals in England and Wales.In addition to the 12,650,000 X-ray examinations already mentioned;certain others are undertaken for special reasons and these bring theestimated total during 1955 up to nearly 18,000,000. The additionalexaminations include mass miniature radiography, dental radiography,examinations of service personnel and mineworkers, but each of thesetypes of examination represents a relatively unimportant source of radiation to the gonads and the effect of any error in estimating their contribution will be slight in relation to the total.(ii) The average dose to the gonads male, female and foetal separately produced by the diagnostic irradiation of each separate part of the body. For the purposes of calculation the figures used, which coverX-ray examinations of 24 different parts of the body, have been derivedalmost entirely from one London teaching hospital where carefulmeasurements have been made and precautions taken to restrict theirradiation of ithe gonads to the lowest possible level. They are there-fore almost certain to be minimum figures. It should be realised that with the X-ray tube only slightly misaligned the dose may some-times be multiplied many times.204. Bringing together these two sets of figures the estimated numbers and ages of persons irradiated and the estimated average gonad dose delivered to them with specified examinations leads to two important general con-clusions. It shows, first, that almost the whole population dose is accountedfor by a relatively few sites of examination, principally the hip, the lumbarspine, the lower abdomen and the pelvis. The far more frequent examinationsof chest, head and limbs make relatively unimportant contributions.Secondly, according to the present calculations, the amount of radiationreaching the reproductive organs of the people of this country throughdiagnostic radiology is as much as 22 per cent of that derived from naturalsources. Indeed, in view of the minimum figures adopted in these calculations,the contribution of diagnostic radiology may well be very considerably higherthan 25 per cent. It undoubtedly forms the most important source of man-made irradiation and its application has been steadily increasing in recentyears (Appendix K).Radiotherapy205. At present there is little information about the contribution to thepopulation dose from therapeutic irradiation. Although its main use is for patients with malignant disease, the majority of whom are beyond the child-bearing age, some younger patients are treated for non-malignant conditionssuch as ankylosing spondylitis. Less penetrating X-rays are widely used inthe treatment of a large number of diseases of the skin, and the artificially
produced radioactive element iodine 131 is now being administered forhyperthyroidism.206. It is as yet not possible to state a figure for the population doseto the gonads from this source of radiation. Rough assessments would suggestthat it is considerably less than the dose from diagnostic radiology but probably greater than that from any other source. The problem is one uponwhich research is required.X-ray fluoroscopy for shoe-fitting207. X-rays are used commercially for fitting shoes but, with modern equipment and good practice, it appears that the number of machines inoperation would probably deliver not more than 0T per cent of the doseto the gonads received from natural radiation.Luminous watches and clocks208. Watches and clocks with luminous dials depend for their luminosityupon the rays from radium or other radioactive material used in the paint.Measurements and calculations suggest that the average wrist watch containsabout one-fifth of a microcurie of radium. A calculated dose to the gonadsfrom the wearing of such a watch is about 0-01 r per year.209. From the information given by the trade, it can be deduced thatthere are in use about three million men&apos;s watches and about a millionwomen&apos;s and children&apos;s watches with luminous dials. In addition, there maybe about ten million luminous alarm clocks. On this basis it can be estimatedthat the population dose from this source is about one per cent of the naturalbackground.Television sets210. Cathode-ray tubes for television sets are capable of causing theproduction of X-rays. In general, however, the operating voltages are com-paratively low and the X-rays are readily absorbed by the walls of the tubesand by protective screens. It can be estimated that the population-dose fromthis source is at present much less than one per cent of the dose receivedfrom natural radiation.Cosmic radiation in aircraft211. Since the amount of radiation from cosmic sources is greater at high altitudes, the doses received by persons in aircraft have been investigatedand the population dose calculated. The additional dose averaged over thewhole population is at present insignificant compared with that received fromthe normal background.Occupational Exposure to RadiationMedical and industrial workers212. Men and women have been exposed to ionizing radiation in thecourse of their occupations for over half a century. In the early years afterthe discovery of X-rays and radioactive materials, many suffered injury butsafe practices have gradually been elaborated and standards of safety laiddown. In this country since 1921 the British X-ray and Radium ProtectionCommittee, and later the Medical Research Council Committee on protection against Ionizing Radiation, have considered the available information and made periodic recommendations on occupational exposure levels. Equivalentlevels have been advocated by the International Commission on RadiologicalProtection.
213. Control of radiation exposure may be effected in two ways. In thefirst, the intensity of radiation in the vicinity of the source is measured at frequent intervals and, provided that the intensities are always below thoselevels accepted by international agreement as being without danger, no separate check is required on the exposure of the individual. In the second,the doses actually received by the individual are recorded, usually by meansof a photographic film which he carries and which blackens on exposure toradiation, so allowing the dose received, if any, to be estimated. For twenty years the National Physical Laboratory has provided a service whereby suchfilms are issued on demand and subsequently read. The worker and hissupervisor can thus keep a check on the doses received to ensure that the accepted weekly levels of dose are not exceeded.214. The provision of film badges has now been taken over by the NationalRadiological Protection Service which serves the majority of people knownto be occupationally exposed, other than those employed by the atomic energy Authority or in the many hospital departments which process theirown films. The Service will be available to those employed in the many and increasingly varied industrial applications of ionizing radiation as well as to research laboratories.215. The records of this service have been sampled and analysed to assess the total dose from these sources to the population but, as precise recordsare not available from all branches of industry, the contributions from somesources are estimates only. It has not been possible to make as accuratean assessment as for the employees of the Atomic Energy Authority becausethe number, sex and ages of those exposed are not known with any precisionand the monitoring when carried out is not as complete.216. On the basis of figures from the hospitals which make use of this service, it has been roughly calculated that about 60 per cent of the medicalworkers at risk are women; in industry and research, women constituteonly 15 per cent. It is estimated that about 14,000 people are employed, ofwhom half are women. After allowance for the fact that in women radiationis more completely absorbed before it reaches the gonads, it was estimatedthat the average gonad dose for both men and women would be about-5 r per year. Because the ages are not known with precision, it is notpossible to make an accurate estimate of the genetic dose to the populationas a whole, but after making certain assumptions we have reached a figurefrom this source of 16 per cent of natural background radiation (AppendixAtomic Energy Authority employees111. The Atomic Energy Authority now employs about 7,000 people whoare exposed or potentially exposed to radiation in the course of their work.All employees liable to. be exposed wear film badges that are examinedweekly or monthly, and the sex and age of each individual are known.Thus it has been possible to calculate, with considerable accuracy, the dosesreceived by the employees in relation to their expectation of parenthood.The average dose to the Authority&apos;s employees from all occupational sources of radiation is 0&apos;4 r per year. The results of personnel monitoring show thatin all recent years no employee has had an average weekly exposure rateexceeding the maximum permissible and that about 90 per cent of the personsexposed to radiation averaged less than one-tenth of the maximum permissibleweekly rate. It has been estimated that the gonad dose averaged over thepopulation as a whole is about 0T per cent of the natural background.
-    215Contamination of the World by Fall-out from the Explosion of nuclear Weapons218. Except in the immediate vicinity of a nuclear weapon explosion, theionizing radiations to toe considered arise from radioactive particles. nuclear weapons differ in their construction and size and the same type of weaponcan be detonated in different ways under water, on land or in the air.These variations lead to differences in the radioactive dust produced, in itsdistribution and in the rate at which it falls out from the atmosphere on tothe earth.Radioactive fission products219. Radioactive fission products, formed when the atoms are split, becomemixed with the vapourised material from the bomb and with any earth, wateror debris caught up in the explosion. Large particles fall quickly and aredeposited close to the site of explosion ; small particles are carried up withthe hot gases to heights which vary with the power of the explosion. Theysubsequently travel in air streams for considerable distances and times,depending on the size of the particles and the height to which they were carried.220. The particles reaching this country from the distant explosion of a typical nuclear weapon detonated over land are spherical in shape and consist of fused silica and metallic oxides impregnated with fissionproducts. The vast majority are smaller than 0-001 of a centimeter indiameter. Particles from the thermonuclear tests in the Pacific atolls differ,in that they consist of calcium oxides or carbonates from coral and areirregular in shape. Both varieties are radioactive.221. Different types of weapon produce a similar mixture of fissionproducts in slightly different proportions but the over-all rate of decay ofradioactivity is almost the same in all types. The total radioactivity decays toone-tenth of the original level for each seven-fold increase of time in days, as measured from the moment of detonation ; thus, if the radioactivity is oneunit on the first day after detonation, it is 1 /10 unit at seven days, 1 /100unit at 49 days, and so on.222. At the time of atomic explosions some normally stable elements may become radioactive by virtue of the capture of neutrons. Such inducedactivities are for all practical purposes short-lived and therefore of little importance when long-term hazards are being considered.223. Since January 1951, continual watch has been kept by the atomic energy Authority on the radioactive fall-out reaching this country fromnuclear devices exploded in other parts of the world. The activity in rainwater at selected sites is recorded continuously. In addition the atmosphere is.sampled daily by the collection of dust on a cylindrical filter through which about 1,500 kilogrammes of air are passed, and the radioactivity of thefilter papers is determined (Appendix M).Radioactivity in air224. When the ordinary type of atomic bomb is exploded in Nevada, thedust-cloud rises to a height of about 40,000 feet. It then travels eastwardswith the winds which prevail at that height and diffuses both vertically andlaterally. It may or may not pass over this country on its first circuit round the world ; if it does so, it will usually appear about 5 days after the explosion. The cloud continues circling the earth, and peaks of activity canbe detected over any particular place in its path at about monthly intervals.The total radioactivity per unit volume of air falls progressively with time
owing to decay of the radioactive elements, to increased spread of the cloud and to deposition on the surface of the earth; approximately half theavailable material is deposited every 22 days.225. Clouds from thermonuclear explosions behave differently because ofthe far greater height, approximately 100,000 feet, to which the debris iscarried. Diffusion downwards from the stratosphere is a very slow process,and months after a thermonuclear test explosion most of the radioactivedebris is still at these great heights.226. Dust clouds from distant tests passing on the first circuit over thiscountry are usually too high to impart measurable activity to air at groundlevel. Subsequently, at the peak periods, concentrations are in the region offive radioactive disintegrations per minute per cubic metre (dpm/m3) of air.From April, 1952, to December, 1955, the mean concentration of activityfrom all bombs exploded in that period was 0-5 dpm/m3. The correspondingaverage activity from naturally occurring radon decay products in the airwas measured at one of the sampling stations and found to be 130 dpm/m3.The debris from the thermonuclear tests in the Pacific in 1954, much of it by now already decayed, has mostly still to come down, but it is not expected to exceed 0T dpm/m3 in the next few years. The dose to a personfully exposed to air with a radioactivity of 0-5 dpm/m3 has been calculated to be one millioneth of a roentgen per year.Deposited radioactivity227. The radoactivity fall-out is cleared, sooner or later, from the air bydeposition. Rain contains the bulk of deposited activity and continuingmeasurements have been made since 1951 of the radioactivity of rain watercollected from specially treated roofs. Any radioactive dust deposited on theroofs in spells of dry weather is washed off and included with the nextsample of rainwater. From these measurements the amount of radioactivitydeposited per square mile can be determined for each explosion.228. The dose that a man standing in the open in this country would receive from the deposition of radioactivity from all bombs so far explodedhas been estimated. It has been assumed that all the radioactivity remains onthe surface of the earth and that none is lost, as we know some will be, bydrainage and weathering. Including all ordinary atomic bombs explodedbefore December, 1955, and calculating all the radioactivity which they have contributed and will contribute over the next 50 years, it is found that thetotal dose which a man continuously out of doors, night and day, would receive is 0&apos;005 r. To this dose from ordinary atomic bombs must be added the dose from thermo-nuclear weapons. In the latter case the dose from theradioactivity still to be deposited is more important. It can be estimated thatthe accumulated dose from thermo-nuclear weapons is 0-002 to 0-003 r with another 0-027 r still to come.Total radioactivity from weapons already exploded229. All these doses together add up to about 0-035 r from weaponsalready exploded. This is a maximum dose. The loss of radioactivity fromweathering has not been taken into account, nor has the protection afforded by buildings in and around which most people in this country spend a large part of their lives. It would be realistic to divide the dose by three forweathering and by seven for protection afforded as a result of time spent inhouses. The average inhabitant of this country may therefore reecive in thenext 50 years between. 0-001 and 0-002 r. from this fall-out, or 0-02 to 0-04per cent of the radiation that he will receive during the same period fromnatural surroundings.
230. If the firing of both types of bomb were to continue indefinitely atthe same rate as over the past few years, there would be a build-up of activity gradually reaching a plateau in about a hundred years time which,on the same basis of calculation, would give the average individual a doseover a period of 30 years of 0-026 r or about 0-9 per cent of what he would receive in the same period from natural sources,231. The most impressive feature of these figures for exposure from fall-outis the very great effect of a very few thermonuclear explosions. This is not surprising since their power is measured in equivalents of millions of tonsof TNT compared with the thousands of tons for atomic bombs. If therate of firing this type of weapon increases, the radiation exposure will be altered proportionally.SPECIAL HAZARDS FROM RADIOACTIVE FISSION PRODUCTSParticulate contamination232. The total radioactivity in the air from fall-out is measured daily, anddeterminations are made of selected individual radioactive substances. the activity will arise from particles which may be inhaled into the lung. It canbe calculated, however, that not more than one or two particles of the more highly active substances are breathed by any person in the course of a year(Appendix dvl). Although the radioactivity of these particles is minute, it is concentrated in a few million millionths of a cubic centimetre (10-12 c.c.)and the possibility of their creating a hazard must therefore be considered.The International Commission on Radiological Protection has concluded thatthe critical volume of tissue to be taken into account is of the order of onecubic centimetre, which is a larger volume than could be heavily irradiatedby a few such radioactive particles. It seems unlikely that particulate con-decontamination  of the air from the fall-out from test-explosions would constitute a problem in ordinary civilian life.233. Radioactive material from the air deposits and accumulates on theground where it may contaminate drinking water and agricultural crops.After deposition it becomes possible to make routine measurements of thepresent concentration of the more dangerous radioactive substances. by december, 1955, this concentration amounted to 0-011 curie of strontium 90and 0-0002 curie of plutonium 239 per square mile. The continuing fall-out from explosions which have already taken place will cause a rise, to amaximum by about 1965, of around 0-045 curie of strontium 90 per squaremile. These figures should be viewed against the background of the factthat the top one foot of soil has always contained on the average about one curie per square mile of the equally, if not more, dangerous naturallyoccurring radium.Strontium 90234. From the point of view of general contamination of the world, thehazard from deposited strontium 90 might, according to present ideas, be greater than that from external radiation, since strontium, like radium, isordinarily retained in the body and deposited in bone. The average concen-tration of radioactive strontium in rain water over a period of three years ending December, 1955, was 17 micro-micro-curies per litre, and since mostwater passes through soil before being drunk, the activity reaching human beings through drinking water is extremely small.235. Strontium 90 is deposited on herbage and soil and is then absorbed into plants. Man and animals consuming the leaves of plants will thereforereceive strontium 90 in food as well as in water. The hazard is greater for
grazing animals than for man, since animals may crop herbage from wide areas of contaminated pasture. Man, moreover, relies for his food more ongrains and roots, which are not sites of concentration of strontium, and onanimal produce from which the animal has removed most of the strontiumto its bones. Cows&apos; milk contains strontium, but fortunately the cow in itsmetabolic processes secretes calcium into the milk in preference to strontium.236. The importance of radioactive strontium, compared with other long-lived fission products produced by exploding nuclear weapons, derives fromfour factors ; its relative abundance among the fission products, its facilityfor following calcium through the human food chain, the ease with whichit is absorbed, and the fact that, once absorbed, it is stored for long periodsin the bones of the body. In bones it forms more or less localised depositswhich, judging by animals experiments and according to analogy with theaction of radium compounds on human subjects, can if present in sufficientamounts give rise to bone tumours, or by irradiating the neighbouring bonemarrow, to a plastic anaemia or leukaemia. There is evidence that the youngare more susceptible to its action than adults. Such measurements as havebeen made of strontium 90 in human bone suggest that the highest levels areat present about a thousand times less than is considered permissible for those occupationally exposed.Plutonium237. Plutonium 239, another very long-lived radioactive element, is also a potentially dangerous contaminant, since like strontium it is deposited in bone.The amount of activity from plutonium in fall-out is small relative to thatof strontium 90, its solubility is low, and less than one-tenth of one per cent of the amount taken by mouth is absorbed. The hazard from plutonium infall-out debris is thus very small.Caesium238. Very sensitive methods of measuring the radioactivity of the humanbody have now been developed and, on the records obtained in recent months,there has been some indication of gamma radiation suspected to be due tothe long-lived fission product, caesium 137. Although it is not possible yet to identify with certainty the source of this radiation, calculations have beenmade on the assumption that it is due to this isotope. Caesium is not con-centrated in any particular organ of the body and, on the basis of present information, is unlikely materially to affect the figure given above for thedose from the fission products deposited on the ground.Other important isotopes239. Of the other elements in mixed fission products strontium 89 andradio-barium behaves similarly to strontium 90 ; radio-iodine, which is easilyabsorbed, is highly concentrated in the thyroid gland. These three isotopes,having half lives which are only a matter of days, are of very little sig-nificance in relation to the long-range fall-out from atomic bombs, since mostof their radioactivity will have decayed before they are deposited. In relationto the heavily contaminated areas within a few hundred miles of the explosion of a thermonuclear bomb, however, they will be of great importance.TOTAL GONAD DOSE FROM MAN-MADE SOURCES OF RADIATION240. Information on the total dose to the gonads from man-made sources of radiation is summarised in Table 4, the dose from each source beingexpressed as a percentage of the dose received from natural sources. It willbe seen that the total dose amounts to approximately 30 per cent of that already received from the natural background.

Atomic bombs were developed for their capacity to create blast,which was the chief cause of casualties at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Theadditional effects of the detonation of a nuclear weapon are due to the releaseof other forms of energy heat and ionizing radiation. The ionizingradiations produced by the weapons are a new feature of military opera-tions. Of the prompt radiations, produced at the moment of explosion,neutrons are the direct result of the process of nuclear fission. Gammarays are also a by-product of fission but most of these are produced immedi-ately after the detonation by the enormous quantities of radioactive fissionproducts. The rapid ending of the gamma-flash at ground level after an explosion is due partly to the ephemeral nature of the radioactivities of manyof the fission products and partly to the very rapid removal of the debris inthe up-draught of hot gases.242. The effective range of the prompt ionizing radiations from an ordinaryatomic bomb explosion is less than that of the thermal radiation, and atHiroshima and Nagasaki the range within which death and severe injuryfrom ionizing radiations were encountered was about one mile, as comparedwith up to three miles for severe flash burns and five miles for indirect blasteffects.243. The notable feature of the ionizing radiations is that, in contrast tothe heat rays, they are very penetrating. Clothing which may be adequate toshield the body from heat flash is &quot; transparent&quot; to these rays, and even fourinches of concrete transmits half the radiation at a distance of one milefrom the atomic bomb burst. Thus, at ranges relatively close to such a weapon, people in stoutly constructed buildings might survive the effeotsof the heat and blast waves but suffer from the damaging effects of thepenetrating gamma-rays and neutrons.244. From the comparative ranges of the heat flash and ionizing radiationit will be seen that distance is a factor of great importance. With gamma-rays, as with heat, the intensity falls in proportion to the square of the distance and is diminished by an attenuation factor. It is unlikely that the prompt radiations from thermonuclear weapons would be relatively mor significant than those from atomic weapons. The hazard from radiation is
therefore only one of the immediate effects of nuclear weapon explosions,and a relatively minor one in a holocaust. Its particular importance lies inthe delayed and distant effects, which arise from the radioactive fissionproducts.245. At Hiroshima and Nagasaki the atomic bombs were exploded highin the air so as to obtain the maximum effects from blast. Virtually allthe fission products were therefore carried up with the hot gases and musthave been enormously diluted before being deposited gradually round theworld. Nevertheless, a minute fraction did fall to earth locally and must have contributed to the delayed effects recorded by the Atomic Bomb CasualtyCommission.246. When bombs are exploded in or near the surface of the ground or near the surface of water, much debris highly contaminated with fissionproducts is flung into the air and the large particles are deposited more orless locally. Some of intermediate particle size is carried by the local windsand gradually diffuses and settles down-wind. The best known phenomenon&apos;of this character following a test-explosion arose from the thermonucleardevice exploded on 1st March, 1954. According to the Press release inFebruary, 1955, of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, the areaover which fission products settled to give a radiation dose which mightwell have been lethal to a man unable to take shelter was about 7,000 square miles. Over a considerably larger area, conditions in the open would havebeen hazardous to man and beast. The size and shape of these lethal and.hazardous areas will vary with the conditions of the explosion and of thelocal meteorology. Nevertheless, the inferences are plain: weapons such as these can be devastating, not only locally over areas measuring hundreds ofsquare miles, but in their more distant effects, which may occur overthousands and tens of thousands of square miles.
CHAPTER VIASSESSMENT OF THE HAZARDS OF EXPOSURETO RADIATION247. We have reviewed the effects of radiation both upon the exposedindividual during his own lifetime and upon his descendants. It is now necessary to relate these effects to dose levels, and to attempt to assess theconsequences of exposure to those levels of radiation which now occur or might conceivably come about in the future.248. It will be recalled that human beings have always been exposed to radiation from outer space and from traces of radioactive materials intheir surroundings and in their own bodies. The problem is, therefore, to assess the effects of any additional radiation to which they are or may be subjected, rather than to define a new experience. Our ignorance of theresults of exposure to radiation is great and much intensive research isrequired in many fields; but the naturally occurring background of radiationto which mankind has long been adjusted can be taken with some confidenceas a safe standard of reference whether we are considering irradiation from outside the body or from radioactive materials taken into the body and stored,temporarily or permanently, in its tissues.Differences between individual and genetic effects249. Different considerations enter into the assessment of the significance of any particular level of exposure, according to whether we are concernedwith effects on the individual or with genetic effects. In respect of theeffects on the individual, we are concerned with doses received throughoutthe whole of life. In respect of genetic effects, however, we are concerned only with doses to the gonads received up to and during the reproductiveperiod of life. In this country the average age of mothers conceiving childrenis about 28 years ; of fathers two to four years older. We have therefore taken the period of 30 years to represent the average length of time during whichthe germ cell lineage of the human population is effectively exposed to radiation.From a genetic point of view, any exposure to radiation after reproductionhas ceased is irrelevant, since any mutations produced will not be passed onto future generations.250. The second important difference relates to the accumulation of theeffects of exposure on separate occasions. The genetic effects of radiationare cumulative; a mutation persists once it has been produced in a germcell lineage, and to it are added any further mutations that are inducedin the same reproductive cells. Since dose and effect are proportional, weare concerned, from the genetic point of view, with the total dose of radiationwhich has been accumulated up to any particular time in the reproductiveperiod of life.251. The position with regard to the additive effects of successive doses onthe individual is incompletely known. It is certain that a dose of radiationwhich would produce acute effects if given as one single exposure may produceno similar effects if spread over a longer period. Moreover, if a sufficient periodhas elapsed after recovery from the acute effects, the individual may againrecover from a further exposure which produces acute symptoms. Uncertainty
arises in relation to some important delayed effects of radiation where, inview of the results on the increased incidence of leukaemia in repeatedlyirradiated cases of ankylosing spondylitis, we must now entertain the possi-bility that repeated exposures to radiation may combine to produce certainirreversible changes in the tissues exposed.Dosage and Effects on the IndividualAcute effects252. The effects which appear within the first 48 hours are seen only asa result of accidents and in those within a short distance from an atomicbomb explosion, or occasionally after exposure to the heavy doses of radiation which may be necessary in the treatment of serious illnesses byradiotherapy. They are, therefore, not important in ordinary civiliancircumstances.253. The same considerations apply to the acute effects on the bloodoccurring up to two months after exposure to a single dose or to a few heavydoses of radiation. Similar effects occurring later can, however, be produced by doses of radiation, given continuously or repeated at short intervals,which would not be sufficient to produce any symptoms in the first few hours.Formerly, it was thought that continuous exposure to TO r per week would produce no effects on the blood but, after some individuals were found to beaffected by this dose, the figure recommended by national and international bodies as the maximum permissible level was reduced to 0&apos;3 r per week.Delayed effects254. Of the delayed effects, the one about which we have most informa-tion is leukaemia. It also appears to be the most easily induced and seems,at present, to be the most important as far as radiation of the whole bodyis concerned. We have therefore taken the incidence *of leukaemia as ameasure of the doses of radiation that are capable of producing delayedeffects. The statistical evidence indicates that an increased incidence ofleukaemia can be demonstrated after exposure to doses of radiation whichmight, in exceptional circumstances, be met with in civil life. For example,after either a single exposure of 200 r, or after a few exposures which in total amount to 200 r, there is a noteworthy increase in the small chance of developing this disease. What we do not know for certain is whether therewould be an increase, if a total dose of 200 r were spread over many years.Be this as it may, however, any risk that there may be from such a doseappears to be within the range of those of other kinds commonly incurred in industrial and professional life.255. We consider, therefore, that an individual could, without feeling undueconcern about developing any of the delayed effects, accept a total dose of200 r in his life-time, provided that this dose is distributed over tens of yearsand that the maximum weekly exposure, averaged over any period of 13consecutive weeks, does not exceed 0-3 r. We recommend, however, that the aim should always be to keep the level of exposure as low as possible.Internal radiation256. The problem of irradiation by radioactive materials taken into the body is in some ways a more complex and difficult one. The material is often concentrated in a particular tissue, such as bone, where it may giverise to malignant change. Owing to the short distance that the rays from aparticular concentration of radioactive material can penetrate the tissues, thedose of radiation is extremely variable, from place to place in the body.
-    219Nevertheless, on the basis of the known levels of external radiation that can be tolerated, and of experience gained from the accidental ingestionof substances such as radium, &apos; permissible&apos; levels of exposure for a largenumber of radioactive isotopes have been agreed. No single level that com-prehends them all can be given, since each isotope emits its own characteristicamount and type of radiation, dies away at its own rate, and is absorbed andexcreted at a rate dependent on its chemical form and its method of entry into the body. However, it has now been possible to estimate for many different isotopes the concentrations that it is safe to accumulatedDosage and Genetic Effects257. Our conclusion in the chapter on genetics was that &apos; For levels of radiation up to the doubling dose, and even some way beyond, the geneticeffects of radiation are only appreciable when reckoned over the populationas a whole and need cause no alarm to the individual on his own account&apos;.In other words they are essentially problems for society as a whole to be assessed in terms oif the load of medical care that may, in different circum-stances, be imposed on the population.258. In ordinary circumstances only a small fraction, perhaps one or twoper cent, of the hereditary abnormalities which appear in a generation canbe attributed to fresh gene mutations. For the offspring of any given parentsthe risk from increasing the mutation rate is very slight. Nevertheless, if thewhole of a large population is exposed to enough radiation appreciably to affect mutation rates, an increase even in this small fraction may add up to alarge number of new cases. The same number of mutations will be produced by a given dose of radiation whether this is distributed over the whole popula-tion or only to a part. It is only, however, in the improbable event of theirradiated group intermarrying with each other over several generations, andnot mating with the unirradiated population, that there is likely to be anappreciably greater manifestation of hereditary defects among their descend-ants. In all ordinary circumstances this is unlikely to occur. A fraction of thecommunity can, therefore, without significant genetic risk to their progenyor harm to the population as a whole, receive doses of radiation which wouldbe likely to have serious effects if applied, to the whole population (seeparagraph 186).259. From the genetic point of view, we have therefore to consider radia-tion dosage under three headings:(i) The dose which the individual can accept without undue concern about its possible effects on his own progeny.(ii) The dose which can be accepted by a fraction of the population whoseoccupation exposes them to more than the dose of radiation receivedby the ordinary member of the community.(iii) The dose which can be accepted by the whole population.Dose to the individual in relation to genetic effects260. We have concluded that doses up to, and somewhat beyond, the&apos; doubling dose&apos; need cause no undue concern to the individual as regardshis own offspring. Further, we gave reasons for believing that the valuesfor the doubling dose of radiation for human genes may be, in general, inthe range of 30 r to 80 r. We consider, therefore, that an individual could* Precise data for a large number of isotopes are given, for example, in the Recommenda-tions of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (1954) (Brit, J. Radiol.,N.S., Suppl. No. 6).
reasonably accept a total dose to the gonads of not more than 50 r fromconception to the age of 30 years, in addition to that received from thenatural background. There will be no undue risk to parents who havechildren over this age provided the rate of exposure laid down in Paragraph255 is not exceeded.Dose to occupationally exposed groups261. Similar considerations apply to groups of the community whoseoccupation exposes them to more than the usual dose of radiation. Providedthat such groups do not in aggregate total more than one-fiftieth of ourpopulation, we consider that all their members could each safely receive atotal gonad dose of up to 50 r from conception to the age of 30 years inaddition to that received from the natural background.Dose to the whole population262. In the chapter on genetics we tried to give an indication of the load on the community that might be imposed by a doubling of mutation rates.It will be generally agreed that such a load should not voluntarily beaccepted. In relation to genetic changes in the whole population, the significantfigure is the total gonad dose of radiation which is received by all thosecapable of reproduction. A relatively high dose to a fraction of the popula-tion can only be offset by a correspondingly low dose to the remainder.If, therefore, we are to contemplate the possibility and the necessity todevelop the beneficent uses of atomic energy and ionizing radiations forcesus to do so that a significant fraction of our population may in future beallowed to receive doses of radiation of a similar order to the doublingdose, then it becomes additionally important to ensure that the dose of radiation to the rest of the community shall be held at the lowest possible level.263. In view of the inadequacy of present knowledge, however, we do not feel justified in naming any specific figure as a limit for the average exposureof the whole population. It is nonetheless highly desirable that such a figure should be named as soon as possible and we understand that the Inter-national Commission on Radiological Protection has this matter underconsideration. In the meantime, we feel bound to state our opinion that itis unlikely that any authoritative recommendation will name a figure fora permissible radiation dose to the whole population, additional to thatreceived from natural sources, which is more than twice that of the generalvalue for natural background radiation. The recommended figure may indeed be appreciably lower than this ; and we consider that those on whom reststhe responsibility for authorising the development and use of sources ofionizing radiation would be well advised to keep this possibility in mind.The Hazards from Radiation264. In the light of these general criteria, we may now proceed to examinethe various hazards, actual and potential, to which the population in a country like our own may be exposed in consequence of the increasing use ofionizing radiation. In doing so, it will ibe necessary to distinguish between thehazards of peacetime experience and those which may Ibe encountered inwar.PEACETIME HAZARDS265. The development of modern civilisation has led to the increasing useof processes which produce radiations. Its future progress will come to depend, to an ever increasing extent, upon their further exploitation in powerproduction, in industry, in medicine and in agriculture, as well as in basic
-    220scientific research. It would be impossible to abolish their use withoutdenying ourselves services upon which we have already come to rely ; and,in the future, nuclear energy will constitute a major, if not the most important,physical factor upon which our civilisation will depend. In assessing thehazards consequent upon its use, it is therefore necessary to maintain a sense of perspective and to weigh, as society has done in the case of steam-power,electricity and the internal combustion engine, the risks entailed against theadvantages to be gained from the employment of this newer source of power. The risks are twofold: those to the individual and those to thepopulation as a whole. In regard to the former, we may indicate our ownassessment by saying that, in view of the small numbers likely to be employedin atomic power production and of experience already gained in the effective-ness of protective methods, it seems probable that a given amount of powermight be made available to the community at a smaller cost in accidents,illness and disability than that involved in present methods of mining and power production. The novel aspect of the situation lies in the possiblegenetic risk to the community as a whole. The considerations which we have put forward suggest that, although this is at present small and seems unlikelyever to be large, it is potentially important. We propose now to indicate the relative hazards of particular uses and to point out where and how these may be expected to increase or should be curtailed.266. In the chapter on exposure levels, the contributions of the variousman-made sources of ionizing radiation to the total exposure were expressed as percentages of the radiation received from natural sources ; and it was shown that today the population of this country receives, from man-madesources, a dose of radiation equivalent to at least one-quarter of that fromthe natural background. In itself this figure, which amounts to amout TO rover a period of 30 years, can give rise to no immediate apprehensions;but its significance should not be disregarded. From the point of view of population genetics, all extra radiation is undesirable, and it is at least a portent that, in the half century following the discovery of ionizing radia-tion, man has increased his exposure levels by about 30 per cent. It doesnot therefore seem to be too early to suggest where the use of ionizing radia-tion might be restricted.Medical diagnostic radiology267. The greatest contribution in this country to the increased exposureto radiation comes from medical diagnostic radiology, the application ofwhich has been steadily increasing in amount and scope in recent years.A large proportion of the genetically significant dose derived from diagnosticradiology is contributed by relatively few types of examinations, of whichfluoroscopic and radiological examination of the female pelvis and X-rayexaminations of the hip joint and lumbar spine in males are importantexamples. Clearly, the small genetic risk to the community and to indi-viduals must be weighed against the possible great advantage and evennecessity of the radiological examination to the particular patient. The finaldecision must be made on medical grounds. There can, however, be no doubtthat the risk could in many instances be reduced, not only by a reductionof the actual number of examinations carried out on young people, butalso by the use of modern methods of X-ray examination and by strict limita-tion of the X-ray beam to those parts of the body which have to be exposed.From the point of view of the dose distributed over the population as a whole,and from the point of view of the special risks to individuals associatedwith examinations involving heavy exposure, we are of the opinion thatthe time has arrived for a review of present practice in diagnostic radiology.
Radiotherapy268. The dangers associated with the heavy exposures employed in radio-therapy are well recognised, and the illnesses for which it is used are usuallyso serious that the risks can be fully justified. In addition, many of the patients treated for cancer are of an age when the genetic risk will be small. Nevertheless, treatment by radiotherapy of certain non-malignantconditions, particularly in children, could with advantage be reconsideredfrom the point of view of reassessing the risks entailed against the benefitsconferred.269. The increasing use of therapeutic amounts of radioactive isotopesmust also be carefully assessed and controlled, although at the present timethe total used is probably of little practical significance from a geneticalpoint of view. Should, however, their use become widespread in relation tocommon diseases of early or middle life, they might make a significant con-tribution. The risks from the use of &apos; tracer&apos; amounts of radioactive sub-stances in diagnosis and investigation are at present very small.Occupational exposure: Atomic Energy Authority employees270. For a number of years the main group of persons exposed to radia-tions were workers in the X-ray and radium departments of hospitals. Later,this experience was supplemented by careful observations of those employedin atomic energy projects and the various atomic industries. We have alreadyseen that, as a result of all this experience, the maximum permissible levelof radiation for workers was fixed at 0-3 r per week, and this figure is stillregarded as a satisfactory working level provided that it is not maintained for years on end. There is, however, no large factor of safety in this figure and, as we have seen above, other limitations are needed in the case of thoseexposed over very long periods of time. The excellent practice of the atomic energy Authority, now the main industrial employer of persons occupa-tionally exposed to radiation, is shown by their record that the averageexposure of their employees is less than half a roentgen yearly, and that their contribution to the population gonad dose is only about 0-1 per cent of thatcontributed by the natural background. These, however, are average doses ;but, even if one takes the maximum exposure of those employees engagedin special tasks, this has only occasionally and for short periods approached the maximum permissible dose of 0-3 r per week. In view of the expecteddevelopment of atomic energy as a source of power, this evidence of theawareness of the risk, and of the care with which it is being met, givesjustifiable grounds for reassurance.Radioactive effluents271. Concern has been expressed about the possible emission from somenuclear reactors of radioactive particulate matter, which on inhalation mightlodge in the lungs and give rise ultimately to cancer. This possible risk iswell recognised and has been effectively dealt with.272. Similar concern has been felt about the disposal of radioactive wastes.It is true that the amounts of radioactive material involved are formidable,but by treatment, by long-term storage to allow of decay, by concentration torelatively small bulk and subsequent burial in sealed containers or disposal inthe depths of the ocean, there seems no reason to doubt that this problem can continue to be solved. In this country strict control of the hazard is exercised by legislation.Hospital employees273. The handling of large quantities of radioactive isotopes in the treat-ment and investigation of patients in hospitals raises many difficult problems
331but, with adequate care and training of the workers concerned, experience shows that the doses received can be kept down to one-tenth or less of themaximum permissible levels.274. In this country a code of practice, formulated by the Ministry ofHealth on the advice of the Medical Research Council, has been drawn upfor the National Health Service. This lays down the relevant permissible levels of exposure as well as giving instructions and suggestions for the implement a-tion of these in practice.Other industrial employees275. The control of radiological hazards in non-atomic industry will bemore difficult to codify owing to the wide variety of circumstances in whichionizing radiations are used. Measurements of the doses received by manyworkers are made periodically, but it is difficult to avoid the impression that industrial personnel are, in general, less aware of the hazards of radiationthan those engaged in the fields of medicine and atomic energy. The record of the Atomic Energy Authority shows the standard that is attainable andthe practicability of being satisfied with nothing less.Definition and review of safety standards276. All these problems are under close and continuous scrutiny. Expertnational committees, notably those of the Medical Research Council and ministry of Health, work in close conjunction with international bodiessuch as the International Commission on Radiological Protection (itselfassociated with the World Health Organization), so that a width of experience is brought to bear on all these problems, and the standards of safety are under constant review.Miscellaneous sources of radiation277. There are several other sources of radiation which at present con-tribute only very small amounts but which cannot be disregarded. Thepractice of routinely examining the feet by X-rays when fitting shoes is ofdubious value and, in view of the possibilities of multiple exposures to children, may be dangerous. On the basis of avoiding any unnecessaryexposure, it is in our view hardly justifiable. We hope that the procedurewill be abandoned, except when prescribed for orthopaedic reasons.278. The contribution of radiation from watches and clocks with luminousdials is also small but real. The main hazard is to workers in the luminisingindustry but the risk from the widespread use of such instruments is not entirely negligible. We recognise that there are circumstances which requirethe use of instruments with luminous dials. In the majority of cases, however,there is no such necessity and their wider use constitutes an avoidable, ifsmall, risk which could be minimised for all concerned if the amount ofradioactive material in these instruments was reduced to the lowest possible level.279. It has been recognised that television sets give rise to very small amounts of X-rays, but at the present time radiation from this source doesnot constitute either a personal or a significant genetic hazard. This applies to domestic sets working at normal operational voltages but, near specialtypes of high voltage projection equipment used commercially, the radiationmay reach significant levels, although it is improbable that in practice anyoperator would be appreciably exposed. Nevertheless, the possibility of television equipment giving rise to radiations should be borne in mind when
considering the design and &quot;operation of such instruments. So far as setsused by the general public are concerned, most of the radiation is normallyabsorbed in the apparatus itself and is insignificant at the usual viewingdistances.Test explosions of nuclear weapons280. It is impossible to explode a nuclear weapon without liberating radio-active matter into the atmosphere. As described in the chapter on exposurelevels, the radioactive material diffuses all over the world and in the courseof time gradually deposits on the surface of the earth and comes into contact with human beings. Continuation for an indefinite time of testing at thesame rate as over the last few years would gradually increase the contamination-tion of the atmosphere, until in about 100 years time the average individualin this country would receive a dose of external radiation to the gonads of1-026 r in 30 years of his life, an amount which represents only one per cent of that received from the natural background. The effects of such a dose of external radiation are insignificant.281. Account must be taken, however, of the particular hazard from radio-active strontium in the fall-out. The maximum permissible level of strontium90 in the human skeleton, accepted by the International Commission onRadiological Protection, corresponds to 1000 micromicrocuries per gramme ofcalcium. But this is the maximum permissible level for adults in specialoccupations and it is not suitable for application to the population as a wholeor to children with their greater sensitivity to radiations and greater expecta-tion of life. It is known that radio-strontium is more heavily concentrated inthe bones of young than of adult animals, and the few measurements on human bones indicate that at the present time those of children contain about ten times the concentration found in those of adults. We consider, therefore,that the maximum allowable concentration of radio-strontium in the bonesof the general population, with its proportion of young children, should notbe greater than 100 micromicrocuries of strontium 90 per gramme of calcium.282. In this country, measurements on human bones of the radio-strontiumcontent, derived from the nuclear explosions that have already occurred, showthat the irradiation from this source is now reaching about one thousandth ofthe maximum permissible occupational level; and calculation of the fall-outlikely to come, if the present rate of firing continues, suggests that this levelmay be increased ten-fold in the course of several decades. The present level would produce no detectable increase in the incidence of ill-effects. It is evident, however, that we are now accumulating radiostrontium at an appreciable rate and that a close watch will need to be kept oh this increase.283. In the light of knowledge at present available we should feel that immediate consideration were required if the concentration in human bonesshowed signs of rising greatly beyond one hundredth of that corresponding to the maximum permissible occupational level.284. We are well aware of the inadequacy of our knowledge of thebiological effects of radioactive strontium and of the urgent necessity to obtain further information. Nevertheless, recognising all the inadequacy of ourpresent knowledge, we cannot ignore the possibility that, if the rate of firingincreases and particularly if greater numbers of thermo-nuclear weapons are used, we could, within the life-time of some now living, be approachinglevels at which ill-effects might be produced in a small number of thepopulation, ,
222W rv NPEACETIME HAZARDS:   GENERAL CONCLUSIONS285. The general conclusion to be drawn from a consideration of thehazards inseparable from the application of ionizing radiations in peacetimeis that at present there is no cause for alarm ; but that, as all such radiationsare potentially dangerous, their use should be the subject of constant and close scrutiny, and that adequate justification should be required for their employment on however small a scale. There is a limit to the amount of radiation which any population or any individual can accept and we cannot afford to expend, without careful forethought, the margin which is now available to us.WARTIME HAZARDS^ 286. We have given a brief resume of the effects of nuclear warfare.From this it will be seen that there are three broad categories of effect:those within the range of the actual explosion, those within the contiguousarea in which radioactive fission products settle and world-wide effects dueto the contamination of the atmosphere.287. Within close range of the explosion, nuclear radiations are but oneelement in the destructive effect. Blast and heat would be of major andprobably of more immediate importance in producing casualties but survivors,unless heavily sheltered, would have been exposed to such an intensity of radiation that they would be at risk of developing each and all of the effectswe have described.288. Explosions of atomic weapons always give rise to radioactive fissionproducts, the heavier particles of which settle in the vicinity. In the case of aground burst of a thermonuclear weapon, the area of intense fall-out maycover hundreds of square miles. Within this area, those who were not inshelter, and did not remain under cover until the radioactivity of the fall-outhad decayed substantially, would be exposed to intensities of radiationsufficient to produce the effects described in all grades of severity. Outsidethis area, there would be another zone, measured in thousands of square miles, where significant intensities of radiation would occur and where a proportion of those exposed would be at risk of serious consequences.289. It must be emphasised that these doses, both from the point of viewof the individual and of the general population, are several thousand timesgreater than those we have considered as possible peacetime hazards.290. The importance of the effects of atomic warfare which would be relayedthrough contamination of the atmosphere, to parts of the world remote fromthe actual conflict, would depend upon the number and type of bombsexploded. Given a sufficient number of bombs, no part of the world wouldescape exposure to biologically significant levels of radiation. To a -greater or less degree, a legacy of genetic damage would be incurred, and anincreased incidence of delayed effects on the individual would probablybe induced. Although it is difficult to imagine the general occurrence of radiation intensities which would eliminate the entire human race, atomicwarfare on a large scale could not fail to increase for many generations the load of distress and suffering that individuals and all human societies wouldbe called upon to support.
CHAPTER VIISUMMARY291. The future development of civilisation is bound up with the exploita-tion of nuclear energy. The use of radiation energy, like that of other sources of energy, entails risk, but the risk is controllable and, within limits, can beaccepted. It is the scale and not the nature of the hazard that is new, for human populations have always been exposed to natural radiation of lowintensity. (Paragraphs 1-14.)THE NATURE OF RADIATION AND ITS ACTION ON LIVING CELLS292. Ionizing radiations are so described because they cause the formationof electrically charged particles, ions, in the matter through which they pass.The common types of penetrating radiation are X-rays, gamma rays, alphaand beta particles, and neutrons. Alpha particles cannot penetrate tissuebeyond a fraction of a millimetre but gamma rays, and X-rays produced byextremely high voltages, can traverse the whole body.    (Paragraphs 15-20.)293. The biological effects of radiation are related to the intensity of radia-tion and to the period of exposure. The basic unit of radiation dosage whichhas been generally used is the roentgen (r). All living tissue can be killedif exposed to sufficiently high doses of radiation. The effects of dosages below those which damage tissues irretrievably may be modified by processes ofhealing, so that the response to a dose of radiation which is spread over along time may be much smaller than, or quite different from, the responsewhich would occur if the same dose were given in a very short time. this does not apply to the important type of genetic effects, called gene mutation,produced by the irradiation of reproductive cells, the consequences of whichare cumulative and irreversible. (Paragraphs 21-27.)THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION ON THE HEALTH OF THE INDIVIDUALSources of information294. Our knowledge of the effects of ionizing radiations on human beingscomes from four main sources: from the uses of X-rays and radium in thetreatment of disease, mainly of cancer ; from a study of the occupationalhazards of medical radiologists, workers in the luminising industry, and miners of radioactive ores ; from a study of the victims of atom bombexplosions ; and from experiments on animals. (Paragraphs 28-34.)The harmful effects of radiation on man295. Almost all the effects of ionizing radiation on tissues are essentiallydeleterious. The benefits to the individual patient of the eradication of amalignant tumour by radiotherapy result from selective damage to thetumour cells. The nature and severity of radiation injury is determined bythe type and dosage of radiation received, the part and extent of the bodyirradiated, the length of the period of exposure, and the age of the personsexposed. The harmful effects may be classified into those which developwithin a few weeks of exposure, and delayed effects which may not make their appearance until many years after exposure. (Paragraphs 35-42.)
Effects occurring within a few weeks of exposure296. The effect of exposing the whole body to a single dose of gammaradiation of the order of 500 r is such that all the persons so exposed would develop acute illness and at least half would die. In civil life, exposure to sucha dosage could occur only under the most exceptional circumstances, forexample in the immediate vicinity of an accident in a nuclear reactor.With smaller single doses, for example of 100 r, not more than 15 per cent of an exposed population would suffer acute illness and very few, if any,of those affected would die. After a single dose of 50 r, acute illness wouldbe very rare. The relationship between the dose of radiation received andthe effects that may be produced within a few weeks of exposure is not oneof strict proportionality ; with each successive and equal increment of dosagethe response increases by a progressively greater amount, at least until verylarge changes have been produced. (Paragraphs 43-50.)The delayed effects of radiation297. Delayed effects of exposure to radiation may occur at any time afterthe end of the second month. Disorders of the skin and underlying softtissues and of bone may occur and there may be subsequent developmentof cancer. Cataracts, severe anaemias and leukaemia have been caused andthere is some evidence that exposure to radiation may cause death at aprematurely early age. (Paragraphs 51-52.)Leukaemia298. Leukaemia is a disease in which there is an uncontrolled over-production of white blood corpuscles. Experiments on animals have shownthat the incidence of leukaemia is increased by irradiation. Clear evidencethat the same is true of man comes from two main sources: a study by the atomic Bomb Casualty Commission of the incidence of leukaemia inHiroshima and Nagasaki, and a survey under our sponsorship of the incidence of leukaemia among patients treated by radiation for ankylosing spondylitis.(Paragraphs 53-55.)299. Ninety-three proved and fourteen suspected cases of leukaemia havebeen recorded in Hiroshima and Nagasaki between 1947 and 1954 among those present at the time of the explosion and still resident in the cities ;the expected incidence in an unexposed but otherwise comparable population is twenty-five. The difference is greater than can be attributed to chance.Moreover, there was a much higher frequency of occurrence among thosewho had developed early acute radiation illness and among those whohad been nearer to the centre of the explosion. The latent period, that isthe average length of the period between the explosion and the first appear-ance of symptoms of leukaemia, was about six years. The evidence suggeststhat with this type of exposure to radiation the likelihood of developingleukaemia, after its initial rise, remains approximately constant up to at least the ninth year. (Paragraphs 56-61.)300. Ankylosing spondylitis is a disease in which the joints, particularly those of the spine, progressively lose their freedom of movement. In thetreatment of this condition very extensive areas of the body are exposed to irradiation. The records of between 13,000 and 14,000 patients, who hadbeen treated with X-rays between 1933 and 1954, have been studied. Up to1955, thirty-seven of these patients developed leukaemia, an incidence which,although only about one-third of one per cent, is about ten times greaterthan the normal expectation. No increased incidence of leukaemia was foundamong 400 patients who had not been treated by irradiation, but the numberis too small to exclude completely the possibility that ankylosing spondylitis
may of itself predispose its sufferers to leukaemia ; nor can the possibility be excluded that these patients are more liable than the average person todevelop leukaemia after irradiation. Nevertheless, there is clear evidence of acorrespondence between the dosage of radiation received and the incidence of leukaemia. The average length of the latent period between the firstexposure to X-rays and the diagnosis of leukaemia was about six years.(Paragraphs 62-69.)301. The conditions of exposure to radiation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki,and in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, are not comparable with theirradiation in small doses over long periods which might be received by persons engaged in work with a possible radiation hazard. Some evidencehas been presented suggesting an increased death rate due to leukaemiaamong radiologists but our knowledge of the occurrence of leukaemia under conditions of chronic exposure is too scanty to allow any reliable conclusions to be drawn. (Paragraphs 70-71.)Cancers302. Two characteristics of cancers induced by radiation are noteworthy :the tendency of tumours to arise in tissues already severely damaged byradiation, and the long latent period, twenty years or more, before they appear. (Paragraph 72.)303. A study of the pitchblende miners of Schneeberg and Joachimsthalsuggests strongly that the inhalation of radioactive gas may lead to cancerof the lung. The latent period has been put at seventeen years and thedosage to the lungs over that period at more than lOOr and in some parts ofthe lung much higher. In theory, the inhalation of radioactive particlesin the fall-out from atomic explosions or in the vicinity of nuclear reactorscould also lead to cancer of the lung, but the former hazard is extremely unlikely in peacetime, and steps are taken to ensure that the latter neveroccurs. (Paragraphs 73-76.)304. Radium, mesothorium, plutonium and radioactive forms of strontiumare accumulated by and retained in bone. Until the enforcement of stringentcontrols, cancer of bone occurred among workers in the luminising industry as a result of swallowing radium-containing paint. The latent period was more than fifteen years. (Paragraphs 77-82.)305. Cancer of the skin was the earliest form of radiation-induced tumourto be described in man. By 1911, before the adoption of modern safe-guards, fifty-four cases had been described among the pioneers of radiology.The doses of radiation which have led to the formation of skin cancers musthave been several thousand r. (Paragraphs 83-84.)306. Cancer of the thyroid gland in children has been a sequel to irradia-tion of the neck for enlargement of the thymus gland. This form of canceris distinguished by its short latent period (about 7 years) and the compara-tively low dosage of radiation required to induce it. However, it is not unlikely that other factors are involved here in addition to the direct effectof irradiation. (Paragraphs 85-86.)Other delayed effects307. A fall in the number of red cells and white cells in the blood mayfollow exposure of the whole body to even moderate doses of gammaradiation. If not detected in time a condition known as a plastic - anaemiamay occur. (Paragraphs 87-88.)
308. Cataract formation is known to have been caused by neutron irradia-tion, but for all practical purposes the production of cataract by X-rays isnot an occupational hazard. (Paragraphs 89-90.)309. Delayed effects of radiation on the skin extend from a temporary lossof hair after local dosages of 300r-400r to severe and permanent damageafter local exposure to single dosages of 1500r or more, and repeated dosestotalling 4000r or more in a number of weeks. It is in the skin damaged by these higher doses of radiation that tumours, when then occur, are most likely to develop. (Paragraphs 91-92.)310. Miscarriage and stillbirth may be a consequence of irradiationduring pregnancy, but they do not constitute a problem unless the dose of radiation is large. A number of different developmental abnormalities havebeen described in the children of women treated by irradiation duringpregnancy, the most conspicuous defect being microcephaly, a partial failureof the development of the brain. Eleven cases so classified are recorded inchildren irradiated before birth in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.(Paragraphs 95-97.)THE GENETIC EFFECTS OF RADIATION311. The assessment of the genetic effects of ionizing radiations is subjectto special difficulties. We believe that we have formed as fair an assessmentas is possible in the light of present knowledge, but our conclusions mustbe regarded as provisional. (Paragraph 100.)The material basis of heredity312. The physical determinants of heredity are genes, carried on chromo-somes in the nuclei of cells. Chromosomes are present in pairs ; one memberof the pair is of maternal origin, the other of paternal origin. There aretwenty-four pairs of chromosomes in human beings ; the number of genesis not known, but may well be many thousands. (Paragraphs 101-103.)313. The two genes which occupy corresponding positions on the twochromosomes of a pair are spoken of as alleles of each other. Alieles ofnew kinds arise by the process of mutation and are thereafter reproducedfaithfully in their altered form. (Paragraph 104.)314. Some genes produce the same effect whether they are paired with likeor with unlike alleles. Such genes, and the characters they determine, are described as dominant. Other genes produce a noticeable effect only whenpaired with similar alleles; these, and the characters they determine, are described as recessive. There is every gradation between these two extremes.A recessive gene can be transmitted in a family by an individual who givesno signs of carrying it. (Paragraphs 105-108.)315. Sex difference is determined by a special pair of chromosomes, andthe genes carried on these chromosomes are said to be sex-linked.(Paragraph 109.)316. So far as is known, all genes are subject to mutation, and mutationoccurs spontaneously all the time at a very low rate, Factors influencingmutation appear to affect only the frequency with which it happens. Newalleles of harmful effect are eliminated by natural selection until equilibriumis reached with the rate at which they are introduced by fresh mutation.Recessive alleles are eliminated more slowly than dominant alleles.(Paragraphs 111-118.)
Basic principles of the genetic effects of radiation317. There is little direct knowledge of the genetic effects of ionizingradiations on man, but with certain reservations it is justifiable to draw upon our knowledge of the effects of radiation on other organisms.(Paragraph 119.)318. Ionizing radiations have genetic consequences only in so far as theyaffect the reproductive cells or the cells ancestral to them in the reproductiveorgans (gonads). Two kinds of effect may have genetic consequences: thechromosomes may be damaged or the genes may be caused to mutate more frequently. Chromosome changes of the kind that can persist are only rarelyproduced by long continued exposure to X-rays or gamma rays of lowintensity. They are likely to be a comparatively unimportant radiationhazard. (Paragraphs 120-125.)319. It is the frequency of gene mutation that is increased by radiation ;there is no evidence and little likelihood that radiation produces entirely new kinds of genes. The rise in mutation rate is probably directly propor-tional to the amount of additional exposure to radiation, and any additionalexposure, however small, must be&apos; expected to raise the mutation rate, if only by a minute amount. (Paragraphs 126-127.)320. Damage to genetic material is cumulative and irreparable. Longcontinued exposure to radiation of low intensity induces as much gene muta-tion as a single exposure to an equal dosage of radiation of higher intensity.(Paragraph 128.)321. The age-distribution of those exposed to radiation has an important bearing on the future consequences of its effects. The genetic consequences of the irradiation of individuals beyond the age of reproduction are ofcourse nil. (Paragraph 129.)Effects of increased mutation on the incidence of disease in human populations322. The role of heredity in the production of disease ranges from that ofa predisposing to that of a preponderating cause. The effects which might beexpected to result from an increase in mutation rates can most easily be calculated for diseases known to be caused by single genes, but for relatively few such diseases have we sufficient evidence of the kind upon which sucha calculation must be based. (Paragraphs 130-135.)323. Achondroplasia, haemophilia, and phenylketonuria have been taken as examples of diseases known to be caused by single genes. If the mutationrates of these genes were to rise to, and remain at, twice their present values,the incidence of the diseases for which they are responsible would ultimately,though at very different rates, rise to twice or nearly twice their presentfrequencies. Calculations suggest that the incidence of achondroplasia, adominant form of dwarfism, would rise 80 per cent above its present value in a single generation ; haemophilia, a sex-linked disease, would take about six generations to rise by 90 per cent in frequency ; and phenylketonuria,a recessive disease associated with severe mental deficiency, would take, morethan fifty generations to increase its frequency by one half.(Paragraphs 136-139.)324. Mental diseases, the most important single category in whichhereditary causes are known to be important, account in all for nearly halfthe hospital population of the country. There are grounds for believing thata doubling of the mutation rates of the genes concerned with their causationwould, in one generation, increase the frequency of low-grade mental deficiency by three per cent, and of the two principal types of mental illness,
schizophrenia and manic depressive reaction, by about one per cent. Ifthe mutation rates were to remain at twice their present values, the incidence of mental diseases might on the most pessimistic assumptions double also,but would only attain this value after very many generations.(Paragraphs 140-150.)325. When all serious illnesses with a hereditary element in their causa-tion are taken into account, it is unlikely that the burden put upon societyby a doubling of mutation rates would exceed by more than a few times the contribution made by the increase of mental disease.     (Paragraph 154.)326. It must be remembered that a harmful recessive gene gives no outwardevidence of its presence until chance brings it together with another of itskind. The crop of newly mutated recessive genes caused by an increase ofmutation rates could cause suffering over many generations before all were finally eliminated. (Paragraphs 155-156.)Hereditary traits showing continuous variation about the normal327. Most of the variation between human beings is not of the sharp kind that can be traced to the action of single genes. Characters such as physique,intelligence and length of life vary over a wide range by imperceptiblegradations, and the hereditary portion of this variation is believed to be dueto the combined action of many genes. (Paragraphs 157-159.)328. The basic effect of an increase in mutation rates upon such characters,here exemplified by scores in intelligence tests, will be to increase the numbersof the more extreme types at the expense of the more average individuals. Adoubling of the mutation rates for a few generations would be expected tohave only the most trivial effect upon their variation. The effect of a per-manent doubling of the mutation rate would be, at most, to double the variation, and this would take hundreds of generations to achieve.(Paragraphs 160-161.)Observations on populations exposed to radiation329. Three direct studies have been made on the children of human beingswho have been exposed to ionizing radiations. Two, on the children of american radiologists, were for a variety of reasons inconclusive ; the thirdis the extensive study made by the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission onthe children of those who were in Hiroshima and Nagasaki when the atomicbombs exploded. All three studies are limited to observations on the firstgeneration, so that little effect would yet have become manifest even if themutation rate had increased. (Paragraphs 162-166.)330. The evidence assembled in the report of the Atomic Bomb CasualtyCommission is beset by many difficulties of interpretation, but we believe thatit reveals, in the children of those who were the more heavily exposed, aslight but significant change in the sex ratio which might be due to geneticdamage. From the nature of the evidence a doubling of the rate of incidence of congenital malformations, or a 50 per cent rise in the stillbirth rates, mighthave escaped detection if they had occurred. The evidence does not allowus to make any useful estimate of the radiation dose which doubles themutation rate in man. (Paragraphs 167-170.)The &apos; doubling dose&apos; in man331. An assessment of the sensitivity of human genes to radiation isparticularly difficult. Any such estimate should be based upon a sample ofgenes large enough to be representative of all the effects they exercise, for itcannot be assumed that al genes are equally radiosensitive, nor that the
proportion of the spontaneous mutation rate which can be attributed tonatural radiations is the same for different genes. (Paragraphs 171-175.)332. If all mutations were indeed due to radiation, then the dosage whichdoubled their frequency would be expected to be equal to that receivedfrom natural sources, namely, a dosage to the gonads of about 3 r inthirty years. The available evidence suggests, however, that the percentageof human mutations that are caused by natural radiation might lie between per cent and 20 per cent, and if this is so the doubling dose will lie between 15 r and 150 r. (Paragraphs 176-181.)333. The direct estimates which have been made of the doubling dosesfor a variety of plants and animals mostly run from 25 r upwards. It is truethat none of the more fully investigated organisms has a lifetime comparable with man&apos;s, but there are theoretical grounds for believing that the organismswith the longer pre-reproductive periods might be expected to have theless radiosensitive genes. (Paragraph 182.)334. The evidence at our disposal, though far from adequate, leads usto conclude that there is rather little likelihood that the real value forthe doubling dose for human genes lies between 3 r and 15 r ; and that,although we cannot exclude the possibility that for some human genes the doubling dose may be less than 30 r and for others more than 80 r, thebest estimate that we can make in the light of present knowledge, is thatthe value in general lies somewhere between 30 r and 80 r.    (Paragraph 183.)335. Even if the doubling dose were as low as the minimum we can reason-ably entertain, namely 15 r, it is extremely improbable that in times of peacemore than a small fraction of the population could receive an extra doseof this size. The frequency of naturally-occurring hereditary abnormalities is such that, if comparatively few individuals received such a dose, there wouldbe no noticeable effect on their immediate offspring or on their descendantseven over several centuries. For levels of radiation up to the doubling dose,and even some way beyond, the genetic effects of radiation are only appre-appreciable when reckoned over the population as a whole, and need not causealarm to the individual on his own account. (Paragraphs 184-188.)EXISTING AND FORSEEABLE LEVELS OF EXPOSURE TO RADIATION336. Doses of radiation which are of no known significance to theindividual may have genetic consequences. Exposure levels must thereforebe expressed in terms of the total dosage to the gonads received by thepopulation as a whole during the period of reproductive life.(Paragraphs 189-191.)Radiation from natural sources337. The natural sources of radiation are cosmic rays and the naturally-occurring radioactive elements. From all such sources an individual in thiscountry receives, on the average, a total gonad dose of about 3 r over aperiod of thirty years. (Paragraphs 192-201.)Radiation from the appurtenances of civilisation338. Over the past sixty years man has made increasing use of X-raysand radioactive materials in medicine, industry, and ordinary civil life. Theadditional gonad doses received from these sources by people of this country are expressed below as percentages of the gonad dose which they alreadyreceive from natural sources. (Paragraph 202.)339. We have conducted a limited survey which suggests that the addi-tional dose received from the various forms of diagnostic radiology may well
22be higher than 22 per cent, the major amount of which is accounted forby examination of a relatively few sites of the body. The contributionmade by the use of radiation in medical treatment cannot be accuratelyestimated ; it is probably much less than that made by diagnostic radiologybut greater than that received from any other artificial source.(Paragraphs 203-206.)340. Watches and clocks with radioactively luminous dials and X-raysfrom television sets each contribute about one per cent of additionalradiation. The contribution from X-ray apparatus used in shoe fitting is not likely to exceed 01 per cent. (Paragraphs 207-210.)341. The contribution arising from the work of the Atomic energy authority is the most accurately known, and is about 0T per cent. A study of the records of the National Radiological Protection Service has put the contribution from other occupational sources at about T6 per cent.(Paragraphs 212-217.)Contamination of the world by fall-out from the explosion of nuclear weapons342. Continual watch is kept by the Atomic Energy Authority on theradioactive fall-out reaching this country from nuclear devices explodedin other parts of the world. From the bombs exploded up to the presenttime, the population of this country may expect to receive, over the nextfifty years, additional radiation amounting to between 0-02 per cent and004 per cent of the radiation which will be received over the some period from natural sources. &apos; (Paragraphs 218-229.)343. If the firing of bombs were to continue indefinitely at the same rate as over the past few years, radioactivity would gradually accumulateto a level at which an inhabitant of this country would receive an averagedose of 0026 r over a period of thirty years, or about one per cent of thatwhich he would receive in the same period from natural sources.(Paragraph 320.)344. The contribution to this figure from thermonuclear explosions, relative to their numbers, is very great. If the rate of firing of weapons of this typeincreases, exposure to radiation will be significantly raised. (Paragraph 321.)Special hazards of radioactive fission products345. It is unlikely that the inhalation of radioactive particles presentin the air as a result of fall-out would constitute a problem in ordinarycivil life. (Paragraphs 232.)346. The deposition of radioactive strontium is probably a greaterhazard, because it is soluble and, if ingested, is deposited and retained inbone. Measurements which have been made of radioactive strontium in boneshow that the highest levels are at present about a thousand times less than is considered permissible for those who are occupationally exposed.(Paragraphs 234-239.)Atomic war347. Atomic bombs were developed for their capacity to create blast,but for persons exposed in the open the heat flash is equally to be feared.The ionizing radiations produced immediately after explosions have amuch greater penetrating power than the heat rays, but the range atwhich they cause death or immediate injury is somewhat less. The hazardfrom radiations is therefore only one of the immediate effects of atomicexplosions. Their peculiar danger lies in their distant and delayed effects.(Paragraphs 241-246.)
ASSESSMENT OF THE HAZARDS OF EXPOSURE TO RADIATION348. It is now necessary to assess the medical and genetic consequences of exposure to radiation at the levels of dosage which occur now or whichmight conceivably come about. The naturally occurring level of radiationcan be accepted as a standard of reference, because it is a level to whichmankind has long been adjusted. (Paragraphs 247-248.)349. In considering the genetic effects of radiation, we are concernedwith the sum, over the whole population, of the total gonad dose receivedby its members from conception until the end of reproductive life.(Paragraphs 249-250.)350. In considering the effects of radiation upon the individual, we areconcerned with his whole span of life, and with the rate at which theradiation is received as well as with its total dosage; and we must haveregard to the possibility that the severity of the effects produced by radiationmay increase in more than equal proportion to the dosage that is received.(Paragraph 251.)Dosage and effects on the individual351. The acute effects of radiation which appear within two months ofexposure to a single or a few heavy doses do not enter into ordinary civilcalculations; nor is it feared that they may be produced by repeatedexposures to doses that do not exceed 0-3 r per week. (Paragraphs 252-253.)352. Of the delayed effects of irradiation of the whole body, leukaemiais probably the most easily induced. We consider that an individual could,without feeling undue concern about developing any of the delayed effects,accept a total dose of 200 r in his life-time, provided that this dose is distri-buted over tens of years and that the maximum weekly exposure, averagedover any period of 13 consecutive weeks, does not exceed 0&apos;3 r. We recom-mend, however, that the aim should always be to keep the level of exposureas low as possible. (Paragraphs 254-255.)Dosage and genetic effects353. The genetic effects of radiation are essentially problems concerningthe future welfare of the population as a whole. (Paragraph 257.)354. It follows from the nature of the genetic effects, of radiation that asmall fraction of a population can, without harm to its members, receivedosages of radiation which would be likely to have serious genetic effectsif applied to the population as a whole. We feel that an individual, con-sidered as such, can accept a total gonad dose of not more than 50 r,from conception until the age of thirty, additional to that received from thenatural background, without undue concern for himself or his offspring,but that the number of such individuals should not exceed one-fiftieth ofthe population as a whole. (Paragraphs 258-262.)355. Our present knowledge does not justify us in naming any specificfigure as a limit for the average dose of radiation which might be receivedby the population as a whole. It is highly desirable that such a figure should be named as soon as possible ; and we understand that the Inter-national Commission on Radiological Protection has this matter under closeconsideration. In the meantime, we feel bound to state our opinion that itis unlikely that any authoritative recommendation will name a figure forpermissible radiation dose to the whole population, additional to thatreceived from the natural background, which is more than twice that ofthe general value for natural background radiation. The recommended valuemay, indeed, be appreciably lower than this. (Paragraph 263.)
The peacetime hazards from nuclear radiation356. Nuclear energy may become the principal source of power. So faras its use affects the small numbers likely to be employed in its production,we believe that nuclear energy might make power available at a lowercost in accidents, illnesses and disability than that incurred in connexionwith other sources of power. What is novel in the use of nuclear energy andthe other, increasing, uses of processes producing radiations is the geneticrisk to the community as a whole. The risk from civil usage is at presentsmall, and seems unlikely ever to be large ; but from the point of view of population genetics all possible extra radiation should be avoided, and itis not now too early to suggest where we might restrain its use.(Paragraphs 265-266.)357. With regard to occupational exposure we consider that the record of the Atomic Energy Authority shows the standard that is attainable andthe practicability of being satisfied with nothing less.  (Paragraphs 270-276;)358. We consider that the time has come for a review of present practice in diagnostic radiology, and of certain uses of radiation in the treatment ofnon-malignant conditions, particularly in children. Among the less importantsources of radiation, we hope that the use of X-rays in shoe-fitting will be abandoned except when prescribed for orthopaedic reasons ; that watchesand clocks with radioactively luminous dials will be confined to necessaryuses ; and that the X-ray hazard from television tubes, at present negligible,will be borne in mind if special types of high voltage equipment come tobe widely used. (Paragraph 267-269 and 277-279.)Test explosions of nuclear weapons359. The genetic effects to be expected from present or future radioactivefall-out from fired bombs at the present rate and in the present proportion ofthe different kinds are negligible. They might not be so, if present rates offiring were increased and particularly if a greater number of thermonuclearweapons were tested. (Paragraph 280.)360. So far as radioactive fall-out may affect the individual, we believethat immediate consideration would be required if the concentration of radio-active strontium in bone showed signs of rising greatly beyond thatcorresponding to one-hundredth of the maximum permissible occupationallevel. &quot; - &apos;   (Paragraphs 281-284.)War-time hazards361. The area in which a greater or lesser proportion of those exposedwould be at serious risk from the radiation produced by the ground burstof a thermonuclear weapon is measured in thousands of square miles. If asufficient number of nuclear weapons is exploded, no part of the world would escape biologically significant degrees of exposure or the load of distress and suffering to individuals and society which such exposurewould entail. (Paragraphs 286-290.)
CONCLUSIONS362. On the basis of the considerations in this report we feel justified indrawing the following conclusions in relation to the use of ionizing radiationsin peacetime :1. Limitation of the use of all sources of radiationAdequate justification should be required for the employment of any source of ionizing radiation on however small a scale.2. Dose levels to the individual(a) In conditions involving persistent exposure to ionizing radiations, thepresent standard, recommended by the International Commission onRadiological Protection, that the dose received shall not exceed 0-3 r weekly,averaged over any. period of 13 consecutive weeks, should, for the present,continue to be accepted.(b) During his whole lifetime, an individual should not be allowed to accumulate more than 200 r of &quot; whole-body &quot; radiation, in addition to thatreceived from the natural background, and this allowance should be spreadover tens of years ; but every endeavour should be made to keep the level ofexposure as low as possible.(c) An individual should not be allowed to accumulate more than 50 r of radiation to the gonads, in addition to that received from the natural back-ground, from conception to the age of 30 years ; and this allowance shouldnot apply to more than one-fiftieth of the total population of this country.3. Dose level to the populationThose responsible for authorising the development and use of sources ofionizing radiation should be advised that the upper limit, which futureknowledge may set to the total dose of extra radiation which may be receivedby the population as a whole, is not likely to be more than twice the dosewhich is already received from the natural background ; the recommendedfigure may indeed be appreciably lower than this.4. Fall-out from Test Explosions of Nuclear Weapons(a) The present and foreseeable hazards from external radiation due to fall-out from the test explosions of nuclear weapons, fired at the present rate and in the present proportion of the different kinds, are negligible.(b) Account must be taken, however, of the internal radiation from theradioactive strontium which is beginning to accumulate in bone. At itspresent level, no detectable increase in the incidence of ill-effects is to beexpected. Nevertheless, recognising all the inadequacy of our present know-ledge, we cannot ignore the possibility that, if the rate of firing increases andparticularly if greater numbers of thermonuclear weapons are used, we might,within the life-time of some now living, be approaching levels at which ill-effects might be produced in a small number of the population.5. Recommendations regarding specific uses of radiation(a) All sources of radiation, both medical and industrial, should be under close inspection, in order to ensure that the high standards of protection now
228attainable against the absorption of ionizing radiations, and against radio-active materials, are generally observed. Those using radiations should be instructed in the precautions to be taken, and no unnecessary or unauthorisedperson should be allowed to engage in such occupations. A personal record,not only of doses of radiation received during occupation but also ofexposures from all other sources, such as medical diagnostic radiology, shouldbe kept for all persons whose occupation exposes them to additional sources of radiation.(b) Present practice in medical diagnostic radiology should be reviewed,with the object of clarifying the indications for the different special types of examination now being carried out and defining more closely, both in relationto the patient and to the operators, the conditions which should be observed in their performance.(c) The uses of radiotherapy in non-malignant conditions should becritically examined.(d) The small amounts of irradiation from miscellaneous sources, such asX-ray machines used for shoe-fitting, luminous watches and clocks, and television apparatus, should be reduced as far as possible.6. Collection of Vital StatisticsAs an essential basis for future studies of the genetic effects of radiation,further data are required on the genetic structure of human populations ;to this end, there is an urgent need for the collection of more detailed information, when births, marriages and deaths are recorded.H.

The Incidence of Leukaemia among the Survivors of the Atomic BombExplosions at Hiroshima and NagasakiInformation concerning the cases of leukaemia which are known to have occurred among the survivors of the atomic bomb explosions at Hiroshimaand Nagasaki has been supplied by the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commissionof the American National Academy of Sciences. By the end of August 1955,the diagnosis of leukaemia had been confirmed in 125 patients; in all thesecases blood smears and, when necessary, bone-marrow and autopsy material,had been examined by a member of the Commission^ staff. In 18 other cases,the diagnosis was suspected but the evidence was less conclusive; and in afurther 5 the diagnosis was still under review.Sixty-one of the confirmed and four of the suspected cases occurred amongpersons resident in Hiroshima at the time the diagnosis was made, and it ispossible to relate these cases to the numbers of persons who survived the explosion and who were recorded as residing in the city subsequently. the incidence of leukaemia among survivors at various distances from the hypo-centre of the explosion is shown in Table 1 A. The incidence was substantially higher among those who&apos; were close to the hypocentre than among those whowere more distant from it 128-0 per 10,000 among those less than 1,000metres away, against 1-6 per 10,000 among those more than 3,000 metresaway. Separate incidence rates for persons at each distance who showedmajor radiation symptoms shortly after the explosion and for persons who didnot show such symptoms have been published by Moloney and Kastenbaum(1955).TABLE 1AThe incidence of leukaemia among survivors of the Hiroshima atomic bombexplosion exposed at various distances from the hypocentre; personssubsequently resident in Hiroshima City onlyDistance from hypocentre	No. of survivors	No. of cases of leukaemia		Incidence per 10,000at time of explosion (m.)	on 1.10.50*	Confirmed	Suspected	persons (total cases)Less than 1,000 1,000-1,499    ... 1,500-1,999    ...... 2,000-2,999    ...... 3,000 or more......	1,250 10,350 18,450 30,350 37,700	16 28 o 7 4	0 1 1 0 2	128-0 28-0 3-8 2-3 1 -6All distances   ...	98,100	61	4	6-6* The numbers of survivors have been rounded off to the nearest 50. The estimates differslightly from those published by Moloney and Kastenbaum (.1955) in accordance with dataprovided by the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission.Comparable figures are not available for the incidence of leukaemia in theunexposed population of the rest of Japan, but since leukaemia is invariablyfatal it is reasonable to use mortality figures to provide an estimate of the incidence of the disease which might have been expected if no explosion had
........ ,....................... ,\ Ci iAPPENDICES 85taken place. National mortality figures are, however, based on the causes of death given on death certificates, and they are not necessarily suitable forcomparison with figures obtained after an intensive search for cases and afterthe submission of each case to expert clinical scrutiny. In fact, the use ofnational mortality data is justified only by the fact that the number of deathsattributed to leukaemia among survivors who were 2,000 metres or more fromthe hypocentre and who cannot have received more than very small amounts of radiation, is close to the expected number calculated on the basis of thesedata. Table 2A therefore presents for comparison the numbers of cases ofleukaemia known to have occurred during the eight years from 1947 to 1954among residents of Hiroshima who survived at different distances from thehypocentre, and the numbers of deaths from leukaemia which would have been expected in a similar period among populations of the same size and the samesex- and age-distribution, subjected to the age- and sex-specific mortality ratesfrom leukaemia observed in the whole of Japan in 1952. It can be seen thatthe observed incidence among survivors who were less than 1,000 metresfrom the hypocentre is 100 times geater than the mortality which would havebeen expected.TABLE 2AA comparison between the observed and the expected incidence of leukaemiaamong survivors of the Hiroshima atomic bomb explosion exposedat various distances from the hypocentre; persons subsequentlyresident in Hiroshima City only	No. of cases with onset			Distance from	in the 8-year period		No. of deaths	Ratio ofhypocentre	1947-54		expected among	total casesat time of explosion			the survivors in	observed to(m.)			an 8-year period*	expected	Confirmed	Suspected		Less than 1,000	15	0	0-15	100-0 : 11,000-1,499    ......	28	1	1-32	22-0 : 11,500-1,999    ......	6	1	2-33	2-6 : 12,000-2,999    ......	6	0	3-96	1-5 : 13,000 or more......	4	2	4-83	1-2:1All distances  ...	59f	4	12-59	4-7 : 1* Calculated from the Japanese mortality data for 1952. In calculating the numbers ofexpected deaths, certain assumptions had to be made about the rate of change of the numbersof survivors in the different age groups, and the figures must be regarded as approximateestimates.t Two cases referred to in Table 1A are omitted, since the onset of symptoms in one patientwas in 1955 and in another patient, who died in April 1955, the date of onset is unknown;the latter patient was exposed at a distance of 2,400 metres from the hypocentre.The data available for survivors of the Nagasaki explosion are less detailedthan those for survivors of the Hiroshima explosion. Altogether 32confirmed cases and 11 suspected cases are known to have occurred amongsurvivors who subsequently resided in Nagasaki. Of these, 32 and 10respectively occurred during the eight years 1947-54, and the correspondingtotal number of deaths which might have been expected in that period on thebasis of the national mortality data is approximately 12-3.Table 3A shows the year of onset of the disease for each of the 108 cases which have occurred among the survivors resident post-war in Hiroshima orNagasaki, together with estimates of the annual incidence rates. The rates in
the first two years may be under-estimated, since medical organisation wasincomplete at that period; in 1953 and 1954 they are almost certainlyunder-estimated since new cases continue to be discovered and some of the patients give histories of one or more years&apos; duration. The data provide no evidence of a sharp peak in incidence at any particular period after the explosion, nor any clear indication that the incidence has yet begun to diminish by the end of the ninth year.TABLE 3AThe incidence of leukaemia in different years among survivors of theHiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb explosions; persons subsequentlyresident in Hiroshima City and Nagasaki only	No. of cases at		No. of cases at		Incidence per 10,000 persons			Hiroshima		Nagasaki			(total cases)	Year of							onset														Hiroshima	Confirmed	Suspected	Confirmed	Suspected	Hiroshima	Nagasaki	and							Nagasaki1946   ...	0	0	0	1	0 0	01	0-051947   ...	3	0	2	0	0-3	0-2	0-31948   ...	7	3	2	1	10	0-3	0-71949   ...	5	0	1	2	0-5	0-3	0-41950   ...	6	1	5	1	0-7	0-6	0-71951   ...	11	0	7&quot; &apos;	3	1-1	1-0	1-11952   ...	11	0	6	2	1 -1	0-8	1 01953   ...	10	0	2	1	1-0	0-3	0-71954   ...	6	0	7	0	0-6	0-7	0-part 1955							or  date									a		n			unknown	L	U	U	V			All years	61	4	32	ii	6-6	4-5	5-6							ReferenceMoloney, W.

231Leukaemia and a plastic Anaemia in Patients Treated with X-rays forAnkylosing Spondylitis(A summary of the findings of the investigation sponsored by the medical research Council Committee reporting on the hazards to man of nuclearand allied radiations)The investigation had two main objectives: first, to see whether the incidence of leukaemia and of a plastic anaemia was abnormally high in patientstreated with X-rays for ankylosing spondylitis ; and second, if the incidence of those conditions was found to be raised, to determine the quantitativerelationship between incidence and dose of X-rays.ResultsThe incidence of leukaemia and a plastic anaemiaThe case records of 13,352 patients (11,287 men and 2,065 women) werestudied ; these patients had been treated at 81 radiotherapy centres and sub-centres during the period 1935-54 inclusive. Slightly fewer than half of them were known to have been alive in 1955 or to have died earlier ; the remainder were lost to follow-up at various dates between 1935 and 1954.49 of the patients studied were found.to have developed leukaemia, aplasticanaemia, or myelofibrosis (a condition considered to be possibly a variantof leukaemia), and, of these, 46 had died by the end of 1955 ; 28 of them were certified as having died from leukaemia, 13 from a plastic anaemiaand 1 from myelofibrosis. Three other patients with leukaemia and 1 withaplastic anaemia were found, who had been certified as having died fromother causes.With the co-operation of the Registrars-General of England and wales and of Scotland, special efforts were made to recognise all patients in the series who had died of leukaemia or a plastic anaemia, The great majorityof such cases have probably been traced despite the incomplete follow-up,but there is reason to believe that a few more might be revealed if the follow-up could be made complete.The numbers of deaths from leukaemia and a plastic anaemia which couldbe expected under normal conditions were calculated from the national death-rates for those diseases in the general population ; they have been estimated as 2-9 and 0-3 respectively up to the end of 1955, but these estimates are certainly too high, as they are based on the assumption that all the patientsuntraced in 1955 were, in fact, alive at the end of 1955. In the calculation of the numbers of observed deaths from leukaemia and a plastic anaemiafor comparison with these figures, only deaths certified as due to these con-ditions could he used, since the figures for expected deaths are based ondeath-certificate data. Thus calculated, the numbers of observed deaths fromleukaemia and a plastic anaemia are respectively 28 and 13. The differences between the observed and expected deaths are highly significant for bothdiseases.
Three of the observed cases of leukaemia died within the first year, andin these cases it was assumed that leukaemia was already present at thetime of first treatment. If these &apos; co-existent&apos; cases, and the correspondingexpected mortality in the first year after treatment, are omitted, the observedand expected number of deaths from leukaemia for 1935-55 are 25 and 2-4respectively.Clinical review of casesAll the relevant data for each case were reviewed, and it was concluded that many of the patients certified as having died of a plastic anaemia had,in fact, been suffering from aleukaemic leukaemia. The diagnosis of aplasticanaemia was substantiated in only 4 cases and it was, therefore, not possibleto examine the relationship between the incidence of this condition and thedose of X-rays received.The relationship between the incidence of leukaemia and the X-ray doseThis relationship has been determined for male patients only, in order toavoid difficulties introduced by the possibility of there heing a sex-difference in susceptibility to leukaemia ; the 3 &apos; co-existent&apos; cases were excluded, andthere then remained 37 cases of leukaemia for study.Details of X-ray treatment were obtained from the case records for 1,864men, a sample of approximately 1 in 6 of the whole group of 11,287 malepatients. The X-ray dose was expressed in two ways. By the first method,the total energy absorbed in the whole body was calculated, and expressedin megagramme-roentgens (most.r.); by the second, the maximum dosein the spinal marrow was determined and expressed in roentgens (r)*. Thenumber of man-years at risk following each level of dose, calculated by eachof the two methods, was estimated for the whole group of male patients and was related to the number of cases of leukaemia. The results of these calculations are given in Tables IB and 2B, which show the crude incidencerates per 10,000 men per year at all levels of dose.TABLE IBThe numbers of male patients developing leukaemia and the crude incidencerates after different doses of radiation (measured by the total amount of energy absorbed by the whole body)Amount of treatment: whole-body integral dose (most.r.)	0	Less than .5	5-9	10-14	15-24	25-34	35 or moreNumber of men develop-ing leukaemia	-, .	i ;.	9	9	10	4	4Crude incidence per 10,000 men per year ...	0-5t	0-7	4-7	5-2	11-3	22-3	62-1* For the second method extensive measurements were made on a &apos; phantom&apos; man.t The rate given for &apos; no treatment&apos; has been estimated from the national vital statisticsfor all forms of leukaemia, and weighted to allow for the fact that not all the patients in the series were certified as dying from leukaemia. If lymphatic leukaemia is excluded (as may bemore appropriate) the rate is 0-3.

If lymphatic leukaemia is excluded (as may bemore appropriate) the rate is 0-3.ConclusionsDeaths from leukaemia have been found to be greatly increased amongthe patients studied, and it is believed that this increase is the result ofexposure to X-rays ; the possibility that sufferers from ankylosing spondylitisare unusually sensitive to the action of X-rays cannot, however, be excluded.Both methods of estimating the dose show a relationship between the crudeincidence of leukaemia and the dose of X-rays, with an increase in the incidence over the whole range of dose studied. With neither method is there any evidence of a threshold below which no increase in incidence is produced. Both sets of results, therefore, suggest that even very small amounts of radiation will have appreciable effect if given to a large enough popula-tion. The method based on calculation of the whole-body energy absorption,however, shows a disproportionately greater increase at high levels of dose,whereas that based on calculation of the spinal-marrow dose shows a simpleproportional increase at all levels of dose. It is of considerable importanceto.determine the reason for this discrepancy. If the true relationship is ofthe curvilinear type suggested by the first method, it remains a theoreticalpossibility that very small doses (which could not be tested in the investi-gation) will have no leukaemogenic effect at all; but such a possibility canalmost be ruled out if the relationship is linear.A full account of the investigation will be published by H.M. stationery office as a report in the Medical Research Councils Special Report Series.W.

The Spontaneous Mutation Rate in ManIn certain circumstances the spontaneous mutation rate of human genes,expressed, as the number of mutations per locus per generation, can beestimated with a fair degree of reliability. A direct count of cases due tofresh mutation can be made for a gene which has a dominant effect. this number can also be directly inferred for sex-linked traits shown only in the male. If the incidence of a trait in the general population is known, themutation rate can be determined from the proportion of cases due to freshmutation.When the effects of a gene are very disadvantageous a different line of argument can be used, even though the gene may not be fully manifest inthe heterozygous state. The principles on which the indirect estimation -ofmutation rates can be made were laid down by Haldane (1932), and they are used in the formulae given in Appendix D. The assumption is made that the human population is in a state approaching genetical equilibrium; it issupposed that disadvantageous genes could not have persisted in the popula-tion unless their extinction by selective mortality were balanced -by therecurrence of mutation.In the case of dominant or sex-linked characters associated with very highmortality, the direct measurement of mutation rate can be supplemented bythe indirect argument. Estimates which are entirely indirect are untrust-worthy, but they have been made for a variety of genes recognised only bytheir recessive effects. One difficulty with recessive traits is that allowance has to be made for the effects of inbreeding. Another likely source of erroris that genetical equilibrium can be maintained not only by mutation but also by a slightly advantageous effect in the heterozygote. Hence, indirect estimates are likely to be too high.There is a further general difficulty ; this arises from uncertainty as towhether or not a single locus is involved in determining the trait underconsideration. Mutations at two or three loci might produce similar charac-ters ; this apparently occurs in haemophilia and also in achondroplasia. Inthese circumstances any estimate of mutation frequency, direct or indirect,based upon accepting one locus as the hereditary cause of the trait, wouldbe too high by a factor depending upon the frequencies of the componentcausal genes.Estimates of mutation rate in man are given in Table 1C. Those fordominant traits are based upon the direct method, though they can all beindirectly supported; the estimates for sex-linked genes are calculatedindirectly, but are supported by direct observation of pedigrees almost certainly containing freshly mutated genes ; those for recessive traits are allindirectly estimated.

This can be done by using the indirect method ofcalculating mutation rate; the steps in the argument are set out in Table ID.The abnormal allele is represented by a, and the normal by A.TABLE ID
In this table three hereditary diseases, achondroplasia, haemophilia andphenylketonuria are used to show the methods applicable respectively todominant, sex-linked and recessive traits determined by single genes. Forthe present purpose the population is assumed to be in genetical equilibrium ;the loss due to unfitness of genotypes is balanced by recurrent naturalmutation. The figures per achondroplasia are derived from M0rch (1941);in Step 3, 1/9,400 has been rounded off to 1/10,000. For haemophilia thefigure in Step 4/(7/8) has been taken from Andreassen (1943) and that inStep 3 (1/12,000) agrees with estimates by Haldane (1935). The figures inSteps 3 and 4 for phenylketonuria are derived from Jervis (1939) and Munro(1947). Doubling the mutation rate on one occasion would increase the frequency of each disease by a proportion, shown in Step 6, in the nextgeneration.The results given in Step 7 (ii) in Table ID apply only to the firstgeneration after doubling. The quantitative effects in subsequent generationscan be ascertained by substituting appropriate new incidence figures andrepeating the steps of the calculation. Calculations made by this method and extended to cover six generations, yield the results shown in Table 2D ;the theoretical limiting values obtained after an infinite number of genera-tions are also given. The results are shown graphically in Fig. 1 (p. 00).Two situations are considered: (a) the effect of a single doubling of mutationrates in one generation, and (b) the effect of permanently doubling themutation rate.TABLE 2DThe effects, expressed as the increase in incidence per hundred cases,of doubling the mutation rates (a) in one generation only, and (b)permanently, for three hereditary traits(a) Doubling in one generation onlyIncrease in incidence per hundred casesNumber of generations	Achondroplasia	Haemophilia	Phenylketonuria (Recessive)	(Dominant)	(Sex-linked)	0        .........	0	0	01        .........	80	29	12        .........	16	29	13        .........	3	16	14        .........	1	10	15        .........	0	6	16        .........	0	4	1Infinite       .........	0	0	0

There are many degrees of severity, and males are more often affected than females. The genetical predisposition occurs insubjects who are, according to Kallmann (1938), homozygous for a specificrecessive gene ; it has an incidence of about 1/100 in European populations(Fremming, 1947). On the basis of a rough survey of hospital data, it is assumed here that only one-tenth of predisposed subjects become chronicallyincapacitated. Neglecting sex differences, the fertility of these incapacitatedpatients is reduced by 1/2 (Essen-Moller, 1935). The total loss of fitness ofpredisposed genotypes is thus 1/10 x 1/2 = 1/20. It follows thatd ^ 2q(l-F) 1/100, as shown in Table IE. In a generation of 20 x 106births the number of incapacitated people would be 20,000, of whom 200would be due to fresh mutation.
(ii) Manic depressive reactionThis is a type of mental disease with mean age of onset at about 40 years.There are many degrees of severity, and females are more often affected thanmales. The genetical predisposition, which is commonly believed to depend upon a dominant gene (Marrell, 1951), has a frequency in the population ofabout 1/200; Mayer-Gross, Slater and Roth (1954) quote 0-35 per cent for Scotland and 1 per cent for Sweden and Denmark as the total morbidityrisk of affective psychosis. The incidence of chronic breakdown among thosewho are predisposed can be estimated at one-seventh and, for such incapaci-tated patients, fertility is reduced, according to observations by Essen-Moller,by a factor of 1 /10. Hence the total loss of fitness for predisposed genotypesis 1/7 x 1/10 ^ 1/70. It follows that d = (1-F) = 1/70. In a generation of 20 x 106 births there would be 14,000 people incapacitated, of whom 200would be due to fresh mutation.ReferencesEssen-Moller, E. (1935).

The Effect of Changing the Mutation Rate on Characters showingContinuous Variation about the NormalMember genes of a polygenic system cannot be followed as individuals inour observations. We must therefore measure mutation by the increment itadds to heritable variation, instead of measuring it by the frequency of change,as is done in the case of individually traceable genes.The increment added to the variance per generation has been estimated forspontaneous mutation in two hair characters in Drosophila (Clayton andRobertson, 1955 ; Durrant and Mather, 1954 ; Paxman, 1955). Technicallythis is a difficult operation, but the estimates agree surprisingly well for eachcharacter when allowance is made for various possible sources of bias. Thetwo characters agree, also, in showing an increment of about 1 x 10-3 ofthe amount of heritable variation estimated by Clayton and Robertson to be present in a normal population of Drosophila. The estimate may easily be too small by a fraction of 2 or 3, but seems unlikely to be out by a factor of 10. This finding suggests that the relation between the amount of heritablevariation in a population and the mutation rate is roughly linear, and certaintheoretical considerations point the same way. It also shows that a marked increase in the mutation rate for a few generations would have only a trivialeffect on the heritable variation of the population, and that, even with apersistent increase, the new equilibrium showing the full effect of the raisedmutation rate in raising heritable variation would take very many generationsto achieve.Clayton and Robertson also record the result of irradiating the adults ofeach generation with an X-ray dose of 1,800 r. The increment added in eachgeneration to the heritable variation available to selection was about ten times the spontaneous increment. Thus the dose which doubles the effect ofspontaneous mutation would be some 200 r as measured by this criterion.But the new heritable variation available to selection in these experimentsseems to have represented only about one-sixth of all the new heritablevariation as measured directly by the increase in phenotypic variation. If we take the overall total therefore, 200 r must have produced about six times thespontaneous increment, so that the doubling dose becomes just over 30 r.This is more in keeping with the figure obtained from lethal mutation, thoughit might have been expected that the polygenic figure would be higher, notlower, than the monogenic, because of the way in which mutations can balanceone another&apos;s effects in a polygenic system. It would, in any case, be unwise toplace great confidence in these calculations, both because other experimentsof the same kind have given results even more difficult to assess, and becausedoses as heavy as 1,800 r produce so many lethal mutations and so muchstructural change in the chromosomes that the polygenic effects may well bequantitatively distorted.In attempting to extrapolate from these findings to the effects of irradiationin natural, including human, populations, two points must be borne in mind.Firstly, the flies which yielded these observations were from inbred lines,so that any mutation in the polygenic system would add its quota to theincrease in variation. In a natural population, however, variation is alreadypresent, and mutation from one allele to another where both already exist
237K. Matherare not uncommon in the population could add little if anything to the variation. Only mutation in genes whose alleles are rare or absent in thepopulation will contribute materially to an increase in variation, and the contribution will fall off as the alternative alleles become more common. so if most of the member genes of a polygenic system are already varying,mutation will add correspondingly little to the total variation. On the otherhand, if, as seems likely, many of the genes which can prospectively contribute to the variation of a polygenic system are not doing so because only one alleleis present or at least common, new mutation increases the number of locicontributing to the variation which will then increase correspondingly. Theroughly linear relation between mutation and variation suggested by the experiments is thus to be regarded as a maximum effect, the closeness of approach to it depending on the initial conditions of variation prevailing inthe population in question.The second point concerns the properties of heterozygotes. The linearrelation would cease to hold if there were any innate advantage of individualsheterozygous for the genes over others homozygous for them. A situationanalogous to balanced polymorphism would then arise, and at equilibriumthe heritable variation would become independent of mutation rate. No suchheterozygotic advantage was detected in the variation arising by mutation,even though Paxman made a special search for it; nor is it likely on general grounds. Such an advantage must, however, remain as a possible, even ifunlikely, additional reason for regarding a linear relation as representingthe maximum, rather than the regularly realizable, effect of mutation onvariation in populations such as those of man. In other words a permanentdoubling of the mutation rate would not be expected to do more, and under some circumstances might do less, than double the heritable variation in thepopulation.ReferencesClayton, G. and Robertson, A.

The Effect on the Distribution of Intelligence of Increasing theHeritable VariationUnder conditions of natural selection the effect of raising the heritable, and hence the total, variation of expression of a character, some particularexpression of which is the fittest, must in general be to lower the averagefitness in the population ; (though where the mean departs widely from themost advantageous expression of the character the fitness of selected groupsmight be raised). Furthermore, where all expressions of the character maybe displayed, the overall fall in fitness must be directly related to the increasein variation. A fall in fitness is not, however, to be translated directly intosocial load when we are considering the consequences of raising the heritablevariation in such a character as mental capacity in man.The intelligence score of an individual is derived from his performance ina series of tests, and the frequency distribution obtained from a populationmust therefore reflect the structure of the tests. The distribution obtained isgenerally treated as being normal, but in fact certain disturbances occasion-ally appear, and they seem to be of a type which no simple transformationor statistical adjustment can remove. It is very likely that such discrepanciesspring from innate features of the test, and they should not, in any case,be allowed to obscure the broadly normal nature of the distribution. Normalitywill in fact be assumed in the following discussion. It is considered that byavoiding the use of very narrow ranges and, more particularly, by discussingrelative rather than absolute effects, broadly valid conclusions should be attained.I am informed by Professor F. A. Peel of the Department of education in the University of Birmingham, that in educational discussions the distri-bution of intelligence scores is taken as normal and is standardised to amean of 100 with a standard deviation of 15. The scores have been foundto approximate to I.Q.&apos;s as measured by the original tests, and are commonlyreferred to as &apos; I.Q. scoresIn these terms, Professor Peel further informsme, children with an I.Q. of less than 70 are generally regarded as educa-tionally sub-normal and as requiring education in special schools ; those with an I.Q. of between 70 and 80 are regarded as needing special teachingin ordinary schools ; and those with an I.Q. of over 115 as being of grammarschool quality. These figures are to be taken only as general guides since they are applied neither rigorously nor uniformly throughout the country.For information and advice on the estimation of the heritable variation in respect of I.Q. I am indebted to Dr. J. A. Fraser Roberts. Sibs show acorrelation close to 05 in this character. Data on parent-offspring relations were less full, but suggest a similar figure, so that there is no good reasonto postulate any over-dominance or heterozygous advantage. Taken on theirface value, such figures would indicate virtually complete genetic determina-tion, but there is strong assortative mating in respect of this character andthere is also the effect of a common home environment to be taken intoaccount in assessing the genetic meaning of these familial correlations.Observations on twins and foster children would seem to indicate J as thefraction of variation which is heritable. However, lest this should be an over-estimate, parallel calculations have been made, assuming fractions of ^and J as likely to straddle the true situation. Should even the figure of \ be too high the effect of increasing the heritable component would be corre-correspondingly smaller. Assortative mating has been disregarded, as we may

Thus, taking VH to be J of the totalvariation (VT) we have:Vh^V^J x 152, andVE^VT-VH-ixl52,so that doubling the heritable variation would give us the new total:VT^V^2VH-(ix 152H(2xfx 152)^ If x 225 = 393-75and the new distribution of I.Q. would have a standard deviation of 1984,the mean remaining at 100. The proportion of individuals expected to have,for example, an I.Q. of less than 70 can then be found as the area in the tailof the distribution cut off by the ordinate falling short of the mean by a30normal deviate of ir. 0. ^512.19-84The results of this and similar calculations are shown in Table 1G, wherethey are expressed as values relative to the proportion calculated as falling into corresponding classes with the distribution as it is now assumed to be.Thus the assumed present distribution 0^=100, s -15) gives 2-27 per cent of individuals with an I.Q. of less than 70. With the heritable fraction at fof the total and doubled, 6-53 per cent fall below a score of 70, making a6 * 53relative value of 272^=2-88. In other words, on these assumptions, doubling the heritable variation would nearly treble the number of children with anI.Q. of less than 70 (i.e. those needing to be taught in special schools, asjudged by a common convention of today). In addition to the relative changesin the numbers with an I.Q. of less than 70, figures are also given for thosein the classes with I.Q. less than 75 (a figure sometimes taken to indicate theneed for special schooling), I.Q. between 70 and 80 (special teaching), andI.Q. over 115 (grammar school).
In these calculations the variance has been assumed to change withoutalteration of the mean, so that the proportion of high I.Q. increases with theproportion of low I.Q. A further calculation has been made in which, as thevariance increases, the mean is allowed to fall so as to keep constant theproportion with I.Q.&apos;s of over 115. This is intended to illustrate the kind ofresult which would be obtained if mutation were preponderantly, but not wholly degradatory. The relative changes for doubled heritable variation onthis assumption are also shown in the table.It should be remembered that these changed proportions would be achieved by corresponding increases in the mutation rate, only when equilibrium hadbeen reached, or at least closely approached, that is to say, after very manygenerations.K. Mather.
The Doubling Dose of Radiation for Various Plants and AnimalsIn paragraphs 171-182 we were concerned with finding some quantitativemeasure of the effectiveness of radiation in causing mutations, with thepurpose of using this estimate to establish maximum levels of exposure whichare genetically tolerable. In this context, one must be particularly careful notto under-estimate the effects of radiation. In order to express its influence interms of a &apos; doubling dose&apos;, we should try to arrive at a figure for the lowestdose of radiation which changes mutation in a way which is effectivelyequivalent to a doubling of the mutation rates of every gene. For those geneswith very low spontaneous mutation rates, a doubling of the rate will be relatively unimportant. Among the genes with relatively greater spontaneousmutation rates, some may be more sensitive to radiation than others. what we need to estimate is the dose of radiation which doubles the mutation rateof a sample of these more sensitive genes sufficiently large to be physiologi-cally representative of mutations in general. This might be called a &apos; minimumrepresentative doubling dose&apos;.After pointing out (paragraph 176) that this can scarcely be less than thenaturally occurring dose of radiation, we discuss the possible modifications ofthis bedrock minimum in terms of an argument which was originally largely due to J. B. S. iHaldane (1948). This consists of an attempt to estimate thefraction of the spontaneous mutation rate in man which can plausibly be attributed to natural radiation. The argument proceeds by analogy with theconditions in other organisms, and particularly those in the fruit-fly(Drosophila) and the mouse.In Drosophila, suppose that:j^the fraction of spontaneous mutations due to natural radiation,r^the rate of natural radiation (in r per day),/?^the rate of mutation induced by 1 r,s^he spontaneous mutation rate,t^the average age at reproduction (in days).Then we shall have: &apos;&quot; - -Similarly if capital letters represent the same factors in man, we shall haveNow the spontaneous mutation rate and the rate of induced mutation (s andm) are much better known for flies than for man (S and M). Thus, theprocedure is to arrive at F by first finding as good a value as possible for /and then modifying this according to the relation,m r state =MR TSM RTsm r t S
In his original presentation of the argument, Haldane adopted for / a value(0-001) which had been calculated by D. E. Lea (1946). However, it has recentlybeen pointed out (Spiers, 1956) that Lea based his calculation on an estimateof natural radiation of 2-2 milliroentgen (mr)per day, which is about eighttimes greater than that accepted at the present time (paragraph 200). Thevalue for / has to be reduced accordingly. For the sake of simplicity we havetaken it as 0-0001 (paragraph 178), although this may be a slight under-estimate.This value for / is based on an estimate of 0-15 per cent sex-linked lethals.Lea argues, in agreement with other authors who have considered the matter,that there may be about 1,000 genes capable of mutating to sex-linked lethalsin Drosophila; his value for the spontaneous mutation rate can therefore be expressed as L5X10-6 per locus. The statement (paragraph 178) that the human spontaneous mutation rate is probably at least five times as great as this is based on the observation that the mutation rates of several humangenes are around 10 per million per generation (of. Table 1C).The opinion (paragraph 179) that mouse genes are more sensitive toradiation than those of Drosophila (he. have a higher value for m) is basedon the work of W. L. Russell (1954). It is disputed by some authors; but if one adopts it, and takes it to suggest the hypothesis that human genes arealso more sensitive, the result is to increase the value of F, and thus to lower the estimate of the minimum representation doubling dose. In order to be ascautious as possible, we have therefore adopted these assumptions.The estimate (paragraph 185) that one human germ cell in ten carries anew mutation is a minimum figure arrived at in calculations by H. J. Muller(1950, 1954).Some typical figures for doubling doses derived from experiments on plantsand animals are given in Table 1H. These figures are open to a wide margin of statistical error, as the number of spontaneous mutations was alwayssmall; in most instances values smaller or larger by a factor of 2 are not excluded.There have been many other reports of experiments in which mutationswere induced by ionizing radiations, especially in plants and lower organisms ;however, in the great majority of these either the control series was too smallfor any spontaneous mutation to be observed, or the apparent mutants foundwere not confirmed by genetic test. The figures quoted here are probablyrepresentative.References(a) TextHaldane, J. B. S. (1948). The formal genetics of man. (Croonian Lecture.) Proc. roy. Soc,Scr. B.   135, 147.Lea, D. E. (1946).

24The Dose of Radiation Received in Human Tissues from Natural SourcesAll living organisms absorb ionizing radiation from sources which are eitherpresent in their environment or incorporated in their own tissues. The mostimportant &apos; external&apos; radiations are cosmic rays and the radiations arisingfrom elements of the uranium and thorium series present in the earth or theair and from the potassium 40 content of the earth and of vegetable matter.The &apos; internal&apos; irradiation arises chiefly from the potassium in tissues, butthere is also a small contribution from carbon 14 and in some cases softtissues within bone receive radiation from very small amounts of radiumpresent in the skeleton. Radon in the atmosphere, besides contributing itsquota to the external radiation, may also add to the internal dose, by accessof the radioactive material to the tissues via the lungs. Because alpha raysand beta rays are so readily absorbed, even by the elements of low atomicnumber which comprise the soft tissues, the dose from external sources maybe regarded as entirely due to cosmic rays and gamma rays. The dose frominternally absorbed radioactive materials, however, arises in large measurefrom beta rays and, when present, from alpha rays.The radiation &quot;dose to human tissues from this normal background is smallcompared with doses known to cause immediate somatic change, and itssignificance is presumably to be sought in possible long-term effects ; of these the genetic and carcinogenic actions of ionizing radiation would appear to bethe most likely. The critical tissues considered in this appendix are, therefore,the gonads and the osteocytes of the Haversian systems in bone. An estimateof the dose to these tissues is made as far as present data allow, and although this is attempted for a number of different localities, it must be emphasised that knowledge of the basic data is far from complete.All doses are expressed as soft-tissue doses in rads, and where calculationshave involved the quantity &apos; W,&apos; the energy per ion-pair formed in air, a value of 34 eV has been taken as representative of recent experimentaldeterminations of that constant.SOURCES OF EXTERNAL RADIATIONCosmic raysThe cosmic ray ionization intensity in air at sea-level (and geomagneticlatitudes above 410 N) has been variously quoted in the literature over a range of from 1-5 to 2-8 ion pairs/cc/sec. The differences have arisen largely in the interpretation of high-pressure ionization-chamber measurements, andthe correct method of analysis appears to be that used by Clay and hisco-workers (1938), and re-examined and supported by further experimentsby Burch (1954). The mean of three values given by these workers andcorrected to ionization in free air is 1-92 ions/cc/sec. Converting this value to a tissue dose gives:  cosmic ray dose-rate to soft tissues = 0-028 rad/year.&apos;This dose-rate applies to any soft tissues in the body, including the gonadsand osteocytes, and is typical for most locations at the earth&apos;s surface abovelatitude 410 N. It may be some 20 per cent less in basements of tall buildings which absorb the &apos; soft&apos; cosmic ray component; but any considerable

At aheight of 10,000 ft. the cosmic ray dose-rate is increased by a factor of 3 ormore, but it will be seen later that cosmic rays contribute only a fraction ofthe total tissue-dose, and that, in consequence, the tissue dose-rate at thisheight might be only some 40 per cent greater than at sea-level.The dose-rate of 0-028 rad/year is less than the figure 0-035 rad/year, given,for example, by Libby (1955). For the reasons given above, the lower figureappears to be the correct one and is retained in the present analysis. It is amatter of some discussion whether or not the small component of slowparticles in cosmic radiation has a higher RJB.E. than the fast-meson com-ponent, the R.B.E. of which has been taken as unity. Some mutations are reported as being less effectively produced by heavily ionizing particles ;in a few other cases the R.B.E. for heavy particles has been found to be the region of 5. In the extreme case, the slow-particle component would not appearlikely to add as much as 0-01 rad/year to the effective cosmic ray dose. Onthe other hand, some shielding of the soft gamma ray component of thecosmic radiation by building structures occurs, which reduces the dose belowthe unshielded value. It would seem best, in view of this and the possible effect of a higher R.B.E., to accept the unshielded value of 0-028 rad/year asthe best estimate for sea-level and latitudes above 4T N.Local gamma raysUnder most conditions of life, gamma radiation from local surroundingsis responsible for the greater fraction of the external radiation dose.Measurement of this contribution, however, has been made in comparativelyfew places.Some measurements of local gamma ray dose-rates in Leeds and Aberdeen(Spiers and Griffith, 1956) are summarised in Table 1J. The results coveronly limited types of situation, but the concordance between the dose-ratesin brick and concrete buildings, whether in Leeds or in Aberdeen, suggeststhat they may be fairly representative of the dose-levels in areas which arenot specially radioactive and in buildings not made of granite. The dose-ratesin Leeds, determined with a lightly-shielded counter, are about 20 per cent higher than the background measurements previously reported, but this effect was shown to be due to the difference in shielding in the two measure-ments. The results in Table 1J represent the local gamma ray dose-rates under conditions of light shielding.TABLE 1 JMeasurements of local gamma ray dose-rates in Leeds and Aberdeen

Taking the counting rate given by Peirson for a &apos; normal&apos;background situation, and allowing for the cosmic ray fraction, a countingrate of about l-3 cts/min. per cm.2 of projected cathode area is deductedfor this &apos; normal&apos; local radiation. Assuming an over-all efficiency of the counter assembly of 06 per cent, and a mean gamma ray energy of 1 MeV,a gamma ray flux is deducted which corresponds to a tissue dose-rate of1&apos;05 rad/year, a figure reasonably in accord with measurements in Leedsand in Sweden away from areas of high radioactivity. Applying the sameanalysis to the recorded counting rate in St. Ives and its neighbourhood, thelocal gamma ray dose-rate is deduced as approximately 0 25 rad/year. Greataccuracy cannot be claimed for this estimation in view of the assumptionsmade, but it is of the same order as the values given in Table 2J for areasof known high radioactivity in Sweden. Dose-rates of 0-3 rad/year and overhave been reported in some parts of Cornwall (Wood and Willey, 1954).Atmospheric radonRadiation from the break-down products of atmospheric radon also add to the external gamma ray dose. This effect may be expected to be smallunder most conditions, but so far no measurements have been made to distinguish its contribution from that of gamma rays from the solid sur-roundings, Peirson and Franklin (1951) have calculated that at ground levelan atmospheric-radon content of 3 x 10-13 c/1 produces a gamma ray fluxof the order of 10 quanta/cm.2,/min. Taking a mean energy of 0-8 MeV forradium B and C gamma rays, the tissue dose-rate for this flux is 0-0022rad/year. Anderson, Mayneord and Turner (1954) have reported levels ofatmospheric radon in London (in May 1953) which averaged 2-3 x 10-12 c/1,and under these conditions the external gamma ray dose from atmosphericradon is of the order 0-02 rad/year a contribution of nearly the samemagnitude as that due to cosmic rays.Sievert and Hultqvist (1952) and Sievert (1955) have reported measure-ments of the total &apos; cosmic ray plus gamma ray&apos; background in Swedishhouses and in out-of-door situations. Some of the Swedish results are givenin Table 2J where an allowance has first been made for the cosmic rayfraction and the residual ionization converted to tissue dosage. The meandose-rates recorded were based on measurements in about 70 houses.Variations in dose-rate were most marked in Type 3 houses where, in some,values 50 to 100 per cent above the mean in Table 2J were recorded.TABLE 2J
SOURCES OF INTERNAL RADIATIONPotassium 40The following data have been used in the calculation of the dose-rate fromthe potassium content of the body:  Mean potassium-content of body ^ 0-215 per centSpecific / -activity of K = 27-4 /?&apos;s/sec./g. KSpecific y-activity of K - 3 - 5 yr&apos;s/sec./g. KMean A-ray energy of K 40 - 0 - 605 MeVMean y-ray energy of K 40 = 1 -46 MeVBecause the mean range of the beta particles of potassium 40 is only some mm., the dose-rate in a given organ is determined mainly by its ownpotassium content. In the absence of precise values for the potassium content of the gonads, the mean for the whole body, derived from ShohTs data (1939)is adopted. The total tissue dose-rate derived from the energy released per g.of tissue, is then :  tissue dose-rate due to K = 0-018(A) -f- 0-002(y) ^ 0-020 rad/year.In relation to this calculation there may be doubt as to the precise value for the potassium content of the gonads. So far it has only been possible tomake fiame-photometric measurements on tissues taken from two postmortem examinations. The results, obtained through the kind co-operationof Dr. F. M. Parsons of the Urological Department of the General Infirmaryat Leeds, are as follows:  Potassium SodiumCase and age                         content content(m.g./100g.) (mg./100-g.)A. 67 yr.

(i)        188 200(ii)         197 204Three results are concordant and one (A(ii)) is suspect in that the sodiumvalue is so low. They suggest, however, that no great error is being madein assuming an average potassium content of 0215 per cent, as given byShohl. The tissues were taken from the central parts of the gonads, and thepotassium content should be representative of the average value overdimensions of a few mm. of the tissues containing the germ cells.Carbon 14Carbon in living systems contains approximately 1 part carbon 14 in 1012,and has a specific beta ray emission of 0-2 beta particles per sec per g. carbon,with a mean energy of 0-053 MeV. Taking the carbon content of tissue as18 per cent, the energy deposition due to the carbon 14 amounts to a tissuedose-rate of only 0-001 rad/year.Radon and its disintegration productsAn estimation of tissue dose arising from the inhalation of air containingradon can be made if, in the absence of complete information on all the factors concerned, some simplifying assumptions are made. The concentra-tion of radon in the atmosphere is regarded as uniform, and it is assumed that the break-down products (radium A, B, C and C1) are in equilibriumwith the radon and are uniformly suspended in the air. The calculation is then made in two parts: (1) for a steady level of radon (plus disintegration

If the concentration of pure radon in alveolar airis C, and is regarded for the moment as free of disintegration products, the concentration of radon in the 50 kg. of aqueous tissue will be 0T7 C andthat in the 10 kg. of fatty tissue will be 0-85 C, giving a mean for the wholesoft tissues (63 kg.) of 0-27 C. This level of radon in the tissues is main-tained, and hence it will maintain its disintegration products in equilibriumwith it. Taking the effective disintegration energy of the series as 20 MeV,and assuming an atmospheric-radon content of 3 x 10-13 c/1 (as above) the energy deposition per g. of tissue corresponds to a dose-rate of only 3 x 10-5rad/year, mainly of alpha radiation. Using an R.B.E. of 10 to enable thisalpha dose-rate to be added to the beta and gamma dose-rates alreadycalculated, the tissue dose-rate for the dissolved radon is 3 x 10-4 rem/year.The dose-rate from the disintegration products formed in the atmosphereand subsequently inhaled can be calculated on an assessment of the fate ofthe products retained. If the products are insoluble in body fluids, little ifany irradiation of the gonads could occur from inhalation; if soluble, a fraction of the retained products (the retained fraction in lungs and respiratorytract is 75 per cent, I.C.R.P., 1955) would be generally disseminated in thebloodstream. The calculation has been based on the assumption that 20 percent of the inhaled disintegration products are effective in irradiating general body tissues, and an exact formula has been used in calculating the equilibrium energy dissipation. The total dose-rate to soft tissues due to theinhalation of air containing 3 x 10-13 c/1 of radon plus disintegration productsis then 19 milliren per year.The total dose-rate to soft tissues due to the inhalation of air containing3 x 10-13 c/1 of radon plus disintegration products might be expected, there-fore, to be about 0-0022 rem/year. At the radon concentration of 3x 10-12c/1 reported by Anderson et al, (1954) for London air the dose-rate thuscalculated would be 0-022 rem/year, i.e. a figure comparable with the cosmicray background.Total dose-rate to the gonadsBefore summarising the total gonad-dose from all sources the effect ofbody-shielding on the local gamma ray dose should be considered. Measure-ments have now been made of this shielding factor by using a water-filled tinmodel. A thin-walled tube was fixed in the trunk so that a small geiger-counter could be positioned at the site of an ovary. The counter was placedTABLE 3J
outside the trunk to assume representative positions for the testes. Measure-ments were made in a laboratory (sitellfb) in Table 1J) where the backgroundwas known to be steady. The cosmic ray response of the counter was allowed for by measurements made inside a cubicle shielded by a minimum thicknessof 9 in. of steel. The screening factors for horizontal, sitting, and standingpostures are given in Table 3J.The correction for the cosmic ray component inside the building could onlybe estimated approximately, but if this were in error by as much as i 100per cent it would produce errors in the screening factor of not more than - 8or + 4 per cent. In the male, the factor varies with the position assumed butby not more than i 8 per cent. The average ratio for the two sexes should notbe in error, therefore, by as much as +10 per cent.Summary of dose-rates to the gonadsTable 4J summarises dose-rates which may be regarded as typical forregions in this country and possibly elsewhere, where the local rock radio-activity is not specially high, and the buildings are of brick or concreteconstruction not incorporating specially radioactive materials such as graniteor granite chips. In arriving at the dose-rates a gonad shielding factor of 0-63has been assumed, and the local gamma ray dose is averaged for an assumed8 hours* out-of-doors and 16 hours indoors.TABLE 4JDose-rates to the gonads for a region of &apos; normal&apos; ground radioactivityRadiation source	Dose to gonads per year (jad)External radiation Cosmic rays (sea level)      ..................

Estimates aregiven for two radon-in-air concentrations but it is not known whether levelsas high as 3 x 10-12 c/1 persist for long periodsIt should be noted that higher dose-rates and greater differences betweenlocalities could be obtained by taking the extreme values observed in someof the Stockholm and Aberdeen sites, but an attempt has been made to assessas far as possible the conditions affecting large numbers of people. Thusbecause even agricultural workers spend probably 8 hours per day or more* This is a maximum figure and is probably an over-estimate.

The body-shielding factor of 0-63 considerablyreduces the difference otherwise apparent in situations of differing localradioactivity.DOSAGE IN BONEConsideration should be given to the problem of dosage in bone fromnatural sources, in order that the significance of the ingestion of bone-seekingradioactive isotopes may be properly assessed. The dose-rate to osteocyteshas been estimated, therefore, by a summation of the dose-rate from sourcesexternal to the bone and that from radium deposited in the skeleton itself.Dose from sources external to boneThe dose-rates to osteocytes from the sources considered above will notbe very different from the tissue-doses already calculated. The dose-rate frompotassium 40 will be less, because the potassium content of the bone is only about one-quarter of that for the body as a whole. The dose-rate from inhaledatmospheric radon and its products may also be expected to be greatly reduced, because even if the radioactive content of an osteocyte from thesesources were the same as that deduced for soft tissues, the alpha particleswould leave only a small fraction of their energy in the osteocyte itself.The reduced dose-rate to osteocytes for the conditions assumed in Table 4Jmight be put at about 0-08 rem/year.Dose from radium in boneThe most likely value for the radium content of the skeleton for a regionnot exceptionally high in radioactivity would appear to be the mean content of 1-2 x 10-10 g. Measured by Hursh and Gates (1950) for subjects inRochester, New York, U.S.A., where the radium content of drinking-wateris given as 0-6 x 10-16 g./cc. If the skeletal radium is proportional to theradium level in drinking-water, the measured level of 1-1 x 10-15 g./cc. fortap water in St. Ives (Gleuckauf and Jacobi, 1953) would imply a body radiumcontent of 2-2 x 10-9 g. Swedish waters are known to have very much higherradium contents, implying body radium contents approaching .10-7 g., butmeasurements of body gamma ray emission by Sievert (1953) do not suggestradium contents of this order. In fact a cross-check in 1953 between Sieverfsapparatus and one in Leeds indicated that measured activities of persons notoccupationally exposed to radium salts were about the same in Stockholm
and Leeds. These measurements, however, do not exclude small skeletal-radium burdens of the order of 5 x 10-9 g.*A mean radium-burden of 10-10 g. has been taken as typical for a regionnot specially radioactive, and a mean burden of 10-0 g. of radium for an active region like St. Ives. Using methods similar to those given by the author elsewhere (Spiers, 1953) the mean dose-rates to osteocytes have been estimated as in Table 6J.TABLE 6JEstimation of the mean dose-rates to osteocytesConditions	Ra in skeleton (g.)

It has been assumed that hospitals outside the Health Service undertake 3 per cent ofthis number of examinations, i.e., 350,000, and that private medical practiceaccounts for a further 100,000 examinations. It is further assumed that thedistribution between types of examination and sex and age of the patientsexamined is sufficiently similar to justify the final total of 12,650,000 be ingtreated as a single group.The Genetically Significant Radiation received fromDiagnostic RadiologyThe total number of X-ray examinations performed per annumInformation under this head relating to the National Health Service has beenobtained from the Annual Reports of the Ministry of Health. other information was supplied by the Services, other government departments,and various bodies which undertake diagnostic examinations.Hospitals operating under the National Health Service are responsible forby far the biggest proportion of the X-ray diagnostic work carried out in thiscountry. Total figures for the number of X-ray examinations performed at these centres are available for the years 1951 and 1952 ; for the years 1953and 1954 however the only information given is the number of &apos; units ofwork done&apos;. Between 1951 and 1952 the number of examinations carried out under the National Health Service (Table IK) increased by 13-2 per cent,and between 1953 and 1954 by 10-9 per cent. It has, therefore, been assumed that the mean of these figures, 12 per cent, would fairly representthe increases for 1952-53 and 1954-55. The number of examinations carriedout in 1954 was estimated by applying to the number of &apos; units of work done &apos;the ratio derived from the previous year&apos;s figures, i.e., that 1 examinationequals T8566 &apos;units of work done&apos;. The figure for examinations performedin 1955, estimated on the assumption that the trend shown in the previous years continues, is, therefore, approximately 12,200,000.TABLE IKThe number of X-ray examinations per year carried out at national health Service hospitals: 1951-55
The gonad dose per examinationThe values used in the calculations for radiation dose to the reproductiveorgans are listed in Table 2K. They are based almost entirely on the work ofStanford and Vance (1955). These workers made careful measurements on more than 1,500 patients, largely at one hospital. For males, the measuringinstrument was placed close to the testes ; for females, at a point on the skinover the ovaries. A subsidiary experiment on six cadavers gave the ratio of ovary-dose to surface-dose to be expected for the different kinds of X-rayexamination ; it did not, however, give any indication of the dose receivedby the reproductive organs of a foetus. Accordingly, where the site of examination is remote from the pelvis of a pregnant woman, the dose to thefoetal gonads is taken to be the same as that to the mother&apos;s ovaries ; wherethe child is in the direct beam, however, the dose has been estimated fromthe information given by Stanford and Vance. For salpingography andpelvimetry, the doses used are the lowest that have been published in thiscountry. In the case of pelvimetry, it is assumed that three films are taken ineach examination, although many hospitals take more. The dose forsalpingography is as reported by Barnett and Bewley (1955) and that for thefoetal gonads in pelvimetry by Stanford (1951).It must be emphasised that the doses quoted in Table 2K are thoseproduced by the techniques and methods of only one hospital; further, thishospital is one where particular care is taken to reduce the gonad doses tothe minimum.TABLE 2KThe dose of radiation received by the gonads in the course of X-raydiagnostic examination of various parts of the bodyX-ray examination	Dose (mr) received by the gonads			Male	Female	FoetalHead..................	0-8	0-2	0-2Teeth         ...     ............	4-75	0-8	0-8Shoulder     ......      ...      ......	0-22	0 03	0-03Arm, hand......      ...      ......	0-26	005	0-05Rib, sternum        ...      .........	0-48	016	0-16Chest large film............	0-36	007	0-07,,   mass miniature radiography	0-25	0-15	0-15,,    special*      ...      ...      ......	37	5-4	5-4Barium swallow and meal         ......	20	9	9,,     enema	40	20	20Abdomen	69	200	580Cholecystogram	1-8	15-6	15-6Pyelogram...............	486	1,290	3,210Bladder	279	690	2,610Pelvis	1,100	210	800Hip, femur ...	710	210	800Leg, foot     .............,.	3-5	0-6	0-6Spine cervical      ...      .........	1-74	0-18	0-18,,   thoracic     ...      .........	22	15	15,,  lumbar      ...      ...      ...	129	713	713Lumbosacral joint ...      ...      ...      ...	22	220	1,540Sacro-iliac joint     ...      ...      ...      ...	129	713	2,700Salpingogram        ............	 	1,700	; Pelvimetry   ......      .........	 	1,280	2,680* An average value for bronchography, tomography, etc.

Classification of examinations by sex and age of patient and by type ofexaminationInformation as detailed as this is not readily available in many hospitals.It has, however, been obtained for 2 London teaching hospitals, 2 generalnon-teaching hospitals in the Greater London area, and a children&apos;s hospital.In the few cases where appreciable discrepancies exist, weighting was infavour of the non-teaching hospitals. Information on the number of pelvimetryand obstetric abdomen examinations carried out was obtained from 9hospitals, 5 of them outside London. Apart from these two types of examina-tion, the number of unborn children exposed to radiation was calculated fromthe number of women of childbearing age examined.Detailed resultsThe results of the calculations on the genetically significant radiationreceived from diagnostic radiology are given in Table 3K. The number ofexaminations has in each case been expressed as a percentage of 17,650,000,the estimated total number of X-ray examinations of all kinds performed inEngland and Wales in 1955. The doses received, weighted according to theage of the patients exposed, are expressed as percentages of the totalgenetically significant dose from diagnostic radiology in England and wales in 1955.For comparison, the genetically significant radiation dose from naturalradiation has been similarly calculated. Dose rates of 0T0 rad. per year formales, and 0-09 rad. per year for females have been assumed, and weightedaccording to the ages of the population as a whole. The total radiation receivedfrom diagnostic radiology is found to be 22 per cent of that received fromnatural radiation by the whole population, and is in addition to it.Strictly, these figures apply only to England and Wales, but there is noreason to think that the corresponding figures for Scotland and NorthernIreland will be greatly different. Each approximation in the calculation has,however, been estimated on the low side. According to the calculations basedon the present sample, therefore, the value of 25 per cent should be regardedas a probable lower limit, rather than as an estimate. A realistic estimateof the radiation contribution from diagnostic radiology might be considerably greater than this figure.A more detailed presentation of the subject than is possible here has beenprepared and is to be published shortly (Osborn and Smith, 1956).ReferencesBarnett, E. and Bewley, D.

The Contribution of Occupational Exposure to the Genetically SignificantDose of RadiationIn order to calculate the amount of radiation contributed to the total gonad-dose by occupational exposure, it is necessary to know (a) the number ofpersons, distributed by sex and age, who are exposed to radiation in thecourse of their work, and (b) the average gonad-dose received per personexposed. Accurate information on these points is lacking at the present time,and the following estimate is based on the best available data.An estimate of the average gonad-dose per worker can be made byanalysing the data obtained by the radiation monitoring service operated atone time by the National Physical Laboratory and now by the RadiologicalProtection Service; this service measures the occupational exposure toradiation for workers in the fields of medicine, research and industry,excluding the Atomic Energy Authority. It is a voluntary service and itscoverage is incomplete, since many organisations, particularly hospitals, carryout their own monitoring, and there are undoubtedly others where nomonitoring is done. However, the average dose recorded by the N.P.L.Service is a low one, and all the available evidence suggests that the dosesrecorded by the self-monitoring organisations are of a similar order. In thesecircumstances it has been assumed that the data obtained by the N.P.L.Service are applicable to all workers, except dentists in private practice ;analysis of these data gives the figure of approximately 50 mr. per week,or about 2-5 r per year, as the average gonad-dose for both males and femalesin all occupations.Practically no information is available about private dentists and theirassistants, but it is clear that, taking into account the number and type of examination involved, their exposure risk is very much less than that ofradiologists and radiographers ; given reasonable care, the average gonad-dose they receive will be considerably lower than the figure of 2-5 r annuallyjust quoted.Besides those persons actually working with irradiating equipment, thereare large groups of people, for example nurses in hospitals, who are exposed to some extent as a result of their work-places being near a source of radiation. These people are not regarded as being radiation workers andare not monitored ; their total number however, greatly exceeds that of theradiation workers, and although the average doses are very low, the aggregatedose is undoubtedly significant.From the Annual Reports of the Ministry of Health, it would appear thatthere are at present about 9,000 persons, excluding private dentists, occupa-tionally exposed in the medical field ; and it is estimated from information supplied by the Factory Department of the Ministry of Labour and NationalService that there are about 5,000 persons occupationally exposed in the field of industry and research. This total of 14,000 persons is divided roughlyequally between the sexes, and these are the people to whom the figure of2-5 r per year is considered to apply. Thus, the gonad-dose received per yearby this group as a result of occupational exposure, is 17,500 r to each sex.In order to allow for the group of workers exposed at a low level mentioned
ReferenceFarmer, F. R. (1956). Personal communication.E. E. Smith.above, it is considered advisable to increase this aggregate dose by about50 per cent, i.e. to 25,000 r per year, for each sex ; and a further 1,000 rshould be added to each sex to cover the doses likely to be received by thoseprivate dentists who possess X-ray equipment, and by their assistants. Thefinal total, which, it will be appreciated, is a very rough estimate, wouldthen be 26,000 r each for males and females.There is, unfortunately, no precise information about the age-distributionof these groups, and the best assumption that can be made at the present time is that the females are all below the mean age of reproduction (for women,about 28 years) and that the males are evenly distributed between the ages of 18 and 60 (mean age of reproduction about 32 years).The total number of females below the age of 28 in the United kingdom is 10 x 106. Each of these women receives a gonad dose from naturalradiation of about Od r per year, so that the total dose-contribution fromnatural radiation to this part of the female population is 106 r per year.Hence, at the present time, the occupational dose adds about 2-6 per cent tothe genetically signficant dose of natural radiation received by the femalepopulation.For males in the United Kingdom, the population is about 5 x 106 betweenthe ages of 18 and 32, and about 9 x 106 between the ages of 32 and 60.Only the dose-contribution for workers aged up to 32 is effective, so that the occupational exposure of genetic importance for male workers is about ,000 r per year. The total number of males in the United Kingdom belowthe age of 32 is about 12 x 106, so that this section of the population receivesa &quot;total dose from natural radiation of 1-2 x 106 r per year. Thus, the occupational dose constitutes an addition of about 075 per cent.Accordingly, in the United Kingdom the occupational contribution to thegenetic dose from all sources except the Atomic Energy Authority is 26,000 rper year for females and 9,000 r per year for males, i.e. 35,000 r per year inall. The dose of natural radiation received by females up to the age of 28is about 106 r per year, and by males up to the age of 32, about 1-2 x 106 rper year, making a total of 2-2 x 106 r per year. Hence, on the basis of the assumptions made, the occupational dose adds about 1-6 per cent to thegenetic dose received by the population from natural radiation. It is to benoted that the contribution from the Atomic Energy Authority, reported byFarmer (1955) is 0-09 per cent.I should like to thank Dr. G. H. Aston of the National Physical Laboratoryand Mr. K. L. Goodall of the Factory Department, Ministry of Labour and national Service, who supplied some of the information on which the aboveestimates are based.
The Long-Raiige Fail-Out from Nuclear Test ExplosionsThis appendix summarises the data available on the radiation dose to human beings resulting from the fall-out from distant nuclear explosions. Continuousmeasurements have been made since 1951 by the Atomic Energy research establishment, Harwell, of the deposition on the ground of fission products from distant nuclear explosions. Measurements have also been made of the activity in the air at ground level in the United Kingdom, and on several occasions the variation of activity with height has been explored in the atmosphere up to 50,000 ft. (Stewart, Crooks and Fisher, 1955).Diffusion and deposition of dust clouds from nuclear explosionsThe dust cloud from a weapon in the &apos; nominal&apos; size-range generallyremains within the troposphere, reaching a maximum height of some25-40,000 ft. when exploded in the middle latitudes. This part of the atmosphere is comparatively turbulent, and as the cloud travels dov/nwindit diffuses both laterally and vertically and contaminates the lower atmosphereacross a broad front at great distances. The dust is ultimately removed fromthe atmosphere by washout in rain-water and by direct deposition on tosurfaces. Measurements made in the United Kingdom have shown that theformer is the more important process and that the latter can be neglectedin comparison ; this conclusion however is not necessarily true close to the test site, where gravitational deposition may be an important factor. TheUnited Kingdom measurements have also shown that, on the average, one half of the fine dust from the smaller type of nuclear explosion is removed from the atmosphere by rain-water in a period of 22 days. Deposition ofthe dust cloud from such explosions is therefore effectively complete within months of the time of burst.The behaviour of the clouds from explosions in the megaton class ismarkedly different. These clouds penetrate into the stratosphere, and mayreach heights of the order of 100,000 ft. Diffusion is a very slow process inthe stratosphere, and material returns to the lowest layers of the atmosphereat a much slower rate than in the case of the smaller type of explosion ;a significant fraction of the dust generated may remain in the stratospherefor years after the weapon is exploded. Systematic surveys of the radioactivecontent of the air at various altitudes, taken in conjunction with fall-outmeasurements made at the same time, have shown that the dust from thesetests was being deposited at a rate of between 10 and 20 per cent per year.Measurement of airborne dust at ground levelThe concentration of radioactive dust in the atmosphere has beenmeasured routinely by drawing measured volumes of air through filters andcounting the resultant beta-activity on a suitable geiger-counter. Ground-level measurements made at Harwell since 1951 have shown that the activitypresent in air is of less biological significance than that deposited on theground. The average level of activity from nuclear explosions has beenfound to be less than 1 per cent of that due to natural radioactivity in theair, and the maximum level has never exceeded that due to natural radio-activity. The measurements also show that over the past 7 years an individualin the United Kingdom might, on the average, have inhaled a total of 3-4 x 104dpm of fission products, including 8-7 x 103 dpm of fresh fission-products
(measured at an age of 10 days) and including the particles of relatively high individual activity (Heard, 1956). The remaining 2-5 x 104 dpm con-sisted of particles of low activity, owing to their low specific-activity orprolonged radioactive decay whilst airborne. For comparison, the continuousoccupational permissible breathing-level for strontium dust is l-3xl0c dpmper day over a (working life. Table 1M summarises information on the particleswhich might have been inhaled, deduced from the detailed &apos; particle-size and activity&apos; analysis. Only particles in the high and medium specific-activitygroups are considered ; particles in the lower specific-activity groups are of less individual importance.TABLE 1 MEstimate of the probable number of radioactive particles in the high and medium specific-activity groups, inhaled by any given individual in theUnited Kingdom over the past seven years	High specific-activity		Medium specific-activity	Particle size (u)	Probable number inhaled	Total activity per particle* (dpm)	Probable number inhaled	Total activity per particle* (dpm)1-2      ...... 2-3      ...... 3-6      ...... 6-9      ...... 9-12    ......	7 1 0-5 0-07 0 01	5-4 x 10 2-5 x 102 1-4 X 103 6-6 X 103 1-8 X 104	112 14 3  -	14 66 180* Immediate half-life = 6 days.The particles carry fission-product beta-activity which decays approxi-mately inversely with time, and the activities quoted in Table 1M are those at 10 days after burst. The only significant alpha activity in the particles isthat of plutonium. The activity of a 10 u-particle may vary from about 4disintegrations per day to extremely low levels. The mean concentration ofthis alpha-activity in the ground-level air over the period has been 2 x 10-17u c per cc compared with the occupational maximum permissible limit of2x\Q-12 pc per cc (International Commission on Radiological Protection)for breathing insoluble plutonium dust over an occupational lifetime.Measurements of depositionMeasurements of the deposition of the activity have been carried out atMilford Haven and at Chilton, near Harwell, since 1951, and in NewZealand since February 1955. In the current system, rain-water falling on a12 x 10 ft. polythene roof is passed through a cylindrical esparto-grass filterand is collected in a tank. The beta activity of the dried filter is measured by mounting it co-axially over a calibrated cylindrical geiger-counter. Samplesof the filtered rain-water are evaporated and counted on the same countingsystem, so that a correction can be made for the solubility of the radioactivematerial.&apos; This measurement is made only periodically, since experience hasshown that the solubility of material from any particular bomb-series doesnot vary significantly with age, and it is possible to use a mean figure.The daily deposition records at Chilton and Milford Haven are generallysimilar, although they occasionally differ markedly in detail. All daily deposits
of surface activity greater than 5 mc per sq. mile observed between February,1951, and December, 1955, have been arranged in groups, and the frequenciesof occurrence of the various groups are given in Table 2M.TABLE 2 MThe range of values of all daily deposits of surface activity greater than 5 mcper sq. mile, observed at Chilton and Milford Haven between February,1951 and December, 1955Range of values of deposited activity (mc per sq. mile)	Frequency of occurrence		Chilton	Milford Haven5-25   .........	83	7626-50   .........	9	551-100   .........	3	1101-150   .........	3	 151-200   .........	1	 201-250   ...      ...      ...	 	1The highest daily deposit at the sites was 190 mc per sq. mile at Chiltonand 240 mc per sq. mile at Milford Haven ; these occurred about the sametime in heavy rain, some 5 days after the explosion of a weapon in Nevadain the autumn of 1951. The highest deposition in a single day from a thermo-nuclear weapon test was 25 mc per sq. mile at Chilton and 100 mc per sq.mile at Milford Haven.The Dose from deposited radioactivityThe gamma ray dose to human beings from each individual deposition offission products has been calculated. Little difficulty has been experienced in dealing with the fission products from individual test series in which.allthe explosions take place within a period of a few weeks, or in interpretingthe data when a series of nominal-bomb tests takes place in an atmospherepreviously contaminated from thermonuclear tests; the difference in thetime-scales of the deposition processes and in the decay-rates of the samplescan be used to separate the components. The major difficulty arises whenthe stratosphere is contaminated with the fission products from thermonucleartests widely separated in time. If, as we believe, the fine dust in the strato--sphere is deposited at a rate of only 10-20 per cent per year, then it can be shown that more than 90 per cent of the integrated dose per generation isdue to the single isotope, caesium 137.The gamma ray dose from each individual deposition of fission productshas been calculated, initially for the idealised case of an individual standingon an infinite flat plane. A protection factor of 3 has then been introduced to take account of the material which is washed into drains or is otherwiseremoved from the topmost layer of the earth&apos;s surface ; this factor is believed to be conservative, since about one-half of the material already depositedhas been found to be soluble in water. An additional factor of 7 has been allowed for the shielding provided by lbuildings* against the gamma rays fromfission products ; this figure has been derived from measurements carried out* It is perhaps noteworthy that the reduction in dose from this cause is much less than theenhanced dose received from the gamma radiation from the natural radioactivity of thebuilding materials (see Appendix J, p.    ).
at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment with the gamma rays fromcobalt 60, and is based on the assumption that the average individual spends2\ hours daily out-of-doors.The individual doses have been summed, and the total external dose to bereceived by the average inhabitant of the United Kingdom due to materialdeposited on the ground from bombs exploded before 31st December, 1955,is estimated to be 1-7 mr. About 75 per cent of this dose is associated withmaterial which has yet to be deposited ; the dose due to bomb dust suspendedin the air near ground level is negligible by comparison. It has also been estimated that if weapons continue to be fired at the present rate for an indefinite period, the ultimate dose per individual per generation of 30 years,will be 26 mr ; this level will be reached in approximately 100 years.Very sensitive methods of measuring the radioactivity of the human bodyhave been developed in recent years, and there has been some indication, onthe records obtained in recent months, of the presence of a 0-6 MeV gammaray, which is suspected to be due to the fission-product caesium 137 arisingfrom the fall-out; it is not yet possible, however, to identify this radiationrigorously. The radiation has been observed qualitatively on body-monitoringrecords obtained at Harwell, and has been reported in some detail in progressreports from the Argonne National Laboratory in the United States. Thehighest body-activity detected so far in the United States is found to be4 x 10O-3 uc. This activity would, if maintained, produce a total-bodyirradiation of 0-6 millirad per year, or about 1/30 of the dose due to thenaturally-occurring isotope potassium 40 in the body. The caesium activity inthe body may be expected to fluctuate in step with the rate of fall-out, ifthe biological half-life is about 20 days as suggested by the international commission on Radiological Protection, and if this activity in human bonesarises from the direct contamination of herbage; in this respect the caesiumdiffers markedly from the strontium 90, which is cumulative. From the quantities expected in the fall-out and from the chemical and metabolicproperties of this isotope, the caesium 137 in the human body due to uptakefrom food and water is unlikely, on the basis of present information,materially to affect the dose, calculated above, from the fission productsdeposited on the ground.The accumulation in the human body of strontium 90 from fall-outThe rate of deposition on the ground of strontium 90 in the fall-out hasbeen measured by radiochemical analysis and, since the spring of 1954, hasbeen found to be approximately 6 mc per sq. mile, per year. The total at31st December, 1955, was 11 mc per sq. mile. From the measurements of activity in the upper air, it is anticipated that the total from bombs alreadyfired will rise in about 10 years to a maximum of approximately 45 mc persq. mile. Should the explosions continue&apos; at the present rate, the accumulateddeposition is likely to rise to an equilibrium value of about 500 mc per sq.mile in about 100 years&apos; time.Because of its similarity to calcium, strontium is found to follow this element in the human food-chain. Measurements have, accordingly been madeof the strontium 90 activity per g. of calcium in samples of vegetation andsoil from a number of locations in the United Kingdom (Bryant and Cham-berlain, 1956). Using refined radiochemical techniques and anti-coincidencecounting procedures, the activity per g. of calcium has also been measuredin the bones of yearling sheep, in samples of milk, and in human bones. Therepresentative figure for the strontium 90 activity of vegetation in the autumn of 1955 was about 35 uuc per g. of calcium. The corresponding representative
250W. G. MARLEYfigure for sheep bones was 14 uuc per g. of calcium but in a few mountainpasture areas, values up to ten times higher have been recorded.The maximum activity found so far in the limited number of human bone-samples in the United Kingdom is T2 uuc per g. of calcium in the skeletonsof one-year-old children. Adult bones show lower activities, ranging from-05 to 0-2 uuc per g. of calcium. These levels may be compared with themaximum permissible level for strontium 90 in the body for occupationalworkers, recommended by the International Commission on RadiologicalProtection, which corresponds to about 1,000 uuc per g. of calcium. Theaverage radiation dose to the bone from a level of 1 uuc per g. of calciumwould be about 3 millirem per year, and may be compared with the doseto the bone from the background level of radium in the average person inthis country (10-10 curies), which is about 37 millirem per year, and fromnatural gamma radiation, which contributes about a further 80 millirem tothe bone (see Appendix N).ReferencesBryant, F.

An attempt to Estimate the Hazard from the Ingestion of Strontium 90During the last fifty years information has been accumulating about theinduction of cancer in man and various species of animals by ionising radiationand radioactive substances. Much of the evidence is qualitative and we have still very little reliable quantitative information on which to assess hazards.The main risk from the absorption of bone-seeking isotopes is the delayedproduction of changes in bone, sometimes followed by osteogenic sarcoma,as well as blood changes consequent upon effects in the bone marrow.The best human evidence is from the clinical investigation of patientsto whom radium salts were administered for therapeutic purposes sometwenty-five to thirty years ago, supplemented by earlier studies on industrial workers including those who ingested radioactive luminous paint: Oneof the most characteristic features of the ^production of malignant tumoursof all kinds by ionising radiations and radioactive materials is the very longlatent period, often in the region of twenty years.From a consideration of all the available evidence, the maximum permissible level of radium permanently incorporated into the skeletonhas been fixed by the International Commission on Radiological protection for persons occupationally exposed as 0:1 microcurie. From a comparison of the toxic effects of Strontium 90 as compared to radium in animalexperiments, the corresponding maximum permissible level for Strontium 90has been fixed at 10 microcurie. It must be appreciated that the biologicaleffects of the radium and its breakdown products are probably largely dueto alpha particles, whereas Strontium 90 with its associated Yttrium 90emits only beta radiation. These differences in the energies and nature ofthe radiations, as well as differences in the patterns of distribution of theradioactive materials in the bone itself, probably cause the differences inbiological effects. Strontium behaves chemically very similarly to calciumin bone formation and it is therefore natural to associate the two elements.The maximum permissible level of Strontium 90 in the human skeletoncorresponds to 1,000 micro-microcuries of Strontium 90 per gramme ofcalcium in the skeleton, and it is this concentration which determines thedose level.However, this maximum permissible level has been fixed for a group of adults educated in relation to the risks and under medical supervision and working under carefully controlled conditions.It is well-known that growing bone takes up more of the bone-seekingisotopes such as Strontium 90, and concentrates them in the rapidly growingportions of the bone. It is also well-known that rapidly growing tissues suchas those of children are often particularly radiosensitive. We must alsoconclude from the available evidence that the damage produced by radio-active materials in bone is an integrated effect over the whole time and doseof the radiation. Since the radioactive half-life of Strontium 90 is long(28 years), any material incorporated during childhood has a longer timeto act than material taken up in later life. The danger is a little mitigatedby the fact that radioactive strontium may not be retained in bone for as
long as radium. The biologically effective half-life of iStroritium 90 togetherwith its daughter product Yttrium 90 has been estimated by the international commission on Radiological Protection, as 2,700 days.Another factor which suggests caution is that it is well-known that theirradiation of tissues in inflammatory conditions is more likely to inducetumour formation than the irradiation of normal tissues, and in the whole population such conditions are more likely to occur than in the speciallyselected occupational group.It is difficult to fix precisely the lowest level at which tumour formationand other effects have occurred owing to the fact that in many instances thematerial ingested by the worker or patient has been an unknown mixture ofmesothorium and radium, and this uncertainty complicates the estimationof dose since their rates of decay are very different (mesothorium 6 1 yearshalf-life and radium 1600 years).Examination of the results of ingestion of radium by humans makes itclear that in the fixing of the maximum permissible level there is no greatsafety factor involved. A suggestive destructive lesion (in the dentine of theteeth) has been observed in a patient who carried a body burden of approxi-mately 0T5 microcurie of &quot;radium&quot; (probably a mixture of radium andmesothorium). Of 44 patients investigated by Looney et al., 36 had bodyburdens of 04 microcurie or greater; clinically recognisable, but notmalignant, hone lesions were observed in 32 of these. The lowest level ofpure radium producing a bone sarcoma in this series was 36 microcurie.Sarcomata were seen in five other patients included in this study, but thesepatients may well have ingested a mixture of radium and mesothorium.Among these five, the lowest level associated with the production of atumour was 0-52 microcurie of &quot; radium &quot; (mixture).If we assume, in accordance with the agreed international recommenda-tions, that 1 microcurie of Strontium 90 carries the same risk as 01 micro-curie of radium, then with all these considerations in mind, it would be unwise to fix the maximum allowable concentration of radioactive strontiumin the bones of the general population, with its proportion of young children, at more than one tenth of the level agreed for occupationallyexposed persons. That is, the maximum allowable concentration should notbe more than 100 microcurie of Strontium 90 per gramme of calcium.-As we consider the possible effects which might be produced at lowerdosage levels (that is, below one tenth of the maximum permissible level)our ignorance increases still further and we can only rely upon extrapola-tion from limited animal experience. It is still not possible to give acertain quantitative answer to the question of the relationship between doseand the frequency of bone changes, induction of tumours, and other effects of the radiation. At very low dose levels the incidence is so small in animalsthat the existence of a &quot; threshold&quot; below which no effect occurs hasbeen postulated.It appears however that each unit quantity of radiostrontium absorbed by the bone confers a certain probability of bone tumour formation, thetumour development time perhaps decreasing and the tumour incidenceincreasing with the dose. On the whole the experiments seem in favourof a proportionality between the frequency of tumours produced in a givenlength of time and the amount of radioactive material in the body even at low dose levels.If we assume again, in accordance with the agreed international recom-mendations, that 1 microcurie of Strontium 90 carries the same risk as
0-1 microcurie of radium, and attempt in this way to estimate the effectsat one-hundredth of the maximum permissible level, we provisionally con-clude that the effects are unlikely to be detectable. Nevertheless, if the concentration in human bones showed signs of rising greatly beyond one-hundredth of that corresponding to the maximum permissible occupationallevel it would indicate the need for immediate detailed consideration ofthe problem.ReferencesBrues, A.
