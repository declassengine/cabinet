secret.P. (56) 14413th June, 1956.CABINETTHE  100 MILLIONS SAVINGMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer it is very desirable that I should make an announcement thismonth on our progress towards achieving this saving and I would proposeto make it on Tuesday, 26th June.    We shall not be able to cover the full 100 millions, but it is essential that the total figure then to be announcedshall be as large a proportion of the  100 millions as possible.    It wouldbe stated as being &quot;on account&quot; with the rest following later.    My proposalswhich I have discussed with some of our colleagues, are as follows:2.   DefenceService Ministers have so far agreed to savings amounting to 34 millions in all.     The Treasury is to discuss with the Ministry ofDefence and the Service Departments suggestions for increasing this total,and I am hopeful that the figure will be increased.    These savings areindependent of various matters of defence policy which have still to beconsidered.3.   Home defence departments had already agreed to various savings amountingto  5 millions.    This covers fire-fighting and other Home Departmentequipment ( 1 million), additional stocks of food ( 2 millions), equipment for oil storage and distribution ( 1 million) and various other items( 1 million).Further examination suggests that we could save another 11^ millions by postponing or cancelling, wherever possible, ordersfor mobilisation stocks of equipment ( 1-g- millions), postponing turnoverpurchases of food to save a further  6 millions on food stocks andrealising Board of Trade strategic stocks without replacement (therebyreducing the present  4 millions net estimate to a token figure).The total saving on home defence would thus be  l6i millions.4.   Social services education.     The Social Services Committee have agreed that itwould be possible to increase the price of school meals from 9d. to Is.This, together with the postponement of certain capital expenditure on school kitchens, etc., would produce a saving in the current year of 4. 5 millions for England and Wales, and  0. 6 million for Scotland, inrespect of school meals.    Including minor savings on other educationalCOPY NO, JT3

Lord Chancellor;   By raisingCounty Court Fees  (this has already been done):Other miscellaneous items:180,0001,000, 000 10,000,0006.   Further proposals on Civil Expenditure(a) Colonial Office expenditure.    This expenditure amounts inall to more than  40 millions.    So far the Colonial Secretary has onlyfelt able to offer a saving of  500, 000 (not included above) on theDevelopment and Welfare Vote, on condition that he could say, ifnecessary, that there is no intention to &quot;go slow&quot; on Colonial develop-ment;  and savings of  750,000 on grants to Kenya and Hong Kong, on condition that these sums can be paid over early in 1957/58.    I do notthink we could put forward the latter as a real saving counting againstthe  100 millions.    On the former, I do not see why, in presentcircumstances, we should not reduce further the rate at which we arenow providing for Colonial development, and I think we could properlyask for a saving on this year*s provision of   1 million without anyguarantee as to when it will be made good.(b) Overseas Information Expenditure.     I have asked theForeign Secretary to look again at the overseas expenditure of the B,B,C,and the British Council.    At the Prime Minister&apos;s meeting on Anglo-Soviet relations on 1st May the Foreign Secretary was asked to make recommendations to the Cabinet about our anti-Communist propaganda,including the overseas service of the B.B.C,    It seems to me that weshould make a substantial reduction in the B.B,C,&apos;s European Services,I propose that we should decide now to make a reduction of at least 1 million in those Services and include that sum in the details of myannouncement about the  100 million savings.7. The Bread and Milk SubsidiesThe announcement made in my statement of 17th February andin my Budget Speech - to abolish the bread subsidy and to increase theprice of milk by fd. on 1st July - were made after the Estimates for1956-57 were presented and we can take credit for them against the 100 million.    But, if we do that, we must allow for off-setting increased expenditure resulting, first, from the annual farm price review;secondly, from the effect of the increase in the milk price on the cost of welfare milk and school milk;  and, thirdly, for the concessions on family allowances.    On this basis, the net sum to be credited against the 100 million is  11 millions.8. Further reduction in the Milk SubsidyI think it is generally agreed in principle that it is desirableto reduce the subsidy further by increasing the price of milk by anotherfd., beyond the increase due from 1st July. If the second jd. were imposed as from 1st October, 1956, the net further saving, in 1956-57,after allowing for the increased cost to the Exchequer of welfare milk and school milk, would-be-  0 millions. If the price of welfare milk(but not school milk) were increased by the extra  d. - which I believe
i o ywould be fully justified - the net saving would be increased from 8 millions to  9jr millions.A question has been raised whether it would be wise to announce the second ^-d. on 26th June, i. e, before the first ^d. has taken effect and before, therefore, we have any experience of the July increase on consumption.    If an announcement of the second id. increase is to be delayed it would seem necessary to postpone it until Parliament re-assembles after the summer recess, in which case we should lose about half this year&apos;s savings.    I should naturally prefer to announce the increasenow, with effect from 1st October.Pending a decision on this question of timing I have not takenany credit for savings from the second ^-d. in the figures in the nextparagraph.9. SummaryIf all the proposals made above are agreed (except that for afurther reduction of the milk subsidy, discussed in paragraph 8), weshould be able to show, in my announcement on 26th June, a total in roundfigures of  79 millions on account of the  100 millions.    The total wouldbe made up as follows:Already further agreed Proposals Totalmade above m.  m.  m.Defence .34                          - 34Home Defence 5 11-i- 16-^Social Services S\                         - 5\Other Civil 10&apos; 2 12*Bread and milksubsidies (net) 11                           - 1165^ 13A 7910. I invite the Cabinet to agree that I should make a statement on 26th June on this basis.11. In conclusion I would only say that, while the total we canannounce on 26th June is not unsatisfactory, we have some way to go yet.The last  20 millions may well be very difficult to find.    I hope that some-thing on account of Defence policies yet to be decided may help to bridge the gap;  but it is very probable that I shall have to ask my colleagues for yet further contributions on the Civil side.H.M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.12th June, 1956.
