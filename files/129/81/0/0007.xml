SECRET Copy No. 5 2CP. (56) 1071st May, 1956CABINETCEYLONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the defeat of the Ceylon Government came as a great surprise. The UnitedNational Party had been in power ever since Independence (and most of its members were in office before then); the timing of the election was entirely atthe Governments choice and they deliberately and cynically decided in favourof Sinhalese as the official language since they thought an election on this issue would make victory certain. The defeat is all the more remarkable consideringthe prestige which inevitably attaches to the Government in power, in an orientalcountry, and the variety of methods open to the Party in control to win support.2. The new Party committed itself during its election campaign to theintroduction of a number of policies which could bring it into conflict with us. My colleagues may therefore wish to have some general appreciation of theposition. The High Commissioner has forwarded a despatch (No. 14 of 16th April)summarising the election and its results: this is being circulated. The essentialpoints are:  (i) Mr. Bandaranaike&apos;s coalition consists of his own party (the Sri LankaFreedom Party) and a dissident Trotskyist Party: this coalition emergedvictorious with a working majority (51 out of 95 seats); they wereaided by electoral understandings with the Communist Parties.(ii) The Kotelawala regime took a severe knock (52 seats in the previousParliament, 8 in the present one). On the other hand, their loss of seats is not commensurate with their loss of votes: they polled nearly three-quarters of a million as opposed to just over a million for theBandaranaike combination, a quarter of a million for the official(Opposition) Trotskyist Party which secured 14 seats and just over a quarter of a million for Independents.(iii) The Communists generally have strengthened their position.   TheTrotskyist splinter group is included in Mr. Bandaranaike&apos;s coalition.The official Communists have increased their number from two to three and the official Trotskyist Party from 5 to 14.3. The result is probably more a vote against the previous Government than for any new policy. In some ways this is a healthy sign. The previous regimehad become corrupt and autocratic; its leaders were wealthy landowners who werenot averse from rigging affairs to suit their own convenience. Sir John Kotelawala,their leader, was a vain, ambitious self-advertiser, determined to &quot; put Ceylon onthe map.&quot; In one sense it is salutary that the Ceylon public should have &quot; seenthrough &quot; Sir John Kotelawala and their vote can be regarded as a sign of intelligentdemocracy. But the vote may also be interpreted as an assertion of Ceylonnationalism and, in so far as it is against co-operation with the West and &quot; bigbusiness,&quot; our interests may suffer.hi &amp;Printed for the Cabinet.

4. It remains to be seen how effective Mr. Bandaranaike&apos;s Government willbe. He himself is neither hostile nor unreasonable; he was educated at oxford and has always enjoyed friendly relations with people from this country. He isnot, however, a strong character; only one other of his Ministerial colleagues has,m ever held office before; and Mr. Bandaranaike may find difficulty in welding hisC very mixed team together. Pressures within the coalition group may also developbefore long.5. There are three main spheres in which we may have difficulties with thenew Government:^(i) Constitutional.(ii) Economic.(iii) Politico-Strategic.(i) ConstitutionalThe Bandaranaike Party committed itself during the electoral campaign tothe introduction of a Republic. After the election, Mr. Bandaranaike said thatmaking Ceylon a Republic and seceding from the Commonwealth were changes which needed the amendment of the Constitution with a two-thirds majority inthe House of Representatives. He added that he was pledged to introduce are public but, though his Party had originally favoured withdrawal from theCommonwealth, the example of India and Pakistan had shown that Commonwealthstatus was not incompatible with full independence. In the Speech from the throne on 20th April the Governor-General said, &quot; Among the Constitutionalmatters to which attention will be paid in due course will be the question ofestablishing a Republic and of ensuring the more effective and efficient functioning of the principles of democracy.&quot;It seems clear, therefore, that the Ceylon Government will wish to proceedwith establishing a Republic and I am sure myself that we should not attempt inany manner to stand in their way. I should hope that Ceylon would not wish toleave the Commonwealth.There is no need for us to take the initiative and we can wait for the ceylon government. Any decision to declare a Republic while remaining a Memberof the Commonwealth would require the consent of the other Members but mr. Bandaranaike has so far given no sign of wishing to bring this forward at thetime of the forthcoming Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting.(ii) EconomicMr. Bandaranaike&apos;s Party in their election manifesto called for the nationalisation of all essential industries, foreign-owned plantations, transport,banking and insurance but Mr. Bandaranaike has since said that he is opposedto any form of expropriation and that he would proceed to schemes of State controlonly where such action was in the best interest of the country. The Speechfrom the Throne merely states that, &quot; In pursuance of its socialist policy, my government will take early steps where the best interests of the country so requireto nationalise certain essential services such as transport.&quot; This means in effect the bus companies,.in which we have no interests. It would be a very different matter if there were to be serious intention to expropriate the large British-ownedplantations (principally tea). But this would raise grave budgetary, externalexchange, and technical problems for the Ceylon Government; and the newMinisters may be expected soon to appreciate how much the economy of Ceylon is dependent on United Kingdom investment and technical and managerial expertise.It should therefore be possible to persuade them not to pursue the nationalisation ofplantations. Our banking and insurance interests may, however, be in danger in due course and our people generally in Ceylon will certainly suffer from someincreased pressure to employ more Ceylonese and their business may become moredifficult.(iii) defence the Party manifesto called outright for an immediate withdrawal of foreignbases and foreign troops. The Speech from the Throne merely stated,&quot; The positionof the bases at Katunayake (known to us as Negombo) and Trincomalee will be reviewed.   Every endeavour will be made to establish close collaboration and
co-operation with other countries.&quot; Mr. Bandaranaike has since said that he is satisfied that there were no secret clauses in the defence agreements with theUnited Kingdom (about which he had previously expressed doubts) and thathe intends to deal with these questions with the appropriate Ministers when hecomes to London.Our defence interests in Ceylon cover three fields:  (a) the naval base and facilities at Trincomalee;(b) the Negombo airfield which is maintained by the R.A.F.;(c) various important communication facilities.The Chiefs of Staff have put in hand a study of the strategic importance to theUnited Kingdom of Ceylon, and this will include an appreciation of which of our defence facilities there must be retained and which could be dispensed with. TheMinister of Defence and I will report to the Defence Committee. Briefly theposition is that (a) the naval base is very expensive to maintain and the Admiralty are considering whether we could without undue difficulty give up some ofthe facilities we at present enjoy;(b) the Negombo airfield is needed under our present and future plans for transport to the Far East as a supplement to the limited facilities weenjoy in India; we must seek to maintain a staging post in Ceylon, butit is too early yet to say whether any modification in the present arrangements would be acceptable;(c) the communication facilities are also important to us and must be preserved, but the means of doing so need further examination.6. In general Mr. Bandaranaike has shown signs of moderation and sense ofresponsibility since gaining office. He responded with alacrity to the PrimeMinister^ invitation to him to attend the Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting in June andit is clear that he is looking forward to his visit. A cordial welcome was given tothe First Sea Lord on his recent visit to Ceylon and both the Governor-Generaland the Prime Minister had friendly discussions with him. He has also expressedthe hope that the Queen Mother&apos;s visit may take place in 1957 as planned.Mr. Bandaranaike does not seem out to make difficulties for us and indeed hemay well have enough problems on his hands on the domestic front. Moreover,experience is likely to teach him increasing responsibility. The more he learnsabout the economic situation of his country, the less likely he is to wish to alienateBritish business. The more he gets into difficulties with the Indian government over the thorny problems of Indians in Ceylon, the higher value he is likely toplace on some show of force by us in the area. I think therefore that we shall be wise for the time being to see how events shape before making hasty judgments.7. On the other hand, one fact seems clear. Mr. Bandaranaike himself is anadmirer of Mr. Nehru&apos;s policy of &quot; neutralism &quot; and the Ceylon electorate haveclearly declared against even such little co-operation with the West as the previous government was prepared to contemplate. As the Speech from the Throne makesclear, &quot; In its foreign policy my Government will not align itself with any Powerblocs.&quot; This has the true Nehru ring and I fear that it is unlikely that Ceylon willin the near future be rescued from this camp. The consequences of this need notbe serious to us except in one respect that in the event of an emergency in theFar East or in South-East Asia in which we were involved and in which we did nothave the support of the Ceylon Government we might find that, whateveragreements we were able to reach, the route for reinforcements was just as effectively barred in Ceylon as in similar circumstances it would be in India. As see it, this is the real danger to us of the Ceylon election, since, at thepresent moment, no alternative routes exist and it would be difficult and will take time and money to provide them.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,28th April. 1956.
