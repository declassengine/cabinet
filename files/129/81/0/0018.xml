SECRETCP. (56) 1109th May, 1956CABINETWAGES AND prices memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer as the Cabinet know, the Prime Minister has had some talk withrepresentatives of industry, of the Trade Unions and of the nationalised industries about the problem of rising prices.     The Lord Privy Seal, theMinister of Labour and I have been present at these talks.2.     We have arranged to meet representatives of the Trades UnionCongress   (T.U.C.) again on the afternoon of 10th May.3.      There are no signs of any reduction in the pressure for increased wages.     The threat of this, followed by price increases, is almost thegreatest of our economic problems.    It has reached the point where it isthreatening confidence in the value of our money, both at home and abroad.A loss of confidence in money will disrupt the economic system.4.      It is therefore necessary for the Government to give a firm lead and to stick to it.5.     We therefore propose to show the statement, a draft of which isattached at Appendix I, to the Trade Union leaders on Thursday.6.      The Minister of Labour will show the statement to representativesof the employers, and ask them to play their part in operating the policyit outlines.    The statement will also be shown to the Ministers responsiblefor the nationalised industries.7.      The question arises as to when the statement should be issued.This, no doubt, will partly depend on the attitude of the T. U. C.0.      The passage referring to changes in prices initiated by theGovernment and by the nationalised industries takes account not only of measures already announced, but of changes not yet announced whichmay be consequent on past wage awards or the further reduction ofGovernment expenditure which I announced in my Budget statement.The details of the figure of 2f points mentioned in the statement are set out in Appendix II.9.     No allowance has been made in all this for the effect of our plans for rents.    We should, however, inform the T. U. C. that rents representthe one remaining price distortion in the economy, which the Governmentwill have to tackle in due course.H.M.if&quot;COPY NO. ^O-Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.9th May, 1956,
STATEMENT ON prices in the recent White Paper on &quot;The Economic Implications of full employment&quot; (Cmd. 9725), the Government pointed out the dangers toour economic system of the steady upward movement in costs and prices.2.      These dangers are not threats in a distant and uncertain future.They are real and immediate.    The Government has discussed them withrepresentatives of industry and the Trade Unions.3.      In the course of these discussions, attention has been drawn to increases in prices initiated or approved by the Government itself, anddesigned either to limit consumption in order to free resources for exports or to avoid losses in the nationalised industries.4.      The effect of such price increases already announced or in sprospect is estimated at an increase of a little over 2*- points in all inthe new cost-of-living index during 1956,    Some part of this has alreadybeen reflected in the March cost-of-living index figure.5,      Unless there are further wage increases in the nationalised industries, the Government sees no reason to expect any further increasein the cost of living above that level, resulting either from its own actionsor those of the nationalised industries.6.      Changes in the prices of imported materials, whether up or down,of sufficient size to affect the consumer in this country can only be broughtabout by marked changes in world economic conditions.    So far as canbe seen at present, there are no indications of overall changessufficient to force an increase in consumer prices here.7.      The Government has asked representatives of industry to makea special effort to keep their own prices steady, except where wage increasmake this impossible.8.      The Government also asks that organised labour will show theutmost moderation in its demands.9. If the Government, and both sides of industry, are prepared toact in this way then we can look forward with confidence to a period ofsteadiness in prices.10.     During this period it is the intention of the Government to continue discussions on longer-term policy.    As the White Paper pointed out, theGovernment does not believe that full employment and stable prices areobjectives which cannot be reconciled in a democratic society.
