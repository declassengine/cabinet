SECRETCP. (56) 141 COPY NO. (qQ9th June, 1956CABINETFEDERATION OF RHODESIA AND NY AS ALANDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations and the Secretary of State for the colonies the ProposalsLord Malvern, the Prime Minister of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland, who is now in London, has stated in recent letters that heand his colleagues are greatly concerned about the effect that attainment of full self-government by the Gold Coast and Malaya will have on Europeanopinion in the Federation.    Fie has urged that the Federation should not beleft with a status inferior to that of those two countries and has put forward proposals which, he thinks, would allow the Federation also to claim to be fully self-governing and independent.    He has not asked in so many wordsfor membership of the Commonwealth, but this is implicit.     Lord Malvernhas said that, unless his proposals are accepted, the 1958 elections mightwell produce a Government which would not be able to preserve stability.We have undertaken to discuss the matter with him while he is in London.2.      Lord Malvern&apos;s proposals are as follows:-(1)    that the United Kingdom Parliament should pass on act of Independence,  similar to the Ceylon IndependenceAct, 1947;(2)    that certain provisions in the Federal Constitution(Annexure to S.I. 1953, No. 1199) restricting thepowers of the Federal Government,  should beremoved by Order in Council.This would have the effect of -(a) abolishing the African Affairs Board whichwas established under the constitution to safeguard Africans against discriminatorylegislation by the Federal Parliament;   and(b) removing the United Kingdom Governmenfspower to disallow Federal legislation,except that they would retain power todisallow legislation amending theConstitution.
(3)    that at the same time the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and the Federation should conclude anagreement in which the Federal Government wouldvoluntarily undertake to consult the United KingdomGovernment before amending specified articles ofthe Constitution and before presenting for royal assent any measure which discriminated againstAfricans,Lord Malvern has not suggested that the inhabitants of the federation should be consulted but the members of the Federal Parliament represent-ing African interests could express their views.Limitations on the Powers of the Federal government.      The Federal Constitution is so constructed that the Federationfalls short of full self-government in the following ways:-(1)    There are provisions in the Constitution designed toenable the United Kingdom Government to safeguard the interests of Africans in matters which are theresponsibility of the Federal Government and toenable the United Kingdom Government to fulfill their international obligations in respect of theFederation.(These are, broadly speaking, the provisions which Lord Malvernproposes to transfer from the Constitution to an agreementbetween theUnited Kingdom and Federal Governments.)(2)    Responsibility over a wide range of matters, includinglaw and order, control of land and the local and territorial political advancement of the people,rests with the territorial Governments of SouthernRhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.    InNorthern Rhodesia and Nyasaland this responsibilityis subject to the control of the United KingdomGovernment.    In Southern Rhodesia also the UnitedKingdom Government have limited reserve powers,particularly in respect of African land.(Lord Malvern does not propose any change in the powers of theterritorial Governments, and the ultimate responsibility of the UnitedKingdom Government for the three territorial Governments would remain undiminished. )Basic considerations .      The basic questions arising from Lord Malvern&apos;s proposals are:-(1)    Could the proposals, if adopted, lead to theFederation -(a) being internationally recognised as independent ?(b) being admitted to full membership of the Commonwealth ?
(2)    Are the United Kingdom Government willing to do whatis asked without ascertaining the opinion of theinhabitants (African as well as European)?(3)    Are the United Kingdom Government prepared tointroduce into Parliament at Westminster an act of Independence for the Federation?These questions are considered in paragraphs 5-10.International recognition and admission as a full member of theCommonwealth5.      If the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government (exercisedthrough the Colonial Secretary) in Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland is toremain undiminished, it is unlikely that the Federation would be recognisedinternationally as independent and it is doubtful, even if the UnitedKingdom Government thought this desirable, whether all the other Common-wealth Prime Ministers, particularly the Asian Prime Ministers, would agree to accept the Federation as a full member of the Commonwealth.Wishes of the Inhabitants6.      Africans in Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland were in generalopposed to the introduction of Federation.    We therefore gave assurancesin Parliament that there would be no change in the status of theconstituent territories against the wishes of the inhabitants and that theFederation should go forward to full membership of the Commonwealth only when the inhabitants of the Federation so desired.     This was written intothe Preamble to the Constitution.    On 24th June, 1953, the colonial secretary - then Mr. Oliver Lyttelton - said in the House of Commons ina debate on the Federal Constitution -&quot;None of these separate States could be incorporated in a unified State whether by amalgamation or in order to getDominion Status, unless the Government of the day of theUnited Kingdom are satisfied that the majority of the peopleso desire it.....Nothing short of that will enable any government to approach a scheme of amalgamation or of a status which will end in Dominion Status without the agree-ment of the majority of the inhabitants.     I give a categoricalassurance about that. &quot;Parliamentary pledges apart, there is an essential difference between theGold Coast and Malaya on the one hand, and the Federation on the other.Wh en the Gold Coast and Malaya achieve independence, their Govern-ments will represent a majority of their populations.    In the Federa-tion, where the inhabitants number 7 million Africans and 240,000Europeans, the Government represents the European minority.    Itwould not be politically possible at the present day to hand over powerto a minority, unless it could be shown that the majority of thepopulation supported the change.7.      Even though we may consider that Lord Malvern&apos;s proposals, if adopted, would not confer complete independence on the Federation,nevertheless, in the light of our pledges and as a matter of practical politics, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be bound to ascertain theopinion of the inhabitants of the Federation and to bring the proposed changesbefore Parliament at Westminster.
0.      As things are, any formal constitutional step, whether it purported to confer independence on the Federation or merely to take the Federationfurther along the road to independence, would at the present time be opposed by the majority of Africans in the Federation and by the opposition in ??parliament.    Even if the transfer of the safeguards from theConstitution to an inter-Governmental agreement were represented asreproducing the present situation without amending it, we should be asked why this step was being taken.    The change would be criticsed as awhittling away of safeguards which the Africans consider important.The fate of the Irish Treaty and of the entrenched clauses in the SouthAfrica Act would be thrown in our teeth, and we should have stirred up ahornet&apos;s nest for the sake of changes which would not, in our opinion,achieve Lord Malvern&apos;s object.9.      There would therefore, in our opinion, be no purpose either in introducing a Federal Independence Bill into Parliament or in agreeing to other changes which would necessitate a Parliamentary debate.Alternative Proposals for giving the Federation some limitedadvancement10.    It would not, however, be politic to give a purely negative answer to Lord Malvern.    The Cabinet decided on 7th December, 1954 mat, whenthe Gold Coast became a full member of the Commonwealth, the PrimeMinister of the Federation should be invited to attend meetings of commonwealth Prime Ministers as of right (C. C. (54) 83rd Conclusions).The Cabinet also contemplated that other changes should be made to accord to the Federation, within the limits set by its Constitution, asmuch as possible of the practical substance of full commonwealth membership.11.     The Federation already enjoys some attributes of a full memberof the C omm on wealth :-(l)   The Federation has acceded in its own right to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade and is also a member,on an equal footing with other members of the Common-wealth, of most Commonwealth bodies.(2)  The Prime Minister of the Federation is invited tomeetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, thoughso far he has been invited ad hoc on each occasion.(3)   The High Commis sioner for the Federation in london is invited to meetings between the commonwealth secretary and Commonwealth High Commissionerson economic and defence matters.(4)   The United Kingdom Government have already delegated to the Federal Government the power to enter into certain agreements with other countries, includingtrade agreements.(5)   The Federation already exchanges Trade Commissionerswith other Commonwealth Governments and high commissioners with the Union of South Africa and theUnited Kingdom.    It also appoints consular representatives to neighbouring foreign countries.
12.     The Annex to this paper describes a number of ways in which theFederation could be given some improvement in its status.    The mostimportant would be attendance of the Federal Prime Minister, as of right,at Meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, and an extension of theFederal Government^ powers in the field of external affairs.    Weshould like to be authorised to explore with Lord Malvern whetherchanges on these lines would help the Federation.13.     These improvements, however, are unlikely to satisfy theFederal Government.     Something more positive is required.    It is,moreover, in the interests of the United Kingdom to lead the Federationtowards full membership of the Commonwealth, provided that this canbe done with the agreement of the majority of the inhabitants.    TheConstitution is, by Article 99, due for review between I960 and 1962.That would therefore be an occasion for making any changes that maybe found desirable.    But it should be made clear to the Federal Govern-ment that, even then, a step forward will only be possible if a majorityof the population, including the African population,  so desire.    KerMajesty&apos;s Government and the Governors of the Northern Territorieswill be ready to do everything they can to induce a change in the climateof African opinion and to co-operate with the Federal Government to that end.    Success, however, will depend very largely on the willingness ofthe Federal Government and their supporters in future to do and say far more of the things that are calculated to win African confidence and farless of the things that arouse their suspicion and resentment.14.     To sum up, the Federal Government want full self-government and full membership of the Commonwealth, but the Constitution of theFederation precludes it, unless the inhabitants (7 million Africans and240, 000 Europeans) so desire.    It is in the interest of the United kingdom to have the Federation as a full member of the Commonwealth, but weare pledged to Parliament not to give the Federation a status which will lead to that, without the agreement of the majority of the inhabitants, andany attempt to do so would be likely not only to raise a storm inParliament here but also to have severe repercussions in Africa.    the african inhabitants therefore hold the key to constitutional progress.Recommendations15.    V/e accordingly recommend that we should speak to Lord Malvernon the following lines:-(l)  United Kingdom Ministers fully sympathise with the desire of the Federation to become self-governing as soon aspossible.(2)  But the Federation is less than three years old.Lord Malvern will remember the difficult negotiations with preceded it, and he knows mat the result was a compromise.    It was part of the compact of federationthat the United Kingdom Government should retaincertain responsibilities.    Because of the pledgeswritten into the Preamble to the Constitution and givento the United Kingdom Parliament, major changes of the kind proposed by Lord Malvern could not bemade without consulting the inhabitants of the Federa-tion and bringing the matter before Parliament.     Toraise the matter formally now might provoke somuch opposition as. to do more harm than good to theFederation.
9j(3)   This does not mean that United Kingdom Ministers are not anxious to do all they can to meet Lord Malvern withinthe limits set by the Constitution and the pledges givento Parliament.    They will be glad, for example, to explore with him whether the steps envisaged inparagraphs B to E of the Annex to this paper would help the Federation.(4)   The United Kingdom Government recognise that this wouldnot mean self-government.    But neither doLord Malvern&apos;s proposals mean self-government, since they would leave the Governments of Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland subject to the ultimate over-ridingresponsibility of the United Kingdom Government.(5)  Membership of the Commonwealth is confined to countries possessing full powers of self-government.Although the Federation are not yet self-governing,the United Kingdom Government recognise their special position and propose that they should be given thepractical substance of Commonwealth membership;   inaddition to the steps proposed to be taken under (3)above, this would mean in effect representation atPrime Ministers&apos; Meetings as of right.(6)  Full powers of self-government, and commonwealth membership which may be expected to follow, can comeif the support of the Africans, particularly in northern rhodesia and Nyasaland, were to be obtained for a forward move when the Constituion is due for review in the early 1960s.     Cannot Lord Malvern get his people to work for this?    For their part, the UnitedKingdom Government and the Governments ofNorthern Rhodesia and Nyasaland will be ready toco-operate in bringing home to Africans the benefits of Federation.H.A.L. -B.9th June, 1956.
PROPOSALS TO ENHANCE THE STATUS OF THEFEDERATIONA. Attendance of the Federal Prime Minister at Meetings of commonwealth Prime ministers at present the Federal Prime Minister is invited to these Meetingsad hoc.It is proposed that, in accordance with the Cabinet decision of 7th May, 1954, agreement of other Prime Ministers should be soughtduring the forthcoming meetings in London to the attendance of theFederal Prime Minister on future occasions as of right.B. External affairs.   Agreements with other countries the United Kingdom Government have already delegated to theFederal Government authority to enter into -(i)  agreements of purely local concern with any neighbouringcountry in Africa;(ii)  trade agreements with any country relating solely to thetreatment of goods.The Federal Government might now be given freedom to conductall its relations direct with other Commonwealth countries and to enterinto agreements of any kind with them.The United Kingdom Government might also offer to consider,in consultation with the Federal Government, an extension of the federal governments existing authority to make agreements with foreign govern-ments.This authority, as regards both Commonwealth countries andforeign countries, would have to be limited by the United kingdom governments continuing international responsibilities for the federation and by the willingness of foreign governments to deal direct with theFederation.    One such limitation would be that matters relating to shipping (other than inland transport) and the rights of persons and companies should be dealt with by the Federal Government in each caseonly with the express sanction of the United Kingdom Government.2.   Exchange of representatives with other countries(a) The Federal Government already exchange Trade Commissionerswith other Commonwealth Governments and High Commissioners with theUnion of South Africa and the United Kingdom. They are also authorisedto appoint Consular representatives in neighbouring countries.
Authority could now be given to the Federal Government to exchangHigh Commissioners with any other Commonwealth Government.(b) As long as the Federation is not a sovereign State it cannotexchange diplomatic representatives with foreign countries;  foreignrepresentation in Salisbury can only be Consular.The Federal Government could be encouraged to appoint non-diplomatic representatives in foreign countries willing to receive them;we have already agreed that they should, if they wish, appoint arepresentative in the United States,(c) In addition, representatives of the Federation could be associatedwith United Kingdom diplomatic missions in more foreign countries.Arrangements for one such appointment, that of a Federation Counselloron the staff of the British Embassy in Lisbon, are nearing completion.3.   Membership of International organisations the Federation has already acceded in its own right to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, is a member of the WorldMeteorological Organisation and an associate member of the WorldHealth Organisation.If the Federal Government wish to seek membership of other international organisations, the United Kingdom Government should support their applications whenever the Federation is eligible under theconstitution of the organisation concerned.C. Information on Foreign AffairsThe Commonwealth Relations Office should in consultation withthe Foreign Office, and subject to security considerations, give theFederal Government more information on foreign affairs.D. Attendance of the High Commissioner for the Federation at meetings between the Commonwealth Secretary and  Common-wealth High CommissionersAt present the High Commissioner is invited to these meetingswhere they concern economic and defence matters.He should now be invited to attend meetings on all subjects.This would be in line with a decision to accept the attendance of theFederal Prime Minister at Meetings of Commonwealth Prime ministers as of right.E. Power to legislate with extra-territorial effect at present the Federal Legislature cannot enact measures whichhave extra-territorial effect, and the Federal Government have to rely on United Kingdom legislation (e.g. the United Kingdom Army Act gives the Federal Government authority to exercise discipline over Federaltroops outside the Federation).If the Parliamentary situation at Westminster permitted, theFederal Legislature could, through an Act of the United kingdom parliament, be given limited powers to legislate with extra-territorialeffect.    Such an Act could relate to the Federation alone or might possibly be one dealing with the delegation of power to Colonial territories as well as the Federation.
