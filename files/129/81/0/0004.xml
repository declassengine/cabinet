Si ) V :i   m v.    MS: .   ; .        .&apos;EJIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-&apos; j;____------secret.F,(56) 10424th April, 1956RENT RESTRICTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland the general considerations which make it necessary to amend the Rent Acts and increase controlled rents apply in Scotland as inEngland and Wales..     There is, indeed, a special factor in Scotland inthat the actual income the owner obtains from the house he lets has beenprogressively reduced over a period of years because the amount of owner&apos;s rates he has to pay on his house has increased without anycompensating increase in the controlled rent.2,      I think, therefore, that the Bill v/hich the Minister of Housingproposes must apply to Great Britain as the Rent Acts do.    I have, ofcourse, been a member of the Ministerial Committee and I am in generalagreement with the proposals.    How these proposals can be given effect in Scotland in view of the changes which are pending under the valuation and Rating (Scotland) Bill is a matter of extreme difficulty to which Ishall have to give further consideration.    I am satisfied, however,that it v/ould be undesirable to contemplate a separate Scottish bill and accordingly the application of a Great Britain Bill to Scotland willhave to be settled as a matter of urgency.-   3.      I am, therefore, concerned about the timing of the Bill intwo respects;(i)   the date of its introduction into the House;(ii)   the date at which the new rent increases take effect.Date of introduction4.      The Valuation and Rating (Scotland) Bill, which will abolishowner&apos;s rates as from May, 1957, is still in the Scottish GrandCommittee,     The Rating Bill is vital from my point of view for manyreasons and indeed the abolition of owner *s rates is very important forthe future of the rent controlled houses themselves.     The Bill providesfor the present rents of these houses being reduced in May, 1957, bythe current amount of rates which the owner pays.     This is an essential feature of the Bill:  I have stressed throughout that the abolition of owner&apos;s rates will not involve any increase in the burden of rents and rates borne by the tenant.COPY NO.  &amp; /CABINET
I. a)5.      From my point of view, it would be disastrous to introduce the rents Bill before the passage of the Valuation and Rating Bill is assured.It would mean that there would be two Bills under discussion, eachchanging controlled rents in Scotland in very different ways.    Once theGovernment&apos;s intentions on rents are known it would be very difficult,if not impossible, for me to get the Valuation and Rating Bill through.There is the further difficulty that as long as Scottish Ministers and members are involved in Committee on the Rating Bill they cannot be free, as they must be, to take part in the Committee stages of the rents Bill.6.      I must ask, therefore, that any announcement about the RentsBill and its introduction into the House should be deferred until thepassage of the Scottish Rating Bill is assured.The timing of the new rent increase7.      Secondly, I am concerned about the rate at v/hich the new rent increases are to take effect.    I assume that the Rents Bill cannotbecome law before November and that there must then be regulationsproviding for the form of notice of increase which the owner is to giveand some period of notice to the tenant before the increase takes effect.There may also be an argument for giving the tenant of the sub-standardhouse some reasonable time in which to seek the certificate of disrepairwhich will bar the full increase being put on his house.8,      The timing of the increase, as well as its amount, raisesdifficult questions for me.     The Scottish rents,  as I have said, are due to be reduced by the Rating Bill in May, 1957.    I shall therefore have to give further consideration to the date on which rent restrictionincreases are to operate, taking account both of the timetable of the valuation and Rating (Scotland) Bill and of the timetable proposed bythe Minister of Housing for rent restriction changes in England and Wales9.      The actual method of calculating the Scottish increased rents and the manner in which this is to be provided in the Bill depend on whether the increase is to go on before May, 1957.     I shall want todiscuss it further with rny colleagues on the Ministerial committee before the Bill is introduced.JaSeScottish Office, S.W.I.,23rd April,  1956.
