Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1956SECRET Copy No. iCP. (56) 12417th May, 1956CABINETPETITION FOR A PARLIAMENT FOR wales memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh affairs a petition was presented in the House of Commons on 24th April byMr. Goronwy Roberts, M.P., containing the signatures of nearly 250,000 people in Wales who, according to the terms of the petition (copy attached), are in favourof a separate Parliament for Wales.2. On 26th April I received a deputation from the Parliament for WalesCommittee, led by the Lady Megan Lloyd-George. The deputation claimed thatthe petition represented a cross-section of Welsh opinion, and that nearly 80 percent, of the people approached had signed it. Though the signatories amount to only one-tenth of the total population of Wales, the deputation thought that if ithad been possible to approach everybody in Wales the response throughout thewhole country would have been in the same proportion. The deputation gave no evidence to support this opinion.3. I made it clear to the deputation that the views of the Government hadbeen put on record when I spoke in March 1955 against the&quot; Second Reading ofMr. S. O. Davies&apos; Government of Wales Bill (which set out to establish a separateWelsh Parliament on the model of Northern Ireland). I could only agree with thedeputation in desiring as much administrative devolution to Wales as possible.I undertook no more than to bring the terms of the petition and the extent of its support to the notice of my colleagues, and it is for this reason only that I amsubmitting this paper.4. I would not suggest that there is any need at the present time forreconsideration of the arrangements for Welsh administration. A separateParliament is, in any case, not practical politics. Leaving aside the merits of thearguments which the Parliament for Wales Committee put forward and whichI regard as mistaken the greater part of Welsh opinion does not really expect to see a separate Parliament established, and there is an air of unreality about the petition. Labour policy goes no further than a separate Secretary of State, andConservative opinion would no doubt be distressed by anything less than a flatnegative to the petition.5. In my own view the right path of progress is to seek, for furtheradministrative devolution to the Welsh offices of Government Departments. TheCouncil for Wales and Monmouthshire are at present conducting an enquiry intodepartmental arrangements. The Arton Wilson Committee, which heard evidence from the Council, has already recommended (Cmd. 9732) further devolution to wales within the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Similarrecommendations affecting other Departments are to be expected when the Councilreports this summer, and I shall then discuss them with my colleagues.49938
6. There will no doubt be requests, in Parliamentary Questions or otherwise,for the Government to state their views on the petition in the near future. Ipropose, subject to the agreement of my colleagues, to say that the Governmentmaintain the view that a separate Parliament would not be in the best interestsof the Principality.G. LL.-G.Home Office, S.W.1,15th May, 1956.PETITION1. We the people of Wales who have signed this Petition declare that wales is a nation which lived for many centuries under its own national institutions andwhich in face of many difficulties has maintained itself to the present day as anational community.2. That we believe that this nation is now in dire peril of losing its people,its land, its language and its traditions.3. That we are also convinced that the life of the nation cannot be savedand its great natural resources properly developed industrially, culturally andspiritually without self-government.4. That your honourable House with its centralised form of legislativemachinery is precluded from adequately dealing with the separate problems of wales and that self-government within the framework of the United kingdom should accrue to the good Government both of Wales and of the other parts ofthe United Kingdom.5. Inasmuch therefore as Wales has the same moral right to self-government as the Atlantic Charter proclaims for all nations we pray your honourable house to promote an Act of Parliament to secure for Wales a Parliament with adequatelegislative authority in Welsh affairs.
