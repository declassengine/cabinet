(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(56) 1376th June, 1956DISARMAMENTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 17th May, my colleagues approved the proposals I put forward i.oC. P. (56) 117 for a new One-Stage Disarmament Plan and authorised me to explore with the United States, Canadian and French Governments thepossibility of putting forward at the next meeting of the disarmament commission agreed proposals on these lines (CM. (56) 37th Conclusions,Minute 5).2.        I now circulate the draft of a plan for the consideration of mycolleagues.    The matter is of some urgency since the disarmament commission is due to meet on 3rd July and time will be required to securethe agreement of the American, Canadian and French Governments toproceed with us on these lines.3. There is, I think, only one point which may present difficulty.This is the nuclear provision in paragraphs 6 and 11 of the Plan.    Duringthe discussion by the Cabinet on 17th May it was pointed out that we must take care to ensure that any proposals for nuclear limitations did nothamper our ability to carry out our own nuclear defence programme.I am, however,  satisfied that the Plan as drafted takes care of this.All we are committed to during the one stage is the drafting of plans forthe control of future production of nuclear materials with a view to ensuring the eventual cessation of weapons manufacture.    But the actualcessation will not take place until a later stage and after a further WorldDisarmament Conference has decided whether to take this step &quot;in thelight of the prevailing international situation&quot;.     Paragraph 11 of the plan is so drafted as to enable us to maintain that political settlements mustprecede the execution of the plans for stopping the manufacuture of nuclearv/weapons and that this must also be accompanied by further agreedreductions in armed forces and conventional armaments.    I think we can also be certain that the difficulties of getting agreement to plans for effective inspection and control of nuclear production are in themselveslikely to give us adequate time.4. We may have difficulty in getting American and French agreement to these modest nuclear pro visions.    They are very concerned about thefourth country problem;  and they may well argue that because of itsurgency the cessation of nuclear weapon manufacture should come withina one-stage plan and should not depend upon political settlements and on further conventional disarmament.     This was certainly the Americanview when they put forward their own One-Stage Plan during the recentmeetings of the Sub-Committee.    On the other hand in view of the recentCOPY NO.CABINET
Russian volte face on nuclear disarmament there can hardly be anycomplaints from that quarter of the inadequacy of our nuclear proposals,5.        I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that I should seek thesupport of the United States, French and Canadian Governments for a four-Power initiative in the Disarmament Commission on the lines ofthe attached draft Plan.s0 Li.Foreign Office, S.W.1.5th June, 1956.
JOINT WESTERN PROPOSAL  - ArT OUTLINE PLAIT FORPARTIAL DISARM MEET IN ONE PHASEThe Delegations of Canada;, France, United Kingdom and UnitedStates submit this outline of a  one-phase plan which is designed to been acted in present world conditions, and to be a beginning to disarmament by agreement.      It is a first step, aiming at increasinginternational confidence, so that more extensive disarmament mayfollow under a comprehensive plan.      Its objectives ares-(i)    to reduce the armed forces of the United States, soviet union and China to 2.5 million and those of France and theUnited Kingdom to 750,000;(ii)    to increase international confidence so that more extensivedisarmament may follow;(Iii)    to give protection against surprise attach;(iv)    to institute an international control organisation tosupervis e disarmament;(v)    to initiate measures to bring the nuclear threat under control;(vi)    to reduce the armed forces of other states to levelsconsiderably below those of the five powers.Pisa rma ment P r ogramme2.     All participating states undertake on the coming into force ofthe Treaty not to increase their armed forces, conventional armaments and military expenditure above existing levels.      These levels shallbe declared and substantiated by providing military blue-prints andbudgetary and accounting documents.3.      When the Control Organisation has reported that it is ready to supervise reductions of armaments and armed forces in the territories concerned, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, France and theUnited Kingdom begin to carry out the reductions described inparagraph 1.      These measures will be accompanied by consequentialreductions in conventional armaments and military expenditures.L\.,      The other participating states begin to reduce their armed forces and conventional armaments as soon as the levels to which theyshould reduce have been agreed at an international disarmamentconference.5.      Upon the completion of the reductions by the five great powers, a limitation of nuclear test explosions cones into effect.6.      The Control Organisation then draws up plans for the control of future production of fissionable materials with a view to ensuring the cessation of the manufacture of nuclear weapons.      In doing 50 itco-operates with and draws upon the experience of the InternationalAtomic Energy Agency and receives all necessary assistance and facilities from producer states.Protection against Surprise Attach7*      To give increasing protection against surprise attach there shallbe established in the territories of all participating states, on abasis of reciprocity and under the authority of the international control Organisation,(a)    control posts based at strategic centres such as large ports,railway junctions, main motor highways and aerodromes and/ with
(b)    a system of aerial surveys, which will be progressivelyintroduced.     As confidence grows and the disarmamentprogramme develops, it will be extended both as regards thenumber of flights and the areas covered..2 -ternational Control System8.      There shall be an international control organisation to supervise the execution of the plan.      The limitations and reductionsshall begin when the Executive&apos; Committee accepts a report from theDirector-General that the control organisation is ready to function.9.      In order to guarantee the effective supervision of thedisarmament programme, the control organisation shall, in particular,(i) operate mobile and resident inspection teams;(ii) employ financial inspectors;(iii) conduct aerial surveys;(iv) have access to all objects of control;(v) have the right to make surprise visits to objects of control(vi)    take appropriate measures for supervising the agreedlimitations of nuclear test explosions;(vii)    give instructions to any individual &quot;whom it considersresponsible for a breach of the Treaty   to cease the allegedmalpractice, pending investigation by the ExecutiveCommittee or Security Council.Suspension   Clause10,      If the Executive Committee considers that- an irregularitywhich is covered by Chapter VII of the Charter has occurred, it shallimmediately inform the Security Council or General Assembly, and shallsuspend such of the provisions of the Treaty as it may consider necessary, pending a decision under the Charter by the security council or General Assembly,Further- Disarmament11.    When this programme has been completed, a disarmamentconference shall be convened to consider, in the.light of the prevailing international situation, how the plans for stopping the production of nuclear weapons are to be implemented and what further reductions in armed forces and conventional.armamentscan be carried out.
