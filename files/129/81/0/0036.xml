FUTURE OF THE ROYAL JORDANIAN AIR FORCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Secretary of State for AirPresent position the R.J.A.F. has one Squadron of Vampires (10 U.E.) whichwere a gift from Pier Majesty&apos;s Government.    It also has some trainers,light transport and reconnaissance aircraft.    No development planexists but earlier this year the King instructed his R.A.F. Air adviser to work out a plan on the basis of using Venoms - the logical step.Development Plan2.        On 22nd May,  1956, King Hussein told the Air Adviser that theR. J.A.F. must catch up with its neighbours.    He proposed that Jordanshould have 12 swept wing aircraft in 1957 and 12 more in 1958.40 Jordanians should be trained in the United Kingdom as pilots, startingin 1957.     The King wished to retain the R.J,A,F.&apos;s connection withthe United Kingdom but he was under pressure to accept aid from else-where.    He commissioned the Air Adviser, who was due to visit thiscountry, to obtain Her Majesty&apos;s Governments views on his proposals.The Air Adviser is due to return to Jordan this week.     The King expectshim to have Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs initial reactions.Comment3.        Militarily, three Fighter/Ground Attack Squadrons (2 withGwept-wing aircraft) is a sound aim.    But the development proposed is too rapid.     The R.A.F. could probably find training places for 40 pilotsbut training would take until 1959.    As to aircraft, if orders were placed soon, Jordan might get 24 Hunters between late 1957 and mid-1958 at a cost of about  2-^- millions.     24 Gnats could be delivered betweenearly 1958 and 1959 at a cost of just over  1*- millions.    Either air-craft is suitable but the Gnats are cheaper and easier to operate.4.        12 Venoms could be supplied by mid-1 957 for about  0.35millions.     The King is unlikely to accept Venoms unless coupled witha decision to order swept-wing fighters.    Even then a good deal ofpersuasion might be needed as the King will have to wait about 18 monthsf or swept-wing aircraft which he might get earlier from elsewhere.5. Militarily the best plan would be for the R. J. A.F, to acquire12 Venoms in 1957 and to order 24 Gnats for delivery in 1958/59.     Pilottraining would be carried out in this country.     The Jordan Governmenthave already been negotiating with Follands about Gnats.COPY NO.CABINETSECRETC.P.(56) 1365th June, 1956
1^1S.L,N.B.5th June, 19566.        The King did not say how this development programme was to be financed except to mention that some money might come from theS.3 millions a year Jordan hopes to get from the pipeline negotiationswith an -American company.7.        In 1955/56 the R.J.A.F. budget was  347,000.    For thecurrent year it is  660, 000.-   The additional capital costs of the pilottraining and supply of aircraft suggested in paragraph 5 above wouldbe about  24- millions spread over three years.     There would also be anincrease in operating costs which, for a three-squadron force (2 Gnats,1 Venom) might amount to  600, 000 a year by the end of 1959.    This isa very rough estimate and takes no account of any compensating savings which would arise if the existing Vampires were disposed of.conclusions.        In our view it is necessary to give the King an early indication of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments views but these depend primarily on our political and financial policy towards Jordan.    We think there are three courses(a) To accept the King&apos;s plan in principle;   to give himsome idea of the cost;   draw attention to the factthat it will not be possible to supply aircraft (ortrain pilots) to meet the time-table proposed andto enquire how it is proposed to finance theexpansion.    We recommend this course should be rejected on practical grounds.(b) To reject the proposals as unrealistic and beyondJordan&apos;s capacity to sustain.     This would almost certainly drive Jordan to seek supplies elsewhere/here.(c) To say that Her Majesty&apos;s Government have givenpreliminary study to the proposals and think on military and practical grounds that they should be revised on the lines indicated in paragraph 5 ofthis paper.    If these proposals are acceptable tothe Jordan Government, they will presumably put them forward officially with an indication of how they intend them to be financed.9.        We advocate course (c) and suggest that these views should be conveyed to the King by the Air Adviser.    But we recognise that it may bedifficult to persuade the King to wait until January, 1958 for the firstswept wing aircraft, and that there is a danger that his impatience maydrive him to accept outside offers.    We should hope to be able to judge the risk of this by his reactions to our advice.
