Ministers may find that the paper providesuseful background for the Cabinefs discussion on Wednesday,2nd May.(Signed)   NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S.W.I.,1st May, 1956.
FUTURE OF N.A.T.O.The conclusion to be drawn from the Geneva Conferenceand subsequent statements by the Soviet leaders is  that weare faced with a protracted period of &quot;competitive co-existence&quot;during which the Russians will seel: to undermine the strengthand unity of the West and to lure the Germans into the easternorbit.     In this situation the aims of Western policy must be(a) to bind the Federal Republic to the West, and(b) to maintain,  and if possible,  develop, Western solidarity.2*.     These aims are universally accepted, but it is leas easy to devise the best method of attaining them in face of the new and subtler Soviet tactics,.     The problem which faces the Westis not only to maintain the vital defensive shield which, throughN.A.T.O., 8.E.A.T.O.  and the Bagdad Pact, has been built upto parr^/ the Soviet military threat, but also to meet theSoviet political and economic offensive which is now beamedon South East Asia and the Middle East, where the Westernnations have grave difficulties in aligning their policies.3.      If the West is to compete successfully, it must marshal andcombine the resources, material and spiritual, of the new world as well as the old.     The.desired unity of purpose and action must be sought through those international organisations whichbring together the largest number of Western countries and inwhich the full participation and support of the United Kingdom,the United States and Canada are assured.      This points to developing the scope of discussion and popular appeal ofN.A.T.O.  and 0,E.E.C.U-,      This method seems equally the best for attaining our otherbasic aim of binding Germany to the West.      In the Atlanticframework the new Germany will find the necessary scope for development and the wider opportunities and benefits whichshould make her less inclined to turn eastwards and lessconscious of her purely European problems.     The Germans cannotbe bound to the West by institutional links alone.      Thesolidity and permanence of Germany&apos;s connexion with the Westwill depend on a sense of community and common interest:indeed,  in the final analysis,  on her assessment of theadvantages she derives from that connexion.     Those advantagesare likely to be greater in an Atlantic association thanthey can ever be in a purely European one.      The presentGerman leaders, whilst conscious of Germany&apos;s growing poweramd desirous of extending German influence to areas outside europe, seem attracted by the concept that her power and influence should be exerted and co-ordinated through N.A.T.O.5o     There is a general desire among the members of N.A.T.O.to develop the scope of its activities.      This desire wasechoed all round the table at the last Ministerial Meeting ofN.A.T.O.      There is at the same time a growing belief,particularly among unofficial and parliamentary supporters of the
Atlantic,Alliance,    that N.A. T. 0.  has failed to ac hi eye full papularsupport because it has been too exclusively   identified with military matters.    This belief has crystallised in the demandfor a more determined effort to make Article 2 activities a genuine part of N. A. T. 0. &apos;s work.fa.      Failure to respond to this current of opinion would givecurrency to the notion that N. A. T. 0. na longer corresponds tothe real needs of the time and we should run grave risk that its military structure would fall into disrepute and decay.7.      Apart from our vital need of N. A. T. 0. as the essentialshield of these islands, we have strong interest in building up itsnon-de fence a spec to. It is the one Western organisation which includes the United States of America as a full member and represents a real power grouping.      It is our best counter to the feelingimplicit in the Messina plans and never entirely absent from american thinking that if only Europe could be set on her feetthe United States of America need concern themselves no longerwith this Continent.      In N. A. T. Ca  the Americans are receivingas well as giving and our claims on their support are mere sure ofa hearing.8.      It should therefore be the aim of British policy to make N. A. T. 0,a focus of Western solidarity by using it as a forum for high-levelexchanges of opinion on topical problems both in and beyond theNorth Atlantic area and on the general lines of Western strategy inthe Cold War.      This does not mean that N, A. T. 0.   should seek tobeccme an executive agency, nor set up new or separate machinery ofits own to compete with existing organisations.     In particular it should not attempt to trespass on the present functions of the. E. E. C. nor exclude their extension to new fields of european co-operation.      N.A.T. 0.  should be used rather as the means of ensuring that member countries in treating European issuesin existing organisations do not lose sight of the fundamental needfor Europe of maintaining the ties across the Atlantic.9.      The greater emphasis on the political and economic facetsof the North Atlantic Treaty might be accompanied by some positivereduction in the emphasis at present laid on military planning.This should, however, be a gradual process because the jointmilitary effort undoubtedly helps to promote political solidarityand has been very educative for the smaller countries.      The rightway of arriving at the proper balance between the defence and non-defence aspects of N. A.T. 0,  would therefore seem to be to ensurethat the agenda of future Ministerial meetings, and particularly ofthe December meeting when the Annual Review is taken, make adequateallowance for discussion of political and economic matters so thatthe communiques could give a general picture of the range ofN. A.T.O.  activities as a whole.      The follow-up work of the secretariat, and eventually its machinery would have to be adjusted to conform to the new spectrum of Ministerial discussion.10.    To this end we should seek to broaden the activities ofN. A.T.O.  in the following directions:(a)    Political ConsultationUseful political consultations took place lastyear, mainly in connexion with Pour-Power, talks.    Thishabit should be encouraged and extended to all politicalquestions affecting members of the Alliance not onlyin. the N. A. T. 0. area but in all parts of the world.These discussions are likely to be franker and moreprofitable if they are held in restricted session,both when Ministers meet and in the Permanent Council.In this way one may hope that the members of N. A. T. 0.will gradually develop a community of view and identity of policy at lost on all problems bearing on the cold war. -2-
(Id)   Economic ConsultationThe discussion of economic problems related to strategy-could usefully he undertaken by NATO.    The North atlantic council has already undertaken a study of the relative economicstrengths of the Soviet bloc and the Atlantic Alliance.    Thereis scope for further work on the Soviet economic offensive, wherethe function of NATO would be to prepare and circulate intell-igence reports, to assess Soviet intentions and to discuss (ofcourse in secret) the general line of strategy and progress of counter-measures.    Other topics which might be discussed in NATOare the economic problems of military obsolescence and the conflicting needs of investment in defence production.There is in addition a movement in NATO for embarking on more general economic discussions.    Mr.  Pearson has for instancesuggested that Ministers might comment on economic prospectsgenerally, or review current international trade and financialpolicies and the functions of existing organisations.    Apart fromthe Canadians, the Italians and Germans are known to be keen forsuch discussions.    These proposals are of a rather different character, and it is at least doubtful whether the NATO councils constituted to occupy itself usefully with such matters onwhich it can take no effective action.    The problem here istherefore the length to which we should carry our opposition toany broadening of the scope of discussions to include general economic matters in this way.    Since it is our aim to encouragemember countries to look to NATO as the cornerstone of theirpolicy, it might be inexpedient to come out in direct opposition and better to try to steer discussion towards the economic topicswhich are more directly related to the cold war.(c) Parliamentary activitiesParliamentary interest is essential if NATO is to havepopular appeal.    The meeting of NATO parliamentarians held inParis last summer should be repeated and become an annual event.We should ensure that a strong    - United.   Kingdom   teamgoes to this year&apos;s meeting due to be held in November.    In thelong term an Atlantic Assembly might develop but it is still too early to suggest its shape or how it might absorb any existingEuropean assemblies.(d) PublicityWe are supporting in the North Atlantic Council a number ofschemes designed to publicise NATO.    They include proposals fora Military Tattoo, a Youth Sports Meeting, etc.    As many of these schemes as possible are intended to be self-supporting financially.A survey of Article 2 achievements is being prepared by the secretariat.    It is hoped that this paper will provide usefulmaterial for publicity by all NATO members and may stimulatefurther action by member governments.11.    If this policy is to be carried through it is important to preserve high quality United Kingdom representatives in the NATOSecretariat, the NATO military organization, and the UnitedKingdom Delegation.
