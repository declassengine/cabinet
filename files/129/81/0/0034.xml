1J. hi U(THjS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)iSECRETC.P.(56) 134 COPY NO. H&amp;zz4 th June, 1956.CABINETTHE SCHOOL BUILDING programme memorandum by the Minister of education in November, 1954, the Cabinet agreed to a much-neededincrease in school building, more especially of secondary schools in rural areas, which had come off badly compared with the towns(C.C.(54) 80th Conclusions, Minute 4).     Local authorities got to workon the enlarged programme for 1955/56, but shortages of various kindswere holding up a good many projects when in February last theChancellor of the Exchequer asked me to cut  10 millions off the 1956/57programme which had, with Treasury consent, been given to authoritiessome months previously.2.        I pointed out that as the carry-over from 1955/56 was likelyto be more than  10 millions it wuld be necessary to adopt sternermeasures.    We therefore agreed   -(a) that I would do whatever was necessary to see that 20 millions of starts should be carried forward from 1955/56 into 1956/57;(b) that the total amount of work to be started in thefirst half of 1956/57 should not exceed  25 millions;(c) that the total amount to be started in 1956/57 shouldnot exceed  47 millions,  subject to a later reviewof the allocation for the second half of the year.If the forecast of the carry-over proved correct the result would beto push not  10 millions but  30 millions of work out of the 1956/57programme, i.e.  20 millions carry-over +  57 millions authorised in 1956/57 minus  47 millions allowed to start ^  30 millions.But in the event the carry-over at 31st March last was 32 millions not  20 millions.3.        The Chancellor would like me to disregard the fact that 12 millions less schools were started before the arbitrary date of31st March than the forecast and to stick to  47 millions of starts forthe whole of 1956/57.      This would mean that  42 millions, or three-quarters of the schools already approved for the current year, wouldbe postponed till 1957/58.    Such a heavy reduction would rouse a stormbecause most of the schools in the current programme must be started this year to be completed in time for the maximum increase in
the secondary school roll, which occurs in September, 1958. If,therefore, I do as the Chancellor wishes we make certain of acuteshortages of secondary school places in the years 1958 and 1959.4.        I ask therefore to be allowed to tell the local authorities thatwe are working to the following time-table:(  millions:  current prices)1956/57 1956/57 1957/58 1957/58(first half) (second half) (first half) (second half)30 25 30 30and to put this to them as an extension of the 1956/57 programme to30th September, 1957 to be followed by a programme for 1957/58 of half the expected size.5.        In short, school building would lose a whole six months1programme.    That the impact on the building industry would be merely to hold the level of starts is due to the fact that I have to cut down ona policy of sharp expansion to which we have repeatedly committedourselves.    To go any further would be inconsistent with thetechnical education programme which rests on adequate secondary schools.D.E.Ministry of Education, W. 1.4th June, 1956.
