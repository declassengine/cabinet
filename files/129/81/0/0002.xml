$HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)j--&quot;-------------................SECRETCP. (56) 102COPY NO25th April, 1956CABINETAGRICULTURE:  DISCIPLINARY POWERS and security OF TENUREMemorandum by the Lord Privy Seal, the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and FoodAs requested by the Cabinet (C. M. (56) 24th Conclusions, Minute 7)we have re-considered the proposal for an enquiry into the disciplinary actions of the Agricultural Ministers, and the provisions for security of tenure for tenant-farmers.2.      Assuming there is general agreement that our ultimate object isto secure relaxation of the present security of tenure and modification orrepeal of the disciplinary powers, it seems to us that the main questionwhich arises is one of timing so as to avoid controversy just beforeelection time.3.      We have all reached the conclusion that there would now be practically no hope of a limited enquiry being completed, and legislationbeing framed and passed in the 1957/58 session.4.      The alternative is a more extensive enquiry (but short of a RoyalCommission, which would have to cover far too wide and controversial afield) culminating in a report soon after the new Parliament has beenelected.    We attach as an appendix the sort of terms of reference wehave in mind for such an enquiry.5.      We think, however, that before embarking on such an enquirythere would be great advantages if the Agricultural Ministers were toenter into discussions with the leaders of the agricultural industry.These discussions would cover a general review of the working of the agriculture Acts and the Agricultural Holdings Acts in the light of theexperience of the last eight or nine years, with particular reference tothe Governments disciplinary powers and to the relationship of landlord and tenant.. 6.      It is possible that such discussions might disclose sufficientcommon ground on the relaxation of security of tenure and the modifica-tion of Part II to justify legislation in the 1957/58 session.    This v/ould be the best result.    But in any event they would serve to show more clearly how strong feeling was on the controversial problems, and thepossible solutions of them.7.      If, as seems likely, no acceptable basis for amendments can befound, these discussions would, nevertheless, have served a useful purpose.    They would provide a justification for the institution of an
independent enquiry, and they would postpone the appointment of aCommittee until the spring of 1957.     This would considerably reduce therisk that the Committee would report before the next election;  whereas,if a Committee were appointed now, there would be a danger of its reportappearing before the next election.0.      We mink that it would be wise to announce the proposed discussions at the same time as discussions with the industry on longer term assurances and other aspects of long-term policy now under consideration as a result of the recent Price Review.    Subject to agreement with theTreasury, it is hoped that the Agricultural Ministers will be ready forsuch discussions in July.summary.      We recommend that -(i)  the Agricultural Ministers should be authorised to start joint discussions with the industry on possibleamendments to the Agriculture Acts and theAgricultural Holdings Acts - particularly on security of tenure and disciplinary powers;(ii)  the discussions should be announced at the sametime as the discussions with the industry onlonger term assurances and other aspects of long-term policy, for which we should try to beready by July;(iii)  if the discussions should disclose sufficientcommon ground to form the basis of effectiveamending legislation, this should be framed and passed in the 1957/58 ses sion;(iv) if not, a Committee of enquiry with more extensiveterms of reference should be set up in the spring of 1957.R.A.B.J.S.D.H.A.24th April, 1956,
appendix draft Terms of Reference&quot;To review, in the light of the need to promote the progressive development of agriculture in Great Britain   with due regard to therights of the individual, to the provision of opportunities for new entrants to farming, and to the support provided by the Exchequer to theagricultural industry, the responsibilities, rights and duties of land-owners, tenants and owner-occupiers in relation to one another and tothe State, under the law relating to agricultural land;   and to recommendwhat measures should be taken in this regard in the interests of goodestate management and good husbandry. &quot;These terms of reference would cover, in addition to disciplinary actions and security of tenure, other important aspects of the landlord-tenant relationship such as the responsibility for the maintenance of fixedequipment, the tenant&apos;s right to make improvements, and the methods of determining farm rents in the event of disagreement.    All these questions are of fundamental importance in securing the efficient management andfarming of agricultural land, and the enquiry would therefore form alogical whole, while avoiding the contentious subject of guaranteed pricesunder Part I.
