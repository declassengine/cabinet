SECRET:v.&apos;&apos;&quot;h.iil&apos;,i.&apos;;-&quot;.:/C.P. (56) 14311th June, 1956DEATH PENALTY (ABOLITION) bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh AffairsThe purpose of this paper is to report to the Cabinet the conclusions reached at a meeting of the Ministers principally concerned, under theChairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal, on the line to be undertaken on certain points that will arise on the Report Stage of the Death Penalty(Abolition) Bill.     Owing to the terms of the Parliament Act we cannotbe sure that amendments made in the House of Lords will be incorporated in the Bill.     The only safe course, therefore, is to arrange for the amendments necessary to put the Bill into proper form to be put down on Report.The application of the Bill to courts-martial2.      The promoters intend the Bill to apply to courts-martial whereversitting, and the Attorney-General inclines to the view that as at presentdrafted it does so apply.    The Colonial Secretary and the service ministers attach importance to retaining the death penalty for conviction of a serviceman by court martial on a charge of murder committed on active service.    A serviceman who murders a member of the civilpopulation is usually handed over to the local courts, but this is not always possible, and sometimes not desirable, under active serviceconditions;   and where it is not there is likely to be local resentment ifthe court martial cannot impose the death penalty, which would havebeen the penalty in the civil courts.     On the other hand there may beresentment in this country if a serviceman who commits a murder over-seas is sentenced to death by court martial, whereas if he had committedit in this country the sentence would have been one of life imprisonment.The normal rule is that the court martial penalty for a civil offence isthe same as the penalty in England for the same offence.    While thepoint is a difficult one my colleagues think that on the whole the death penalty should be retained for conviction of a serviceman by court martialon a charge of murder committed on active service, and I am, therefore,arranging for a Private Member to put down a suitable amendment, andthe Minister of Defence will speak in support of it.     The amendmentwill cover murder(a)   on de facto active service;   that is, service in or witha force which is engaged in operations against anenemy (including armed mutineers, armed rebels,armed rioters and pirates), or which is engaged in aforeign country in operations for the protection of life and property;   andCOPY NO.CABINET
-fl if316(b)  on &quot;deemed&quot; active service, which is active servicebrought into existence by a declaration which theGovernor of a Colony or the general officer command-ing the force has power to make, with the approval ofthe Secretary of State, if it appears to him necessaryto do so by reason of the imminence of active service or of the recent existence of active service.A Private Member is also being asked to put down a narroweramendment, covering only de facto active service, since the House ofCommons might be prepared to accept this, but not the wider amendmentmentioned above.    It is desirable that the Governments views on this problem should be explained to a Pa.rty meeting before the Report Stage.Murder by a person already serving a sentence of life imprisonment3.      In Committee, Sir Hugh Lucas-Tooth carried an amendmentpreserving the death penalty for murder by a person already serving a sentence of imprisonment for life.    I am asking him to put down further amendments on Report making it clear that, where the murder is a jointone, and only one of the persons concerned is serving a sentence of lifeimprisonment, that person only shall be liable to the death penalty;   and making procedural provision so that a jury are not prejudiced by theknowledge that the accused is serving a life sentence.4.      It is also necessary to make it clear whether a person who hasbeen sentenced to imprisonment for life is liable to the death penalty fora murder committed at any time thereafter or only for murder committedwhile in prison or unlawfully at large.    I am giving Sir Hugh Lucas-Toothalternative amendments and asking him to put down whichever giveseffect to his intentions.Amendments to remove the references to suspension5.      The Bill at present provides for its termination by Order inCouncil made on the presentation of Addresses by both Houses ofParliament at any time after five years and before ten years from thepassing of the Act.    The Government advised the House in the debates on 16th February and 12th March that there should be no suspension ofthe death penalty because it was a mistake to suppose that there could beany useful experiment on this subject, at any rate during so short aperiod, and because in a matter of such importance any further changeought to be made by legislation.    Accordingly, I propose to inviteMr. Silverman to put down amendments removing all the references tosuspension and making this a straightforward abolition Bill;  if lieprefers not to put them down himself I shall ask another Private member to do so.Amendments applying to Scotland and other drafting amendments6.      Certain drafting amendments are desirable, particularly in theapplication of the Bill to Scotland.     In addition, it is desirable to abolish the death penalty for shooting with intent to murder or disable, which isa capital offence in Scotland, though an amendment to do this may beheld to be out of order.     The Secretary of State for Scotland is handingthe necessary Scottish amendments to a Scottish Member, and I amgiving the remainder to an English Member.
4 G 9Ji t) f,jRemoval to Broadmoor of persons sentenced to life imprisonment for murder7.      There are likely to be some murderers who, though not certifiablyinsane, are so mentally abnormal that they cannot be released for a very long time but ought not to be kept indefinitely in prison conditions.    Weshall not be able for some years to come to provide a special institutionfor them but I should like to take power to remove such prisoners toBroadmoor on the certificate of three doctors (one not to be a memberof the prison service) that this is desirable.    Some of my colleaguesthink that this proposal would be controversial and that it would be better not to put it down at this stage.    Accordingly I do not propose to put downan amendment on Report, but I hope that it will be possible for an amend-ment in this sense to be made in the House of Lords.Use of the Whips8.      Although the Government have some responsibility for seeing thatthe Bill leaves the House in workable shape,any proposal to put on theWhips for any of the above amendments may be misunderstood, and it isproposed that there should be a free vote on all points.     If necessary amendments were rejected in the Commons but passed in the Lords therewould be less objection to putting on the Whips to ensure the Commons&apos;agreement with these amendments at a later stage.     This involvessome risk in view of the Parliament Act, but it seems probable that thePlouse of Commons will be willing to pass genuine tidying up amendmentswithout the Whips.9.      I ask the Cabinet to endorse the arrangements set out in thisX^aper and to agree that there should be a free vote on Report.G, LL. -G.Home Office, S.W.1.9th June, 1956.
