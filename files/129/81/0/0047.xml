AnnexRecommendation (No. 98) concerning Holidays with pay. The main provision of this Recommendation lays down the workers&apos;entitlement to an annual paid holiday proportionate to the length of service with one or more employers and consisting of not less than two working weeks fortwelve months&apos; service. Other provisions deal with the remuneration to be paid and with detailed conditions affecting the duration of the holiday. There arespecific requirements for longer holidays for young workers and on thecircumstances in which absences from work should not affect holiday entitlement.2. The Recommendation may be put into effect &quot; by means of public or voluntary action, through legislation, statutory wage-fixing machinery, collective agreements or arbitration awards &quot; or by any other means appropriate to nationalconditions. It suggests that Governments might encourage the conclusion of collective agreements, or assist in establishing joint voluntary machinery, for determing paid holidays. A specific responsibility is, however, placed onGovernments to &quot; call into action all appropriate constitutional or legalmachinery &quot; when voluntary methods do not give speedy and satisfactory results.3. In this country, the general principle of holidays with pay was endorsed by the Government in 1938, and the Holidays with Pay Act, 1938, empoweredstatutory wage-fixing bodies to fix paid holidays for workers within their scope.Since then the principle has been widely accepted and applied both throughvoluntary collective agreements and through statutory wage-fixing bodies.Although most of the working population in the United Kingdom now enjoy notless than two weeks paid holiday, this is not universal. Moreover,, in matters of detail, practice in the United Kingdom, which varies from industry to industry, is out of conformity with the particular requirements of the Recommendation.4. A more important difficulty arises from the overriding responsibility whichthe Recommendation places upon Governments to take action in the event of thefailure of voluntary methods. The Recommendation does not simply lay down the broad principle of holidays with pay, but specifies the minimum holiday period and certain of the conditions under which paid holidays are to be granted. it covers a very wide field of employment in which holidays with pay, like otherworking conditions, are, in general, settled by voluntary collective agreements orby statutory wage-fixing bodies, and, the resulting practice is only in partialconformity with its provisions. Acceptance of the Recommendation would imply that the Government were prepared to intervene in order to ensure conformity.Such intervention would be entirely foreign to our system of industrial relations.5. It is proposed therefore that the Recommendation should not be accepted.In the White Paper announcing the Governmenfs decision and explaining thereasons for it the opportunity would be taken to emphasise the Governmenfssupport of the principle of holidays with pay and the wide extent to which theyare, in fact, enjoyed by workers in the United Kingdom.
