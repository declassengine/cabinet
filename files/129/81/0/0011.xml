secret.P.(56) 1111st May, 1956CABINETCANCER OF THE LUNGMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal in accordance with the recent Cabinet decision (C.M.(56) 30thConclusions, Minute 7), I have discussed cancer of the lung with theLord President, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, and the Minister of Health.2.      We have agreed that the Minister of Health cannot defer a state-ment for very long, not only because of his statutory duty to divulgeadvice which he receives from the Standing Medical Advisory Committee,but also because of the increasing degree of public concern.3.      Nevertheless, any statement on this subject should not involve theGovernment too deeply in responsibility for dealing with the possible consequences of excessive smoking.    From the point of view of socialhygiene, cancer of the lung is not a disease like tuberculosis;  nor shouldthe Government assume too lightly the odium of advising the general public on their personal tastes and habits where the evidence of the harmwhich may result is not conclusive.4.      We feel, therefore, that the Minister&apos;s statement should, as faras possible, rest, without comment, upon the views of the medicalexperts, and it should aim to hold the balance evenly betweenunnecessarily alarming public opinion, and dismissing the whole question as unimjxsrtant.    A statement falling between these two extremes wouldbe as clear as can be expected in the present state of our knowledge, andshould also take care of the substantial Treasury interest involved.5.      The results of the latest researches by Dr. Doll and professor Kill are thought likely to be published within the next month or two.    Any Government statement should, if possible, anticipate thispublication;   and it should do so with the minimum of ostentation - i.e.,preferably by way of an ordinary Parliamentary Question rather than bymeans of a full-blown statement.6.      The Minister of Health has an opportunity to answer a Questionof this kind on 7th May, after which it will be a good many weeks before he can rely on being reached again in the ordinary course of Questions.I suggest, therefore, that he should be authorised to give the answerwhich is appended to this paper, and has been drafted on the basis of copy NO.

&quot;J pthe principles indicated above.    It incorporates amendments suggested bythe Lord President and the Chancellor of the Exchequer since I held mymeeting with the interested Ministers.R.A.B.Office of the Lord Privy Seal,S.W.1.1st May, 1956.DRAFT PARLIAMENTARY ANSWERSince my predecessor made a statement in February, 1954,investigations into the possible connection of smoking and cancer of thelung have been proceeding in this and other countries.     Two knowncancer producing agents have been identified in tobacco smoke, but whether they have a direct role in producing lung cancer, and if so what,has not been proved.2.      The extent of the problem should be neither minimised norexaggerated.    The number of deaths from cancer of the lung has risen from 2, 206 in 1931 to 17, 271 last year.     To place the figures inperspective - in 1954, for men aged 45-74, out of every thousand deaths77 were from bronchitis, 85 were from cancer of the lung and 112 were from strokes and apoplexies.    Deaths of women from cancer of thelung are still not very significant and represent a small fraction of thetotal.3.      The Chairman of a Committee of the Medical Research council which has been investigating the subject considers that the fact that acausal agent has not yet been recognised should not be allowed to obscurethe fact that there is, statistically, an incontrovertible association between cigarette smoking and the incidence of lung cancer.    the statistical evidence from this and other countries to which he referstends to show that mortality from cancer of the lung is twenty timesgreater amongst heavy cigarette smokers than amongst non-smokers.4.      The Government consider that the public should be kept informed of all the relevant information as and when it becomes available as theresult of research which goes steadily forward with full government support.
