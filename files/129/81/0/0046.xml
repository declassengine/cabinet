i n confidential r/   fO.P.(56)  1U6 copy NO.  --   &apos;9th June. 1956CABINETREDUNDANCY AND EMPLOYMENTMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the present and threatened redundancy among workers inthe motor car industry in the Midlands has raised questions ofthe Government&apos;s responsibility and powers to assist in theirtransfer to other employment and I think it may be convenient to my colleagues if I set out the present position.    Thisredundancy has been identified erroneously in the press and elsewhere with automation.    Automation is less likely to cause redundancy in the immediate future than Governmenteconomic policy and in any case it is immaterial whethera man is out of work as a result of automation,  the creditsqueeze,  export difficulties or anything else.20      As far as Government action can contribute in findingother employment for redundant workers, the powers which Ihave under the Employment and Training Act,  19hS are adequate.This Act gives me a general power to provide such facilities and services as I consider expedient for thepurpose of assisting persons to select, fit themselves for,obtain and retain employment suitable to their age and capacity, and I have also specific powers set out in the sameAct    to provide training courses and to meet or contribute to the cost of removal and resettlement of workers.    The Actgives effect to the objectives set out in the White paper on Employment Policy issued by the Coalition Government inMay, 19hh which laid down that in order to promote full employment the Government should be prepared to providetraining and to facilitate transfer of workers where necessary.3.      The main service of finding a man a suitable new jobas quickly as possible is carried out by Employment Exchanges,Comparatively little use has been made of the powers toprovide training and to facilitate transfer in the period afterthe main post-war resettlement for the reason that there hasbeen little or no need.    The following facilities are at presentoperating.(a) Financial assistance to workers to transfer from one area to another.(i) Advance of fares to any form of employment.(ii) Free fares to persons who live in districts whereemployment prospects are poor,  or to ex-Regularsand disabled persons for resettlement.    Those withhousehold responsibilities who transfer to work away from home are &apos; eligible foi. lodging allowar^es(2hs.6d.  a week) and subsequently for a refund of thecost of household removal.    Very few new cases arearising now.
i ? 9(b) Assistance in obtaining; lodgings - some help isgiven by the Exchanges through the maintenance oflodging lists.(c) Government Training: CentresThere are at present 16 of these Centres, all engaged ittraining for skilled occupations.    In the main, they arttrainingoisahled and ex-Regulars, but also small numbers of other able-bodied men who wish to qualify for skilled employment,    A wide range oftraining facilities is provided for the disabled,and a smaller, though still substantial, range for theex-Regulars.    Training for the other able-bodiedis limited to training in a few undermanned trades which are at the same time important to nationalneeds.    It is in most cases desirable,  and in somecases essential, to get full Trade Union co-operation in our training, and this applies particularly in thecase of engineering,  where I am at present facedwith strong Trade Union opposition to the trainingof any able-bodied.    Given that co-operation, whichmight be more readily forthcoming if it were aquestion of re-training displaced members of engineer!!^Unions for other jobs in the same industry I see no reason why the Training Centres should not makea contribution to the problem in so far as this maybe required in the comparatively few cases where the worker cannot find re-employment without substantialre-training.k.      I do not myself think that we are,facing any large-scalegeographical re-distribution of labour, but there must be,if our economic policy is to be successful, a considerablechange from job to job and some of these changes will involveremoval to othur districts.    While employment at the present level persists, many employers will,  and in my view should,themselves undertake a very considerable measure of assistanceto workers whom they are anxious to employ,    both byway of finding lodgings and paying fares, and it is the policyof both sides of industry that the main part of training shouldbe undertaken in industry and not in Government Training Centres.5a      Nevertheless it is desirable,  in my view,  that theGovernment should make clear that it has the powers to give assistance and will make such use of them as is necessary,.In this connection I am somewhat concerned that in my efforts to make a proper contribution to economy in government expenditure, which include the closing of three government training Centres,  and the closing of a number of EmploymentExchanges and a general reduction in the standard of service inthe Employment Exchanges,  all of which will have to be made known, the Government may lay itself open to public criticism.1 shall need to review this carefully in consultation with theChancellor.6.      I propose(a) to make clear in answer to an Opposition question whichis down for Answer on Tuesday,  12th June,  that theGovernment have the powers to give such assistance asis necessary, and has already in existence schemes whichup to now have met the need and that it will keepthe position under review;(b) to review these problems with the National joint advisory Council at its forthcoming meeting in July.I.M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.V/. 19th June, 1956 -2-
