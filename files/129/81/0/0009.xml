(56) 26th Conclusion,Minute 1) I circulate an appreciation of the strategic value of British Somalilandprepared by the Chiefs of Staff.W. M.Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,30th April, 1956.49856
STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF THE SOMALILAND PROTECTORATEIntroduction1. Our recent agreement with Ethiopia providing for the withdrawal of our military Administration from the Haud, and the approach of the grant of independence to the Trust Territory of Somalia in 1960, has made it necessary to reconsider our future policy in the Protectorate.2. This reconsideration of future policy is being carried out by the ColonialOffice and, in this connection, the Minister of Defence has asked us:  (a) To reaffirm our assessment of the strategic importance of the SomalilandProtectorate and of the minimum strategic rights which we should retain there if British control were relinquished.(b) To state the degree of importance which we attach to the achievement ofthese rights.(c) To state whether we regard the rights as- so important that a formal agreement embodying them is an essential pre-requisite to self-government.STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONSGeneral3. The Somaliland Protectorate offers strategic advantages somewhat similarto those of Aden, except that its port facilities are not sufficiently developed to beof any value to the Royal Navy. As our influence in the Suez Canal areadiminishes, so will the Southern Red Sea area assume for us an ever-increasing importance.4. There are, however, reasons why too great a degree of dependence upon our existing facilities in Aden may prove unwise in the future. These are:  (a) The Russians are at present attempting to undermine our Northern tier system of defence in the Middle East by subverting the Arab States inits rear.(b) In face of subversion by Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, possibly Sovietencouraged, coupled with internal disorders in the Aden Protectorate,we may eventually find that the Aden base would be less secure than itappears at present.(c) The grant of independence to Somalia in 1960 is bound to have anunsettling effect in Aden.5. We therefore feel that, in considering our possible requirements inSomaliland, we should not assume that Aden facilities will necessarily be adequateor secure for all purposes in the future.6. The situation would be worsened if, after gaining independence in 1960,Somalia fell under Egyptian or Russian influence. This would represent a directthreat to the security of Kenya and if this influence were also extended tothe Sudan, the security of all the British territories in East Africa would be threatened. We consider that retention of the airfields and other facilities inBritish Somaliland may well play a vital part in maintaining stability in North-EastAfrica. The relinquishment of British control of the Protectorate would make the effective use of these facilities more difficult and there would be a positive militaryadvantage in retaining our control as long as possible. If self-government iseventually granted, it is essential that our minimum strategic rights are safeguarded.Minimum Strategic Rights7. The Overflying and Air Staging Rights. As a result of the loss of ourunrestricted overflying rights in Egypt, the moyement of aircraft through theMiddle East will, after April 1956, depend not only on the goodwill of thosecountries which we wish to overfly, but also on their tacit approval for theoperation on which we are engaged. In addition the situation in the Sudan is uncertain, and it is possible that we may lose our overflying rights in this area. If
this happens, and in addition we lose the northern route through Syria or Turkey,our route, United Kingdom-Far East, would have to be redirected throughcentral Africa. Therefore the retention of overflying rights and air staging rights in Somaliland might be important. In addition, should Egypt and the Sudan denyus overflying rights, it would be desirable to be able to overfly Somaliland on theMiddle East-East Africa route.8. Stationing of Forces. We should retain the right to station forces inBritish Somaliland if the need arises. This would enable us to maintain stability in the area and would ensure our ability to make use of the staging facilities.9. Other Rights. It is desirable to have such rights of use and development in the ports as are required to support any forces which it may be necessary to station in the Protectorate.10. Oil. Oil prospecting is being carried out, and if this is successful, the strategic value of the Protectorate would be enhanced. We must therefore ensurethat we would have the right to develop any oil resources in the territory.The Necessity of a Formal Agreement11. Although the Somalis are at present well disposed towards us, we cannotbe certain that their attitude may not change, after self-government has beengranted, to one of aggressive nationalism.12. We therefore consider that these rights should be embodied in a formal agreement as an essential prerequisite to self-government&apos;.CONCLUSIONS13.   We conclude that:  (a) In view of recent events in the Middle East the strategic importance of the somali land Protectorate has increased.(b) If self-government were granted to the Protectorate it would be essentialto retain the following minimum strategic rights:  (i) Overflying and air staging rights.(ii) The right to station forces.(hi) Concessions in respect of possible oil and mineral production and pipeline facilities,(iv) Use and development of ports and anchorages.(c) The embodiment of the strategic rights in paragraph 13 (b) above is anessential prerequisite to self-government.
