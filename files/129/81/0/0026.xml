oTHE RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES BILL:THE IRON AND STEEL industry memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI think&apos; that my colleagues should be aware of the way in which it is proposed to handle a particular difficulty which has arisen as a result of the Cabinet&quot;s decision(CM.(56) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 11) that arrangements inthe iron and steel industry should not be excluded from thescope of the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill.2.      Under the Bill as it stands it is likely that thearrangements for the Industry Fund would be rogistrableand therefore subject in due course to scrutiny by the restrictive Practices Court.    The Industry Fund, broadly speaking, is the mechanism through which the equalisationof raw material costs within the industry is effected sothat uniform prices can be charged.    If it had to be dropped,or radically altered,  certain producing companies -especially those heavily dependent on imported raw materials -would find their costs correspondingly increased.3.      The Chairman of the Iron and Steel Realization Agencyinformed the Chancellor of the Exchequer that if matters were left on the basis that the.Industry Fund arrangements wereregistrable under the new legislation, the doubt about theircontinuance would be such as to make it impossible for the agency to dispose of their remaining shareholdings in the steel industry - especially in the important cases of the steel Company of Wales Ltd.  and Richard Thomas &amp; Baldwins Ltd.Both of these are companies which would be affected if these arrangements were discontinued.ho      It is of crucial importance that we should, not make a concession in the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill in favourof some arrangement in the steel industry which would giverise to embarrassing claims on behalf of other industries,especially those in respect of which there are Boards inexistence (the Cotton Board etc.) whose position could berepresented as analogous to, though not, of course, identical with, that of the Iron and Steel Board.    If we once had to admit such claims for exceptional treatment we should strike at the heart of the Bill.5.      Nevertheless, after consultation with the chancellor and the Agency I have thought it right to agree that in thevery special case of these Industry Fund arrangements, a straight exception from registration should be provided bymeans of an addition to clause 6 of the Bill.    The Chairmanof the Agency has confirmed that action on these lines willmeet satisfactorily the problem which he put to the Chancellor.S E C R E TCP. (56)  12616th May, 1956CABINET
6.      There ie an important presentational point.  to whichI would like to draw attention.    The amendment must he strictlyconfined to the Industry Fund arrangements.    If we were toattempt to carry it further we should at once find ourselves in difficulties vis-a-vis other industries.    As it is, I fear that we may have some difficulties of presentation in that wemay have to reveal that the amendment is being made simply toenable the shares to be sold.    Moreover, if I am pressed Ishall have to make it clear that although, if the amendment -is accepted, the Industry Fund arrangements will not beregistrable under the new legislation they will remain subject to scrutiny by the Monopolies Commission,,    In viewof these difficulties of presentation and the risk ofembarrassing claims on the grounds of precedent I think it essential that the proposed amendment should be tabled at alate stage during the passage of the Bill - i.e., during its passage through the House of Lords.P. T.Board of Trade,  S.W.1.16th May, 1956.
