(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT;jSECRETC,PC(56) 10830th April, 1956CABINETPARLIAMENT:  REMUNERATION OF MEMBERSNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Lord President, the Lord Privy Seal, the Chief Whip and Ihave had a preliminary discussion on members&apos; pay, expenses for peers and salaries for Ministers.     I attach for ease of reference a memorandum which I sent round to my colleagues for the purpose of that discussion.2,      We considered what the reactions to some such plan as is outlined in the memorandum might be, both in Parliament and in the Party.    we also considered the problem of timing, and the possibility of taking some minor measures in the near future, deferring the full plan until a later date.    We v/ould like to report orally to the Cabinet.H.M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.30th April, 1956.MEMBERS&apos; PAYPEERS8 EXPENSESMINISTERS&apos; salaries memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer am circulating this memorandum to the Lord President, theLord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip, purely as a basis for the discussion which I think the Cabinet would wish us to have among ourselves, tosee whether we are agreed on any specific proposals we could put to theCabinet.2.      In present circumstances I am not prepared to recommend any increase in the  5, 000 salary of a senior Minister.    I think, however, itis widely felt that the time has come when all Ministers in the House of copy NO. l jI-1-
Commons should receive, q\iite apart from their Ministerial salary, theParliamentary emoluments of an ordinary Member of Parliament, seeing that they have just the same constituency and Parliamentary expensesas their backbench colleagues,3.      The present rate of Members1 pay is  1, 000 a year, plus asessional allowance amounting to about  ZOO, minus a compulsorycontribution of  12 (which rather anomalously does not rank for incometax relief) to the Members&apos; Fund.4.      I understand that there is a feeling that the sessional allowance should be abolished and the pay raised from  1, 000 to  1, 500 a year.This is a proposition which I would not wish to oppose on purely financial grounds if the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip advise that it seemedto be politically the right thing to do.    I must reserve judgment on itmeanwhile,5.      If my Budget proposals on the taxation treatment of pensioncontributions for the self-employed become law, they may well take much,though not all, of the steam out of the demand for a contributory Members1pension scheme.    Under them, each Member will henceforth be able tomake his own pension arrangements to suit his individual needs, and getthe benefit of tax relief, which has hitherto not been available to him in his capacity as a self-employed person.6a      My judgment is that if there is not to be a contributory pension scheme for Members, it would be well to double the resources of theMembers1 Fund by raising the compulsory contribution from  12 to  24a year.    I also think that the contribution should rank for tax relief.Both these changes would require legislation, but it should not be controversial.7.      The Lord President advises me that provision needs to be madefor Peers&apos; expenses.    In my view this can only be done by the method ofauthorising a Peer who is not a Minister to claim expenses up to so much(say  3) for each day of attendance.     There is a serious practical difficulty in the way of making this a flat  3, not dependent on an expensesclaim.     If it were done in that way, the whole of the  3 automaticallybecomes taxable, and I do not think we could legislate to give a special and exclusive tax exemption in favour of Peers alone,8.      Now I come to Ministers&apos; salaries.     I had hoped there might bea solution for this difficult problem along the lines of leaving the ministerial salary unchanged but enabling all Ministers in the commons to receive in addition the Parliamentary emoluments of a Member ofParliament.    But this breaks down at once, because it would leave junior ministers in the Lords as badly underpaid ( 1, 500 a year) as they are atpresent.9.      We have to solve a dual problem.    We need to find a way of ensuring an adequate salary for junior Ministers in the Lords (if we do that we shall automatically be looking after junior Ministers in the commons, through the addition of their Parliamentary emoluments).   W ealso have to devise scales which will do justice to junior Ministers withoutpushing the pay of Ministers of State right up against the unchanged pay( 5, 000) of Cabinet Ministers, despite the vast difference in responsibility.
10o ,  Here is the best plan I have been able to work out to meet thesetwo difficulties, adopting the assumptions that the Parliamentaryemoluments will become  1, 500 a year, and that a junior Minister in the lords should not have less than  3, 000 a year: both those assumptionsmay be called in question.PLAN XGross EmolumentsPresentNew-Senior MinisterMinister of State(Commons(Lords(Commons(LordsFinancial Secretary, Treasury^and Economic Secretary, (CommonsTreasury (Parliamentary Secretary ( Commons(LordsWhip(Com mons(Lords5, 0005, 0003, 5003, 0002, 5002, 0001, 5001, 5001, 0006, 5005, 0005, 0003, 5005, 0004, 5003, 0003, 5002, 000It is of course essential to bear in mind, whatever scale we ultimatelydecide upon, that no Minister can claim tax relief in respect of his livingexpenses in London (as an ordinary Member of Parliament can);   and thata Minister in the Commons, unlike a Minister in the Lords, has to meetexpenses as a Member of Parliament, which may be anything from  500to  1, 000 (or more).11.     Plan X is open to criticism on more than one ground.    It may be criticised, as giving Parliamentary Secretaries in the Commons too much( 4, 500, less expenses) in comparison with Cabinet Ministers and Minister,of State.    But that follows directly from the necessity to give their counter-parts in the Lords enough ( 3, 000).     Plan X can also be criticised forgiving the Financial Secretary, Treasury and Economic Secretary,  Treasuras much as a Minister of State in the Commons ( 5, 000, less expenses) andmore than a Minister of State in the Lords ( 3, 500).    But, try as we may,we at the Treasury have so far found no means of producing a scale whichwill satisfy the various requirements and yet not produce some anomalies.There is a fundamental difficulty in maintaining differentials if junior ministers are to be properly paid while leaving senior Ministers&apos; salariesunchanged.12.     If it is considered that  2, 500 a year for a junior Minister in the lords is sufficient, the anomalies in Plan X can be mitigated.     Plan Y isbased on this alternative assumption.

If Plan Y is unacceptable on the ground that  2, 500 for a juniorMinister in the Lords is too little, a somewhat doubtful device for removing the weaknesses in Plan X has been suggested which I will include in this paper;  but I am bound to say that I should find it hard toproduce a logical defence for it.    It is based on the idea of overcoming the difficulty of the junior Ministers in the Lords by making a specialpayment of (say)  500 to all Ministers in the Lords because they arePeers, similar to the payment of  1, 500 to Ministers in the Commonsfor their Parliamentary expenses.    I agree that this would greatly help towards removing anomalies from the scale, but I can hardly see on whatgrounds a special payment of this sort to Ministers in the Lords couldbe justified.    Plan Z, however, is worked out on this basis.PLAN ZGross EmolumentsPresentNewSenior MinisterMinister of StateFinancial Secretary,Treasury and economic secretary, TreasuryParliamentary SecretaryWhip(Commons(Lords(Commons(Lords5, 0005, 0003, 5003, 000((Commons 2, 500((Commons 2, 000(Lords 1, 500(Commons 1, 500(Lords 1, 000 6, 5005, 5005, 0004, 0004, 5004, 0003, 0003, 0002, 000
14.    It will be convenient if I set out these three plans in one table.Plan Z, while it may be thought to produce the best figures, is based ona device which I do not think could be defended.Gross Emoluments		Present						 		 	 	 Senior Minister	(Commons (Lords	5, 000 5, 000	6, 5,	500 000	6, 500 5, 000	6, 500 5, 500Minister of State	(Commons (Lords	3, 500 3, 000	5, 3,	000 500	5, 000 3, 500	5, 000 4, 000Financial Secretary, ( Treasury and .   -               /Commons Economic Secretary^ Treasury                   (		2, 500	5,	000	4, 500	4, 500Parliamentary Secretary	(Commons (Lords	2, 000 1, 500	4, 3,	500 000	4, 000 2, 500	4, 000 3, 000Whip	(Commons (Lords	1, 500 1, 000	3, 2,	500 000	3, 000 1, 500	3, 000 2, 000H.M.April, 1956
