Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1956SECRET  ; - - . . Copy No.   48CP. (56) 11510th May, 1956CABINETNATIONAL INSURANCE BENEFIT RATESMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National insurance am circulating this paper for the information of my colleagues and am notat present asking approval for any action. I think, however, that my colleagues may care to bear the contents of this paper in mind in considering action in otherspheres which may have repercussive effects on the rates of National insurance benefits.2. The rates of National Insurance benefit (pensions, unemployment and sickness benefits) were last increased in the spring of 1955. The new rates for pensions actually came into effect on 25th April, 1955, and on 19th May for sickness, unemployment and industrial injury benefits. These rates then provided a sufficient margin for us to be able to say that their purchasing power was greaterthan or equal to what it had been at any time previously. It was also possibleto say, on the assumption that the Index of Retail Prices was a reliable guide, thatthe real value of the retirement pension, and the other benefits, was greater thanthe value of the original 26s. rate of pension introduced in 1946.3. Since the publication of the Retail Prices Index figure for March this is nolonger true. Again basing myself on the Index of Retail Prices the present standardbenefit rate of 40^. for a single person would require to be increased to 40\s\ 5d. to restore the purchasing power of the original 1946 pension.4. Particulars of the present main rates of benefit and of those ruling untillast year&apos;s changes are attached as an Appendix to this paper.5. Criticism of the level of the present rates, particularly for retirement pensions, is steadily developing. Agitation by the various pensioner pressuregroups continues vigorously and there is a steady flow of Parliamentary Questionsfrom the Opposition. In the last few weeks the Scottish Trade Union Council have carried a Resolution urging an increase of some 50 per cent, in rates of retirement pension and a Resolution calling for a substantial increase has been adopted bythe Convention of Royal Burghs.6. My assessment of the situation is that these pressures can be held for thetime being provided that prices remain relatively stable. There are, however, anumber of developments in the next few months which, if not offset by other factors, look like producing further rises in prices. These include the reduction inthe milk subsidy in July, the abolition of the bread subsidy in September and theincrease in the tobacco duty, an increase which is to apply fully to retirement pensioners. In addition, the future of the tobacco concession itself is underdiscussion, and developments in connection with rents might have a further adverse effect on prices.7. The key to the position is the retirement pension with its associatedunemployment and sickness benefit rates. Any alteration in it which may in due course become inevitable would probably require to be accompanied, as in thepast, by increases in war pension and industrial injury rates.49903
8. Although at present national assistance rates, unlike National Insurancerates, give a certain margin over their original values, they Would clearly be affectedeither by substantial changes in prices or a change in National Insurance rates.The adequacy of the national assistance scales cannot be measured by simpleo i reference to the movement of the Retail Prices Index. But the Index can give a&apos; rough guide to the whereabouts of the danger point. The last known Index figurewhen the Board proposed increasing the scale rate to 31s. 6d. was 144 (October1954); the last known figure when the increase to 40s. was proposed was 15/1/6(October 1955). The present figure on the old index is 155 and if it increased by asmuch again, that is to approaching 159, I think we should certainly receive aproposal from the Board for an increase in the assistance scales and might well doso before.9. Throughout this paper I have dealt with the issue on the basis ofcomparisons with the original rates. In the past the defence against making anincrease has largely rested on these lines, taken in conjunction with the Index of retail Prices. Two factors may in the future weaken these defences. The first is that the publication in the autumn of the material relating to pensioner budgetswill much weaken arguments based on the new Index of Retail Prices whichexpressly excludes such material. The second is that a school of thought is developing which is not content with a mere defence of the standards of 1946.This school of thought takes into account the substantial increases in the standards of a large section of the population since 1946 and is not content that retirement pensioners should be wholly excluded from a share in that improvement.J.
