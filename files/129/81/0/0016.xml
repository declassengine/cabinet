Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1956SECRET Copy No.CP. (56) 1169th May, 1956CABINETREFORM OF THE HOUSE OF LORDSMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilIn November, 1955, a meeting of Ministers was held, under the PrimeMinisters chairmanship, to discuss Reform of the House of Lords.2. That Meeting asked that a further examination should be made of thisquestion, with a view to the possible introduction, at an early date, of legislation on the subject. The task was entrusted to me. It seemed best to conduct the examination by stages, so as to ensure that any plan that might be adopted shouldbe such as would be likely to receive the widest measure of support.3. As a first step, I called into consultation my Cabinet colleagues, the LordChancellor, the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, the thenChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Lord Woolton, who had the additionaladvantage of being also Chairman of the Conservative Party, and also the chief whip, Lord Fortescue. We first considered whether it would be desirable to go into action again on the scheme discussed with the Labour and Liberal Parties atthe abortive talks in 1948, on which a substantial measure of agreement was widelythought to have been reached. But we discarded this idea, for a number of reasons.For one thing, the measure of agreement reached at the 1948 talks seemed to thoseof us who had taken part in them to be more apparent than real. Moreover, defectsin the plan, which had not been noticed in 1948, had since become visible. under it, membership of the reformed House was to be based, so far as the hereditaryelement was concerned, on a dual qualification. A peer had to have a hereditarytitle, and he had also to be a Privy Councillor. No one would, I imagine, suggestthat such a test was not adequate. The difficulty that has emerged is that it was onthe contrary too exclusive. For it inevitably cut out nearly all the youngerhereditary peers, who are most unlikely to be Privy Councillors; and young back-bench members are as necessary to the House of Lords as to the House ofCommons, if the routine work of the House, e.g., on the Committee Stage of Bills,is to be properly done. Moreover, it took no acount of the geographic factor. Totake an extreme example, practically all the Privy Councillor Peers might live inthe Home Counties, in which case the rest of the United Kingdom would be largelyif not entirely unrepresented: and, in any event, there would be likely to be widegaps.   We therefore discarded the 1948 plan, and turned to possible alternatives.4. It would, of course, be possible to produce innumerable schemes, all ofwhich would have attractions. But most of them must, in our view, be ruled outon grounds of their complexity. It will be hard enough to get agreement on a simple plan: complicated schemes, with representatives from this, that and theother sphere of our national life, would, we are sure, only arouse the maximum of controversy, even among supporters of reform, and render agreement virtually impossible. We therefore came to the conclusion that we must decide on certainbroad principles, and within those principles try to devise the simplest structure wecould.49897b
70ft5,These principles on which we agreed were as follows:  The House should contain -(1): x. Hereditary peers.(2) x Non-hereditary peers.(3) x Spiritual peers (as at present?).  .,  .(4)    The Law Lords as at present.(5)    Women should be eligible for membership.6. Basing ourselves on these principles, we evolved the following draftplan :.-7. (1) The House should consist of 400 members. 250 would be &quot;electedPeers of Parliament &quot; from the body of Hereditary Peers, and 150 would be&quot;Nominated Peers of Parliament.&quot;There was at first considerable difference of view as to the right numbers.But the view was held by more than one Minister that 300 would in any case be too small a House. Members of a Second Chamber nearly always tend to beelderly, and often also occupy important positions in other walks of life: so theycannot, in the nature of things, attend as often as Members of the House ofCommons. Allowance must be made for this fact, though, with improved financial provisions for members of the House and the increased prestige which reformmight be expected to give, the number of those prepared to attend might well go up.It was also felt that the hereditary peers would expect to represent rather a larger proportion of the House than the Life Peers. It should, however, be said thatsome of my colleagues, while agreeing with the total figure of 400, would prefer the numbers of hereditary and non-hereditary peers to be 200 and 200, on thegrounds that to include a larger number of hereditary peers, who are known tobe predominantly Conservative, would give an impression of packing the newHouse. I have personally no very strong views about this, and would merely saythat the proportion of 250:150 would undoubtedly be easier to get through theHouse of Lords, though I expect they could be got to accept the other. The house should include the Law Lords and an Episcopal Bench. The number of Bishopsshould be the same as at present. The question of whether there should berepresentation of other religious denominations was left over for furtherconsideration.The Royal Dukes should be automatically members of the House.(2) The powers of the House should remain unaltered. There was unanimous agreement about this.(3) An expense allowance of  x a day for each day on which they had attended the House should be made to peers. There should be no assiduity qualification,or tags of any other kind, attaching to this allowance. In addition, the existingrailway allowance to Peers to enable them to travel between their homes and parliament should be continued, also without an assiduity qualification.This particular proposal need not of course be introduced simultaneously withthe general scheme of reform. Indeed the view was strongly urged by some ministers that it should precede reform, on the ground that it would not be muchuse asking members of the House to undertake more onerous duties unless wefirst made it clear to them that it would be made financially possible for them to fulfil those duties. I think that there, is force in this view, and, while I fully acceptthe arguments against taking any step in the matter at the present juncture (CM.(56) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 6), should personally be glad to see expenseallowances for peers granted as soon as practicable. The present position is becoming quite indefensible. Moreover, as the Labour Party is likely to opposeany scheme for reform of the House of Lords and yet do not appear to be soviolently against some form of expense allowance for peers, there are strong arguments in favour of treating the one issue separately from the other.(A) Women should be admitted to membership of the reformed House,whether as Hereditary Peeresses in their own right, or as Life Peeresses. Therewere wide differences of opinion among my colleagues as to what was ideallydesirable about this, but there was unanimity in recognising that, in practice, theHouse of Lords could no longer hold out against the inclusion of women.Draft Plan of Reform
8. Elected Peers of Parliament (Hereditary Peers). All these proposals provedgenerally acceptable. But we ran into serious difficulties over the representationof the hereditary peerage in the Reformed House. No problem arose over theexisting Scottish Representative Peers, for no one wished to disturb the Act of union. The real issue was over the representation of the United Kingdom Peerage.We had devised a scheme which should, in effect, be an extension of the existing arrangements for Scottish Representative Peers, referred to above. At first, theprospects of such a plan proving practicable seemed pretty rosy. It was accepted,first, by members of the Cabinet in the House of Lords, and subsequently, by aMeeting, which I called, of all Members of the Front Bench in the Lords. but after a great deal of work had been done on it, we came up against a considerablebody of opposition from Back Bench peers, a powerful section of whom objectedstrongly to the elective principle altogether even when it involved only the election of peers by their fellow peers. This opposition might possibly have beensurmounted. But it emerged from discussions which some of us subsequently had with the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip in the House of Commons that thesame difficulty was likely to be met with there. The Commons, we were told,would be extremely critical of any attempt to introduce into any scheme of reforman elective element of so very restricted, and it might be argued, so very biased a character.Faced with the prospect of serious opposition in both Houses to any schemebased on the Scottish model, we have turned our minds to the possibility of findingsome alternative method of limiting the unwieldy mass of the hereditary peerage,and have now come down in favour of a scheme which should have that effect,without introducing the elective principle to which objection has been taken. Thisscheme has not yet been worked out in full detail; but the broad lines are quitesimple. They are that the House of Lords should set up a Standing Committeeof Selection, composed of say 30 members of all Parties, to select the 200 or250 hereditary peers who should form the hereditary element in the reformed house. To initiate the scheme, the existing House would be asked to approve alist of proposed members of the Committee. This would have been drawn up by consultation between the Parties through the usual channels. A letter would besent to all hereditary peers asking whether they wished to be considered forselection, and indicating a date by which replies must be sent in. All peers who did not reply by the designated date would be regarded as having answered in the negative. The Committee would then set to work, and produce its list of selectedpeers, to whom and to whom alone writs of summons would be sent for theremainder of that Parliament. Peers not on the list would no longer be able to sit in the House, though it is for consideration whether they should not, with their wives, continue to be eligible to attend the opening of Parliament, which could beregarded as a ceremonial assemblage of the whole peerage, rather than a sitting ofthe House.The Committee would remain in being throughout the Parliament, and would continue to function until after the ensuing general election and would select the hereditary element for the post-election House of Lords. It would then have completed its mandate, and the new House would itself approve the Committeewhich should operate during the new Parliament and until after the following general election, when the procedure would be repeated. If a member of theCommittee died or was obliged to retire from the Committee during a Parliament,the Leader of the House, after consultation with the Leaders of the other Parties,would recommend to the House the name of a peer to take his place. I would suggest that the membership of the Committee of Selection should not be confined to hereditary peers but should be open to suitable non-hereditary peers also.It will be seen that this scheme, if it proved acceptable to the two Houses ofParliament, should have some solid practical advantages over the earlier&quot; Scottish &quot; plan. Apart altogether from the fact that it would avoid the obnoxiouselective principle, it would ensure that those who decided the membership of thenew House would all be men well qualified for this duty. There would be nobackwoodsmen on the Committee of Selection. They would all be men highlyrespected in the House itself and with personal knowledge of what was required.It is true that the difficulty of assessing the merits of younger peers, who had askedto be considered for membership of the new House but who had had no opportunityof showing their qualities, would still remain. But it should be far easier for acommittee, in close touch with peers from all parts of the country, to inform49897 b 2
themselves about these young peers than for the whole body of the hereditarypeerage, scattered throughout the country.It should also have the advantage that an all-Party select committee wouldgive more weight to the personal attributes of candidates than to their Partyaffiliations. This, in a Second Chamber that has, to some extent at any rate, thecharacter of a Council of State, is clearly desirable. In particular, it should give more chance of the selection of crossbenchers, who are affiliated to no Party but -including, as they do, most of the great retired civil servants, ambassadors, and service chiefs are coming to play a more and more important part in the House.Such is the plan for the representation of United Kingdom hereditary peersthat I now recommend to my colleagues in the Cabinet.9. Non-Hereditary or &quot; Nominated&quot; Peers of Parliament. There wasunanimous agreement that the reformed House should include non-hereditaryLords of Parliament. Such nominated members could be called Lords, Senators,or they could put L.P. after their name. I favour the first alternative. The lesschanges we make, the easier it will be to get the scheme through the House ofLords. There was some difference of view among my colleagues as to whetherthey should be nominated for life or for some shorter period. There was a slightpreference for life, with power for a peer to retire, if he wished. The question was left open whether, in such an event, he should retain his title out of courtesy.My proposal is that Nominated Peers of Parliament should be appointed by her Majesty on the advice of the Prime Minister. They would hold their peeragesfor life.   There would, however, be power of retirement.It was proposed that, initially, in order to get the scheme for nominated peersstarted:  Immediately after the passing of the Act, a number of nominated peers,say, 50 or 75, should be chosen in proportion to the total numbers of voteseast for the main political Parties, Conservative, Liberal and Labour, at thepreceding general election.The Leaders of the main Opposition Parties should hand in their lists tothe Prime Minister, who should recommend them to The Queen.After that, 10 peers should be appointed each year, either on the same basis as the first batch or alternatively by the Prime Minister of the daywithout consultation with the other Parties, until, the full number had beencompleted. From then on, vacancies from death or retirement would be filled by The Queen, on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of the day. &apos;I and the other colleagues in the House of Lords whom I have consultedhave given a great deal of thought to the difficult question as to whetherit would be right to preserve to the Government of the day the power to swampthe House of Lords, in the event of a conflict between the two Houses. If thatwas considered desirable, it could be done by saying that the number ofnominated peers should normally remain at 150 or 200, but that the PrimeMinister of the day should have a reserve power to ask The Queen to createmore nominated peers in the event of a crisis between the two Houses ofParliament. Our considered view has been that such reserve powers are nolonger necessary or indeed desirable, now that the suspensory veto has beenreduced to one year. To go further would be to make the veto a farce.On a balance of considerations, therefore, we have come to the conclusionthat provision for swamping should not form part of the scheme.10.   The following other points of agreement should be mentioned.(a) The Episcopal Bench and the Law Lords should be in addition to thestatutory number of nominated peers.(b) Law Lords should be life peers, appointed for life or till they retired.(There are, and would continue to be, a very small number of hereditary peers who hold or have held high judicial office as defined&apos; by s. 25 of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, 1876, e.g., ex-LordsChancellor, Lords Chief Justice and Masters of the Rolls. These would automatically be members of the House, in view of the legal duties^ which they are in a position to perform in the House.)(c) The Lord Chancellor could be either a hereditary or a life peer.(d) Hereditary peers, as explained earlier, would hold for the duration of oneParliament, after which they could, if they wished, stand for re-election.
(e) The Irish representative Peers (there are four of them left who have not also got United Kingdom Peerages) should have the right to sit and vote in the House, but would not vote at elections under paragraph 8above. This right would not continue beyond the present holders ofthese peerages.11. It was suggested that hereditary peers, who had been Cabinet Ministers,might sit for life or until they wished to retire, and might not therefore be subjectto election: but no final agreement was reached on this point.12. Such are the broad lines of the scheme that I put forward for theconsideration of the Cabinet.I have tried it on members of the Government in the House of Lords and also,in strict confidence, on one or two highly respected back-bench Conservative peers,who carry considerable weight in the House; and their reaction has been uniformlyfavourable. Whether that will also be the opinion of the broad mass of theConservative Peerage, I do not know. I would propose to continue myexplorations. But I must first have the approval of my colleagues to the broadlines of the revised plan, especially as it concerns the hereditary peerage. It is forthat that I ask to-day.S.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,8th May, 1956.
