THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT -WKWM^mwM Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1956UM SECRET Copy No. 28WM (56) 15021st June, 1956CABINETANGLO-SOVIET RELATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsI ProblemAt a meeting of Ministers on 1st May, 1956, I was called upon to review mjm1 existing policy in respect of propaganda activities directed against the Communistsystem in all parts of the world, including the Overseas Services of the B.B.C., mmiI and to submit my recommendations for consideration by the Cabinet. I have inmAW particular considered whether any changes in our propaganda policy towards the mmSoviet Union and Satellites are desirable in order to improve Anglo-SovietmMW relations; and the nature of our propaganda towards &quot; uncommitted &quot; countries.mim Argument2. It is of course true only in the most general sense that our publicity ^Bw.mmM               agencies seek to &quot; undermine Communism in all parts of the world.&quot; This phraseoverstates the possibilities and may give a misleading idea of our actual operations.mmW We do not attack Communism itself in Soviet Russia: and even in the Satellitesand elsewhere our emphasis has always been on public enlightenment, by meansmm] of which we combine telling the world the truth about ourselves with explaining^^w\ how Communism operates. Essentially our idea is that if emotion is replaced by mmHI reason our case will in the long run win on its merits. An exposure of the aimsand methods of Communism, an analysis of its special jargon and sign language mmm is essential to that objective judgment which, in the last resort, is all we can appeal ^^flmmW to in countries whose right we recognise to manage their affairs. mmWmm\ The Present Nature of the Communist Threat3. Stalin is dead and discredited. The new Soviet leaders have relaxed his ^^flmAm                terror inside the Soviet Union and are releasing liberal forces which may prove mmhard to check. In particular the multiplication of technicians is creating a new mmmmM social class which is not so easily satisfied with official intellectual pabulum. These mml^h   changes are being reflected in the Satellites. Policy, and with it propaganda, have ^Rw.mMW become less aggressive and more elastic. The Soviet Union now has less to fear Ithan before from comparison and contacts with the West.   It takes credit formmW Soviet material and political achievements at an apparently diminishing cost in^^w\ human bondage and suffering.  The visit of the Soviet leaders to London has mmshown that they undoubtedly seek to relax the tension with the West created byStalin. Their aim is still, however, to see the world progressively communised. mmTheir analysis of the basic conflict between Communism and &quot; Capitalism &quot;remains the same. Their attacks on our policies continue, though they are couched mm^Rg\m in less violent language and the more fantastic charges have been dropped. TheirmmW attack on our position in the underdeveloped and Colonial territories has in fact mmincreased. They frankly admit that they intend to subvert our Colonies. TheirmMW main idea seems to be to neutralise the United Kingdom and Western Europe byWk making it more tempting to us to disarm morally as well as physically; and ^Bw.mAW meanwhile to drive forward in the uncommitted countries and the Colonies, wherethey reckon the going to be easier and more profitable.mm 50067
\mm\\ m\\\\^^fl 4. The active elements in present -Soviet policy, can be summarised as ^LwM^LwM            follows -(a) Towards the United Kingdom: ^LWMmmm\     L     ^  ^ increased trade offers;                                              .    f ^Lmm^LwM                  (ii) more amicable official relations;                                   &apos;jfe.,&quot;&apos;  -fyj ^Lm%(iii) increased public contacts, controlled, however, as far as p&apos;og^bl^jp their ^LwMown interest (a Soviet proposal for relaxing radio jamming only for a ^LWM^LwM                          short defined period each day is typical); ^LwM(iv) economic injury through Communist activity in trade unions, &amp;c.: mk(b) Towards Our Allies: m^Lwl^LwM                 Encouragement of neutralism: ^L^Lm^L^m             (c) In the Colonies ^LWMEncouragement of &quot; liberation&quot; movements and anti-Westernsentiments by all possible means.  There is ample evidence that plansare far advanced for increasing this activity: ^LWM(d) In the &quot; Uncommitted&quot; Countries:(i) portrayal of the West as the enemy and the Soviet bloc as the friend; ^LWM(ii) comparison of the current achievements of the Soviet bloc and of the ^L^L\Western democracies;(iii) establishment of an economic basis for political penetration. ^LWMImmediate Conclusions to be Drawn ^L^LM5.  The new Soviet policy raises serious problems for us, but also offers new ^L^LM^LWM            opportunities.  The Soviet leaders may think that they have the Soviet public ^LwMw^LWM            sufficiently behind the regime now to ignore the effect of increased news and freer w^-m^LWM contacts on their own people.   The Satellites are clearly less under control.Equally, now that the bear has come out of his forest, we can encourage and exploit ^L^LM^LWM any disillusionment which his conduct may create in the outside world.  It mustbe admitted that in recent months the Russian leaders have been remarkablysuccessful in popularising themselves and their policies in the outside world. They ^L^M^LWM            have dissipated much of the suspicion and fear aroused by Stalin, and Communist ^L^M^LWM propaganda has confused millions of people, in the uncommitted countries as wellas in the Soviet bloc, into believing that the Western Powers are the exploiters anddisturbers of the peace. ^LWMW^LWm                 6.  We should not be deterred from legitimate self-defence and legitimate -^Lw^LWM            criticism by fear of Soviet complaints that what we say or do is contrary to our ^L^LM^LWM            desire to improve Anglo-Soviet relations.  The Russians have made it clear, in ^L^L\^LWM            principle and in practice, that their corresponding desire will not inhibit them from ^^flattacking our philosophy or our policies. The Russians say: &quot; It is a matter of ^L^M^LWM            principle.&quot; We also can invoke our conscience.Our Response to the New Situation ^L^Lm7. In our propaganda to Russia the new situation, therefore, calls for minor faB ^LwM^LWM adjustments in tone, but not for major changes, Our publicity towards the ^LWM^LWm\ Satellites assumes even greater impor-tance than before, because the rulers are ^LWm^LWM uncertain of themselves and public opinion is on the move. A relaxation of our ^LwM^Lwmm effort towards the Satellites would out them off from a major means of contact WmW^LwM with the outside world, arouse despondency in the large anti-Communist elements ^LwM^Lwmm both in Eastern Europe and abroad and weaken the forces which, in the long run, ^-M^LWm\           will help to make Soviet policy less dangerous to us. There is no evidence that ^L^LMour propaganda towards the Satellites disturbs AnglOrSoviet relations. ^LWM8. Our propaganda effort towards &quot; uncommitted &quot; countries., particularly ^L^Lm^LWM those directly threatened by the Communists (e.g., in the Middle East) should be ^LwM^LWmM substantially stepped up. We should not stop at exposing, the Communists as ^LwM^^^1 the enemies of nationalism, but should continue to combine, our exposure with ^L^L\^Lwmm positive publicity for our own policies and in particular our friendship for genuine ( ^L^M^^^H nationalists in the uncommitted countries. In our Colonies, similarly, our efforts ^LwM^L^LWa           should be substantially increased. ^L^M
mum mmWKwM Propaganda Outlets and Targets WmWMWKwM 9.  Our main publicity tools are: -wKwM (a) B.B.C. broadcasts (almost the only direct means we have of influencing ^kwrnWEwM opinion behind the Iron Curtain); WmwM^Lmi (b). the information network of Her  Majesty&apos;s  Missions  and officialm^m representatives abroad; mwMwMm (c) the United Kingdom press and British agencies abroad; ^kW^WkvM (d) influential persons in the confidence of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, to wewm^MM i k whom we can supply information on demand.wMm Recommendations: wAwM^kwM (a) Soviet Union UEwM^Lm* The general line of our propaganda and publicity towards Russia ^kwMshould remain unchanged, particular attention being given, however, mmWEvM to encouraging Russian interest in and knowledge of the outside world. ^kwMmml We should give emphasis to news of current events; to painting an wAwMaccurate and objective picture of life in the United Kingdom; to ^kwMMKwM removing known and frequently advertised Russian misconceptions ^LwMWKvM of it; to indicating the benefits, moral and intellectual as well as ^kwM^mwM physical, of the Western world&apos;s way of conducting its affairs.   The m^m\&quot;Late Programme&quot; (23.15 and 00.15 G.M.T.) of the B.B.C. Russian MmwMm Service, introduced in 1952 with the aim of encouraging defections ^mwMwMm from the Soviet armed forces, should, however, be discontinued.   It WAwM^kwM has not been successful; and it is a potential irritant. WmwMWmwM %   (b) Satellites ^kwMWKWM The general line of our publicity to the Satellites should remain ^LwMwKwM unchanged.  The B.B.C. should be encouraged in their present trend WAwM^kwM towards constructive and forward-looking comment upon internal ^kwM^kwM developments. ^kwMWmwM (c) Uncommitted Countries ^kwMWKwM Our efforts in the uncommitted countries should be substantially ^mWM^kwM increased. We should continue to enlighten them about Communists&apos; ^mwM^kwM aims and methods, including their use of nationalism to further their ^kwM^kwM own ends, but should also stress our friendship for all genuine ^kwMUAwM ?               nationalist aspirations.(d) Colonies^LwM The growing Communist challenge should be met by promoting^kwM a general awareness of the danger. More use might be made of I.R.D.wKwM 11               and similar publications.mm I                                                         s&apos;&apos; w umm^m^mV,*m Foreign Office, S.W.I,H 1            20th June,
