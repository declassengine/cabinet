SECRET  Copy No. O c.p.. (46) 35223fi September, 1946CABINETPENSIONS AND ALLOWANCES OF PERSONS OF COLONIALORIGIN ENLISTED IN egypt memorandum BY THE PARLIAMENTARY  UNDER-SECRETARY  OFSTATE  FOR WARI circulate for the information of my colleagues, when considering the memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (46) 349), the following note.N. of C.The War Office,23rd September, 1946.NOTEDuring the war personnel have been recruited for the Army all over the world;for the various categories raised abroad differing pay, allowances and disability, etc.,pension codes are in existence designed to suit the local circumstances of their place of origin. In some cases, the pension code is unrelated to the British code [e.g., in Ceylonit is related to those fixed by the local Government); in others, the pension terms area proportion of British rates. For the colonies, etc., of the Eastern Mediterranean,Malta, Cyprus, Palestine, the pension terms have been fixed at two-thirds of Britishrates, and the same basis has been adopted for Egypt. The reason for the adoption 01the two-thirds basis for local enlistments in Egypt was that most of the personnel con-cerned were of Maltese or Cypriot origin, and were comparable with those enlisted inMaltese or Cypriot contingents. As, however, some of the personnel concerned werenot of this category, a special arrangement was made in the case of Egypt under whichin suitable cases, higher rates (not to exceed full British rates) could be given atdiscretion.On the question whether it would be possible to allow full British pension rates forall enlistments in Egypt without the danger of repercussions on the rates in force forenlistments elsewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean, the War Office view is that it wouldbe difficult to avoid comparisons being drawn between the Egypt enlistments and thoseof their compatriots enlisted in the Eastern Mediterranean colonies, etc., were the formerallowed higher pension rates than the latter. The fact that certain of the Egypt enlist-ments were compulsory is not a justification for preferential pension terms. Thevolunteer would certainly not agree that the conscript should enjoy better terms onthe ground that he was compulsorily enlisted.It is not, I think, in dispute that there is a difference between the living circum-stances of the Maltese, Cypriot, etc., communities in Egypt, and that of the &quot; Anglo-Saxons &quot;, and the present arrangement under which &quot; Anglo-Saxons &quot; can get fullBritish rates does not raise the issue of racial discrimination within the Commonwealthbut is related to differences in standards of living.When arranging for discretionary awards at full British pension rates in suitable cases, the War Office had sought to avoid the implication that a racial distinction was involved. The distinction was between the normal case awarded at the two-thirds ratesand the exceptional case for which a higher rate might be justified, although it is truethat the exceptional case would be that of a person domiciled in the British Isles whohappened to be living in Egypt at the time of his joining the Forces. The discretionarypower to award at full British rates was introduced in the case of Egypt primarilybecause it was considered that some of the enlistments in Egypt might be of personsonly temporarily resident there whose domicile and associations were outside Egypt,in the British Isles or elsewhere, and it was felt that some special provision would benecessary in such cases.This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty^ GovernmentPrinted for the Cabinet, September, 1946
2I would point out that the differentiation of rates does not apply to Egypt alone.For instance, in the pension field alone (which is, of course, quite a minor matter) thereare in East Africa, administered by the Colonies concerned, separate codes forEuropeans, Asiatics, and natives, and in West Africa separate codes for Europeans andfor natives. As another example, the pension terms for Basutos, etc., enlisted into theBritish Army are as for coloured men of the forces of the Union of South Africa, ofwhich Basutoland is an enclave, and which Dominion has, of course, laws involvingracial discrimination in various directions.Information is not immediately available as to the cost of the pensions at presentin payment in respect of enlistments in Egypt, but the total cost of pension awards bythe War Office in respect of local enlistments in Malta and the Middle East, includingEgypt, is at present about ^100,000 a year. But it is not only pensions which are calculated at less than British rates. Under present regulations troops raised locallyabroad receive full British rates of pay only when serving overseas and less than fullBritish rates when serving in their own countries. If they are now to receive full rates ofBritish pension it will be difficult to resist a claim that they should receive full Britishrates of pay when serving in their own countries. The cost of such a change cannotbe estimated.It should be observed that locally engaged civilians are paid local rates and not theBritish rate for corresponding duties.0(B46/13)   no   9/46   W.O.P.   26495/
