THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1946.SECRET. Copy No. CP. (46) 399.24*A October, 1946.CABINET.UNITED  KINGDOM  BREAD   SUPPLIES.Memorandum by the Minister of Food.AS my colleagues are aware, I have been most anxious to relieve the british public, and the trades affected, of the burden of bread rationing before the onsetof winter. I have publicly stated on several occasions that it was the Govern-ments intention to de-ration immediately the supply position warranted sucha course. The primary purpose of the scheme as announced was to get us through a difficult but limited period with safety, and the presumption was that at theend of that period bread rationing would come to an end.2. It has been suggested that we should retain bread rationing in this country on the ethical ground that we ought not to permit virtually unlimited consump-tion in the United Kingdom while the world in general, and India in particular,continues to be short of cereals. I could not accept this view, and were thesupply position such as to enable us with reasonable safety to de-ration bread and to meet the bare minimum requirements of areas of direct British respon-sibility, I should press very strongly for this course to be adopted in the belief that my colleagues would give me their support.3. Unfortunately the supply situation is developing in a way far less favour-able than seemed probable even a few weeks ago. While no final assessment of the world position has yet been made by the Cereals Committee of the I.E.F.C.,provisional estimates indicate that there will again be a net world cereal deficit in 1946-47 of several million tons. As regards our own position, last year onthe 13th October, 1945, our stock of wheat and flour was 1,838,000 tons (wheat equivalent); it now amounts to only 1,034,000 tons (wheat equivalent). In the short run the main adverse factor in our own position is the failure of the canadians to keep up their promised rate of shipment this autumn, and theirgrowing failure to build up adequate stocks on the Atlantic Coast before thefreeze-up of the Great Lakes. Again, the United States strike has delayed the shipment of the balance of the supplies due to us under the Lord Presidentsarrangement of last summer. Lastly, our own harvest has been both late and!small. These factors mean that instead of being able to build up adequate stocksagainst any further interruption of supplies during the winter, we are stillstruggling along with some 9 weeks&apos; stock in hand, well below the 11 weekswhich we regard as the prudent minimum.4. In the longer terms the prospect for next summer is unassured. In this case it is not a question of interruptions of supply but simply that we are notyet clear that we shall be able to buy the wheat we need. I have so far been unable to get an assurance from the Canadian Government that they will sellus any additional supplies when we have had the 4,324,000 tons under the con-tract. The prospect of supplies from the United States and the Argentine is dealt with below. The only other source of supply is Australia, and we haveearmarked the whole balance of the Australian crop (after India has had hershare) to our Far Eastern Colonies for whose supply we are responsible. Indeed,the table at Appendix II shows that we have enough wheat in sight (5,387,000tons) to satisfy our own needs if it were not for this dreadful burden of having to supply another 1,834,000 tons to these Colonial areas.5.   In this deteriorating situation it would seem impossible to recommendde-rationing for the moment.   In fact unless something is done to alter thepresent prospect the appalling disasters of either (i) a failure to supply our[32599] B
Colonies or (ii) an actual cut in our own bread ration, will face us. It will Ithink be apparent to my colleagues when they study the appendices and tablesattached to this note that any diversions of our existing supplies to germany or India are literally out of the question to-day. At any rate they could onlybe undertaken if we were prepared to face an immediate cut in our bread ration.The object of this paper is not merely, however, to call attention to this rapidlydeteriorating situation, but to propose measures for remedying it.6. I have set out in the appendices the latest assessment of the; supply position and the statistical position on the basis of that assessment. It willbe seen that even on the more optimistic assumption (Basis B in Appendix lit)we must secure an additional 407,000 tons of wheat and flour (wheat equivalent)to enable us to maintain the present level of bread/flour rations (93,800 tonsa week flour off take) throughout the period to September 1947. The additional quantity over and above Basis B supplies which we should need to de-rationnow and consequently sustain a weekly flour off take of 100,000 tons would beabout 836,000 tons.7. The above figures assume what are termed &quot; Prudent Minimum Stocks,&quot;i.e., 11 weeks&apos; supply in terms of flour. It is true that we can manage withappreciably lower stocks than this without a break-down in distribution. Infact we have at the moment only 9 weeks&apos; supply, and at our low point on the24th August last had only 8-6 weeks&apos; supply. But it is only too probable thatduring the remainder^ of the crop year there will be uncontrollable interruptionsCanadian failure to establish adequate stocks on the Atlantic coast before thefreeze up of the Great Lakes. In these circumstances it would be a bold man who suggested that it would be all right to base our calculations upon less than an 11 weeks&apos; stock.8. For the reasons given in Appendix I, the only source to which we canturn for these additional supplies is the United States and I consider that anearly high level approach to the United States Government should be madefor the release of sufficient wheat to enable this country to de-ration bread, or,failing that, for wheat sufficient at least to assure the maintenance of the presentation level throughout the period to the 30th September, 1947.9. The 836,000 tons we need from United States to de-ration is out of atotal United States cereals export of some 12 million tons. So the request is acomparatively modest one in terms of supply. But I should warn my colleagues that it will not be an easy matter to persuade the United States Government tomake these supplies available and that in so far as we are successful it will inevitably be at the expense of other countries, since there is not enough breadgrain available for export to satisfy all needs. The Americans will no doubtpoint out in response to our approach that the whole of the Australian wheat and flour, and most of the Canadian wheat export surpluses have already beenfully mortgaged for the United Kingdom and British Empire countries, andthat if we are successful in securing the 500,000 tons from the Argentine forwhich we have allowed in Basis B, we shall leave little Argentine wheat for otherclaimants, since under the Argentine/Brazil wheat agreement the latter may take 45 per cent, of the exportable surplus.10. I should perhaps draw attention to the fact that we are giving priority over United Kingdom requirements to those areas which have hitherto been treatedas a direct British responsibility (see paragraph 17, Appendix I) and that ifwe were to disregard our obligations and divert to the United Kingdom thesupplies at present earmarked for them we should have more than sufficient wheat and flour to restore flour consumption in the United Kingdom to the level prevail-ing before the introduction of bread rationing. But their import requirements have been assessed to give no more than minimum subsistence, and any significant reduction in supplies would bring the peoples of these countries to starvationpoint, with serious political and economic repercussions.11. A similar position exists in regard to India. In this review it has been assumed that the balance of the wheat which Australia can make available forexport next year after supplies for the above Colonial areas -will be sent toIndia. The amount involved is about 850,000 tons, and the diversion of this wheat to the United Kingdom would enable us to restore flour consumption in thiscountry almost to the p re-rationing level. The Australians would welcome theopportunity of selling wheat again for United Kingdom consumption; theyof supply such as the presentUnited States and the
agreed to the diversion of their exportable surplus to India only because theywere assured that this course was in the best interests of the Empire as a whole.12. With the exception, therefore, of the balance of the Canadian flourexport surplus, which may not exceed 600,000 tons, and the coarse grain whichmay be available in South America amounting perhaps to 2 million tons, thereis no substantial quantity of bread grain or flour, outside the United States,available to importing countries other than the United Kingdom and the Empire.The effect of this is to throw practically the whole of the world cereals deficit on to the United States and the Americans will again feel that they are being forced to incur the odium of starving the world of wheat. They may be expectedto react strongly against this, and to contend that, since the United kingdom has assured the Empire position by taking the Australian and Canadian supplies,other claimants must be given a higher priority than the United Kingdom for united States supplies.13. Apart altogether from these political considerations, the grain exportcapacity of the United States is unlikely to exceecl 9 million tons during theremainder of the year to the 30th June, 1947, and about 1 million tons a monththereafter, and there will be many deserving claimants apart from ourselves forthese supplies. Of the total United States export availability of approximately12 million tons to the 30th September, 1947, there is needed, after making allow-ance for the possibility of coarse grain supplies from elsewhere, a net requirement of approximately:  Tons.For the United Kingdom and areas of directBritish responsibility...      ...       ...       ... 836,000For the three Western Zones of Germany (say)... 3,000,000For India (say)       .................        750,0004,500,000(approximately)If these supplies were made available by the United States there would be left for all other claimants only about 1\ million tons.Recommendation.14.   I accordingly recommend that (i) Bread rationing be continued for the present. If all the measures setout below were to fail we might have to face a decision either to cutsupplies to our colonies or to cut our own ration. But that gravesituation can still be averted,(ii) No diversions to Germany, India or elsewhere can be contemplated while our own position, is as precarious as it is to-day. I do not under -estimate for a moment the extreme gravity of the German and Indianpositions. But these problems can and must be met by urgent consulta-tions with the United States Government, not by futile attempts tofeed the hundreds of millions of people out of resources which aregravely inadequate even for ourselves. If we try that again this year,we shall ruin ourselves and not save the Germans or the Indians.(iii) The Canadian Government be asked to institute a vigorous campaignwith the object of persuading wheat producers to market during the crop year a larger quantity of wheat than it is their present intentionto sell. This would have no significant effect upon the United Kingdomposition during the closed navigation period, but should increasesupplies from June 1947 onwards.(iv) An early high-level approach be made to the United States Governmentfor their agreement to the sale to the United Kingdom of 836,000 tonsof wheat, the quantity needed for arrival to relieve this country ofthe burden of bread rationing to the 30th September, 1947.(v) In the meantime, the present bread rationing scheme be simplified and enforced more rigorously in order that, if our approach to the UnitedStates Government is not wholly successful, we are fully prepared tomeet the situation.J.

APPENDIX I.Assessment of United Kingdom Cereals Supply Prospects.Requirements.1. The tables in Appendix II set out the approximate wheat/flour ship-ment requirements for the year from the 1st October, 1946, to the 30th September,1947, of the United Kingdom and of certain areas for the supply of which theUnited Kingdom has direct responsibility and the quantities so far assuredagainst these requirements. Briefly, 995,000 tons are required, in addition tothe quantities already in sight or assumed to be available, in order to maintainat a relatively low level of subsistence the Colonies and territories for which theUnited Kingdom is responsible and to restore consumption in the United kingdom to a level consistent with a weekly flour off take of 100,000 tons.Estimated Stock Position on Various Assumptions.2. Appendix III sets out the United Kingdom stool? position on the basisof certain common assumptions in regard to, e.g., consumption and the flourextraction rate, and two alternative assumptions in regard to forthcoming-supplies.3. For the purpose of reviewing the forward position, it is necessary toconsider (i) the period to the 31st May, 1947, and (ii) the period from the1st June to the 30th September, 1947. The reason for this is that during theformer period shipments from Canada, our major source of supply, are limited by the freezing of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence, and this is bound to restrict our imports from that source regardless of supply availability.4. During both periods sufficient supplies must be assured to maintain theUnited Kingdom stocks at a level which would involve no serious risk of break-down. The prudent minimum levels are now generally accepted as seven weeks&apos;wheat and four weeks&apos; flour consumption, and the statistics have been prepared on this basis. It would be possible for a period to maintain distribution on smallerstocks, but there would be no margin and any interruption or delay in the flow of imports would then result immediately in serious distribution difficulties. this consideration is particularly relevant during the winter months when bad weathermay lead to delay and irregular arrivals. A lower stock level than the prudentminimum could be justified only if there were absolute certainty of machinelikeregularity of future deliveries. But there can, in fact, be no such guarantee,particularly in view of all the supply and other difficulties which are likely to face us in the next twelve months, and it would be very imprudent to base&apos;our policy on any lower levels. We may well be forced below them in practice butthis is a different matter.5. It will be seen from Appendix III (Basis A) that, if the United kingdom were to receive during the period from the 1st October to the 31st May nextno more wheat/flour than we have at present in sight, it would be necessary toreduce the weekly flour off take to 79,800 tons, involving a drastic reductionin the basic bread/flour ration. In order to avoid this cut and maintain thepresent bread/flour ration level until the 31st May, 1947, we should need, inaddition to supplies at present in sight, an extra 675,000 tons (wheat equivalent),while in order to permit of virtually unrationed consumption to 31st May, 1947,we should need 967,000 tons.Prospects of additional supplies October-May 1947. :Canada.6. Canada can give no further assistance during this period, since herinternal movement resources are already fully mortgaged, and even if she could make more wheat available to the United Kingdom on paper, it could not be moved out of Canada until next June, arriving in June/July. Canada, unfor-unfortunately, has made a very poor start with the movement of wheat for currentexport, and for the building up of her Eastern seaboard stocks, and the latest information from Canada indicates that a backlog of over 330,000 tons on thefirst four months&apos; shipments will have to be carried over into the period May/September, 1947, since it cannot be made up during the winter months.   The
replenishment of the Eastern seaboard stocks is vital if Canada is to maintainher winter shipments at the required level;: failing full replenishment beforethe freeze-up we shall be depending for our imports upon winter all-rail move-ment which can easily be interrupted for many days at a time by snowstorms.The tables in Appendix III are based, on official Canadian estimates of available-bilities for shipment prepared after consultation on the 19th October with theWheat Committee of the Canadian Cabinet. These estimates take fully intoaccount all the factors which are operating in Canada in regard to supplies and movement, and while they are very disappointing, the figures must be accepted for present purposes as authoritative. It is hoped, however, that it will bepossible to secure for the United Kingdom some of the flour which is at presentdestined for other countries and 70,000 tons have been included in para-graph 10 on this account.United States.7. The close of navigation on the Great Lakes affects the United Statesexport capacity also, although not to the same extent. But there is little groundat present for thinking that the United States will be prepared to sell to theUnited Kingdom the quantities of wheat/flour required to balance the account,,in the absence of an approach on the highest level. An application was made through the British Food Mission in August last for 700,000 tons of wheat,but notwithstanding all the efforts of the Mission, no official response has yetbeen made by the United States, and the programme of shipments of cerealsfor the last quarter of 1946 from that country includes nothing for the UnitedKingdom against this request. In point of fact, the fourth quarter programme,plus the backlog of 900,000 tons carried over from August and September asa result of the succession of strikes, represents what is regarded as the practicalmaximum which the United States can physically export under present conditions,and any delivery to us, therefore, must be at the expense of other claimants. Theprogramme suggests that the Americans are seeking once again to play off theneeds of the British Zone of Germany, and indirectly of India, against those ofthe United Kingdom, and we do not feel justified in counting at present uponsecuring American wheat for the United Kingdom during the period to the 31stMay next. The British Food Mission support this view. No allowance has accordingly been made in paragraph 10 for any wheat receipts from the UnitedStates, but account has been taken of the possibility of securing some flour.A australia.8, It has hitherto been our policy to earmark the whole of the availableAustralian wheat and flour for India, South-East Asia, Ceylon, and other british colonies. While full information is not at present available, there is no doubtbut that India will need all the wheat which Australia can export during the calendar year 1947, and will require substantial supplies from elsewhere inaddition; the Colonies and South-East Asia will certainly need all the Australianflour available for export, and will also need the additional supplies which have-been allowed for in the overall statistical appreciation. No allowance has accordingly been made in paragraph 10 for any wheat or flour receipts from.Australia in direct aid of the United Kingdom position.Argentina.9. The only remaining source of supply is Argentina. It is believed thatsome old crop wheat is still available there for purchase and every effort is beingmade by the Ministry of Food to secure it. But the first charge on any remainingsupply will undoubtedly be for Spain, Brazil and other South American countries,and it is very doubtful whether it will be possible to ship any to the UnitedKingdom. The new wheat crop in the Argentine starts to move in volume inFebruary, and the Ministry is seeking to buy as much as possible. Given a goodcrop the purchase might amount to as much as 750,000 tons over the twelve months,notwithstanding the recent Argentine-Brazil agreement on wheat, but thequantity which could be moved and shipped per month would be limited by theinadequate internal transport facilities. In any event, the first arrivals in theUnited Kingdom could not be expected before March. The prospect of Argentinesupplies is at present more hopeful than of United States supplies, but it wouldbe imprudent to count upon receiving by the 31st May next more than 200,000^tons.   This view is confirmed by the British Food Mission in Argentina.   It is-[32599] b 3
also hoped to buy a small quantity of flour for arrival before the 31st May, 1947,and account has been taken of this in the figures.Summary of possible additional supplies to 31s2 May, 1947.10. Weighing up all the prospects on a quantitative basis, the UnitedKingdom, might receive up to the 31st May next 200,000 tons of wheat and120,000 tons of flour over and above the quantity so far budgeted for (Basis A),made up as follows : -- Wheat- Tons.From Argentina     - ...      ...      ...       ...       ... 200,000Flour Canada (additional to contract quantity) ...       ... 70,000Argentina/United States    ...      ...       ....... 50,000120,00011. An element of risk is involved in allowing for the additional supplies from Argentina at this stage, since the outturn of the wheat crop and the practiceof the Argentine Government in regard to export permits cannot be predicted.Assuming, however, that these additional quantities could be secured, the UnitedKingdom stock position would be approximately as shown in Appendix III(Basis B).Prospects of additional supplies, June-September 1947.Canada.12. It had been hoped that Canada would be willing to allot to the UnitedKingdom, if necessary at the expense of her other customers, a considerably greaterquantity of wheat/flour than the 160 million bushels for which she has contracted.But on the latest information this cannot now be reckoned upon. The latestquestionnaire issued by the elevator companies to all producers has revealed thatthe present intention of wheat growers is to deliver during the present crop year,August 1946-July 1947, only 311 million bushels against an estimated total crop of 420-440 million bushels. On the latter basis it was estimated that canada would have 250&apos; million bushels for export; on the former basis she will have only226 million bushels. Of this total 167 million bushels* have been earmarked forthe United Kingdom, leaving 45 million bushels of flour for export to countries other than the United Kingdom, and 13^ million bushels of wheat already sold to other countries, the net balance being only J million bushels (13,500 tons) forexport to the United Kingdom.13. The questionnaire figures can be taken as a reliable indication of canadian farmers&apos; present intentions in regard to the marketing of their wheat,but it does not follow that sales could not be improved to some extent by vigorouspropaganda on the part of the Canadian Government to reinforce the propagandaalready being undertaken to this end by the Canadian Wheat Board. The result,however, might be disappointing since there is no financial inducement to theCanadian producer to sell the maximum quantity of wheat under presentconditions. He is assured of a guaranteed domestic price at whatever time hechooses to sell, so that he loses nothing by holding his wheat. Farm stocks weredrained during the first half of 1946 to maximise wheat for export, and farmerswill wish to build up their farm reserves to some extent out of the current year&apos;production . It is also, unfortunately, the fact that an appreciable proportion ofthe crop, particularly in Northern Alberta, will be unmillable owing to frost andrain at harvest time, and will be used for livestock feeding.The latest report from Canada provides no ground for counting upon any additional supplies of old crop wheat from Canada during the period from june to September 1947, but 100,000 tons of new crop wheat may be availablefor shipment during September 1947 and the Basis A figures are compiled on these assumptions. It is, however, not unlikely that in practice small residualquantities Of old crop wheat will become available for shipment in August. TheBasis B figures accordingly include an additional shipment from Canada of100,000 tons in addition to the 100,000 tons for shipment in September 1947allowed for in Basis A.* The unshipped balance of this quantity has been included under Basis A. The figurediffers from the 161-3 million bushels shown in Appendix II because the latter covers theperiod October 1946-September, 1947,
United States and Argentina.14. The prospect of securing supplies from the United States for theperiod from June to September 1947 will be dependent upon the prospects of the1947 harvest, the degree of need of other claimants upon United States supplies,and the internal position in the United States. But pending an approach to theUnited States Government at the highest level, it would be imprudent to count upon any assistance from the United States during this period. Argentina again in the second period, therefore, is the more promising source. Given a goodharvest and provided that the Argentine Government is co-operative, we mightbe able to ship for arrival during the period from June to September next asmuch as 300,000 tons of wheat, and this has been taken into account inAppendix III (Basis B).World Cereals Position.15. In making these assessments, it has been assumed that we shallendeavour, regardless of other claimants, to secure our requirements from onesource or another. But we may find it difficult in practice to adhere to this line.No final assessment of the world position has yet been made by the CerealsCommittee of the I.E.F.C., but provisional estimates indicate that there will again be a net world cereals deficit in 1946-47 of several million tons. If this be confirmed, it will again be necessary, in order to balance the account, to cutclaimants&apos; requirements and the United Kingdom may and probably will beasked to make her contribution. Even if we were to refuse to do this, the objectcould be secured by the Cereals Committee in another way, by persuading the exporters Sub-Committee to cut the programmes of those countries, e.g., theBritish Zone of Germany, in which we have an interest, thereby bringing severepressure to bear upon us to divert some of our resources to make good the deficit.British Zone of Germany and India.16. No account has been taken throughout this review or in the statisticaltables of the requirements of the British Zone of Germany or of India, exceptin so far as the Australian wheat export surplus has been earmarked for her use,on the principle that both areas are independent claimants upon world supplies and are not the direct responsibility of the United Kingdom for this purpose.Areas of direct British Responsibility.17. Apart from the British Services overseas, the needs of which areincluded for convenience under this heading, the areas are :The Red Sea Area Palestine,Cyprus,Aden,Saudi Arabia,Egypt,Tripolitania,Sudan.Persian Gulf Area East Saudi Arabia,Gulf Sheikdoms,Anglo-Iranian Oil Company,which comprise the &quot;Middle East&quot;; and Malta,Gibraltar,Ceylon,Mauritius,Malaya,JJJong Kong,British Borneo..The cereals requirements of these areas are subjected to thorough scrutinyand are believed to represent their minimum import needs. The levels of consump-tion in some areas are deplorably low, notably in Malaya, where the combined

Basis &quot;A.&quot;(1) Extraction rate is maintained at 85 per cent, to end-June 1947, and at 80 per cent,thereafter;(2) Shipments to the United Kingdom are from assured sources, viz.: &apos;(a) Canada. (i) Balance of 160 million bushels contract (of which 500,000 tons flour), after.deducting the minimum wheat and flour requirements from Canada of those areas for which the United Kingdom is directly responsible for supplies. The monthlyCanadian shipping programme for wheat used in the calculations is that cabled from canada, on the 19th October, 1946.(ii) Shipment against the 1947-48 contract of 96,000 tons flour during August-&apos;September 1947, and 100,000 tons new crop wheat in September 1947.(b) United States. Unshipped balance of commitment of 456,000 tons;(c) Argentina. No shipments to United Kingdom assumed;(d) Australia. No shipments to United Kingdom assumed; it is estimated that,  afterproviding for India&apos;s needs, 34-5 million bushels of the Australian exportable surpluswill go towards meeting that part of the minimum requirements of areas of UnitedKingdom responsibility not shown at (a).iVo diversions to India or the British Zone of Germany have been allowed for.(3) Minimum stock requirement 1(a) &quot;Wheat.-The wheat equivalent of 7 weeks&apos; supply of flour, based on the estimated weekly deliveries and the extraction rate ruling during the succeeding period;(b) Flour. 4 weeks&apos; supply of flour, based on estimated weekly deliveries during,the succeeding period.(4) Deficit. Represents the quantity which it would be necessary to import, over and abovethe known availability as shown at (2) above, in order to build up indicated stocks to theminimum levels required.It will be noted that at end-May 1947, the deficit is 542,000 tons wheat and 112,000 tonsflour a, total in wheat equivalent of 675,000 tons. On the basis of .100,000 tons weekly flourdeliveries, the corresponding deficit would be 965,000 tons.Unless these deficits are made good, the position at end-September 1947 would show.a deficit of 1,093,000 tons wheat and 30,000 tons flour a total in wheat equivalent of 1,131,000 tons, or1,560,000 tons on the basis of an average weekly flour disappearance of 100,000 tons.Basis &quot; B.&quot;Basis &quot;B &quot; is calculated on assumptions similar to those in Basis &quot; A &quot; with the followingexceptions:  (1) Shipments to United Kindgom. It is assumed that the following supplies can be obtained in addition to those shown at (2) under Basis &quot; A &quot; :  (a). January /May 1947 Canada, 70,000 tons flour.Argentina, 200,000 tons wheat and 50,000 tons flour,(b) June/September 1947 Canada, 100,000 tons old crop residual for shipment in August 1947.Argentina, 300,000 tons wheat.(2) Veficit-The deficit at end-May 1946 is 316,000 tons wheat and 14,000 tons flour-a total in wheat equivalent of 332,500 tons. On the basis of 100,000 tons weekly flour deliveries the totaldeficit&apos; would be 630,000 tons.Unless these deficits are made good, the position at end-September 1947, would show a deficit of 403,000 tons wheat and 3,000 tons flour a total in terms of wheat equivalent of407,000 tons, or 836,000 tons on the basis of an average weekly flour disappearance of100,000 tons.
