SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 363.28th September, 1946.CABINET.SQUATTERS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a further Report submittedby the Acting Chairman of the Headquarters Official Committee on Squatters.I have approved the recommendation made in paragraph 4 of the Eeport.J C  EHome Office, S.W.1,28th September, 1946.THE Committee appointed in accordance with Conclusion 5 of the CabinetCommittee of the 20th August, 1946 (Gen. 146/1st Meeting), have held two further meetings since the Chairman&apos;s report of the 30th August.2. Two supplements have now been issued to the instructions issued on the24th August to the regional officers of the Departments concerned, advising them as to the action to be taken in dealing with properties occupied by squatters.Supplement No. 1, of the 7th September, embodied the instructions suggestedin paragraph 5 of the Chairman&apos;s report of the 30th August, which were approvedby the Cabinet Committee on the 7th September. It also reminded PrincipalHousing Officers that in oases where a redundant camp occupied by squattersis offered to the Ministry of Health by the Ministry of Works responsibility forthe requisitioning will be taken over by the Ministry of Health and the localauthority will be asked to manage the camp.Supplement No. 2, of the 14th September, described the procedure to befollowed where the holding Department or the Government Department to whom a camp has been allocated wish to make a case for eviction proceedings againstsquatters.   It instructs as follows :  &apos;&apos; The Regional Committee should investigate thoroughly the possibilitiesof alternative accommodation either for the Government Department con-cerned or for the squatters. The Ministry of Works will deal with alterna-tive accommodation for the Government Department, whose representative,if not a member of the Committee, should be invited to take part in the regional discussions.11 If all efforts to find a solution fail a full report should be submittedto the Ministry of Health, who will consult the interested Departments. Theywill examine the case in all its aspects. If, thereafter, the Minister of theDepartment seeking eviction of the squatters agrees that a case for evictionshould be put forward the matter will come before the Headquarters Com-mittee. The Headquarters Committee will invite the representative of the interested Government Department to state his case, and the report willfinally be submitted to the Ministerial Committee, together with the recoimmendations of the Headquarters Committee.&quot;The supplement also instructed that local authorities should be advised that allcaretakers of premises within their control should be warned to keep all doors,windows, &amp;c, locked and on no account or pretext to admit unauthorised persons;[32458]
and that the Police, who will be ready to respond to such calls, should be called to prevent unauthorised entries.In addition to these supplements an urgent message was sent on   the10th September to the Principal Housing Officers of the Ministry of Health, in   .accordance with a decision of the Cabinet, that where any houses or flats areseized by squatters water, gas and electricity should be withheld.3.   With reference to paragraph 4 of the Chairman&apos;s previous report, threeweekly returns have now been received.These indicate that by the 14th September in England and Wales 921 campshad been occupied by approximately 33,168 persons.   Of these camps &apos;99 were understood to be still required by the Service Departments;43 were required by the Ministry of Works for other GovernmentDepartments;563 had been offered to local authorities for housing purposes;216 information as to the status of the camp was not available.Of the 563 camps offered to local authorities, in the case of 515 the localauthorities had made the necessary emergency arrangements in regard to water,sanitation, &amp;c. In 329 cases local authorities had made arrangements either to manage the camps on behalf of the Ministry of Health or to take them over.Six hundred and twenty-nine empty camps had not been occupied bysquatters. Of these, 219 were required for retention by the Service Departments,325 had been declared redundant and of these 63 had been offered to localauthorities for housing purposes.In Scotland 152 camps had been occupied by approximately 7,534 persons.Of these camps, seven were understood to be required for retention by the service departments, five were required by other Government Departments and 48 hadbeen offered to local authorities for housing purposes. The holding departments are considering which of the remaining 92 camps they may require. As regardscamps offered to local authorities, it appeared that the authorities would in most cases accept the camps where they were of good construction.Empty camps not occupied by squatters numbered nine, of which two were required for retention by the Service Departments. Seven camps had been declared redundant, and seven had been offered to local authorities for housing-purposes.4.   The Cabinet have recently decided (a-) that where any houses or flats are seized by squatters services- water,gas and electricity- shall be withheld;(b) that similar measures shall be taken in the case of all property in thecontrol of local authorities which is seized.The Service Departments and other Government Departments holding camps arein doubt whether the same principles apply to camps invaded by squatters which,however, the Departments intend to retain. The Committee suggest that the answer should be in the affirmative and that Service and other holding Depart-ments should be instructed to withhold all services other than water in such caseswhere a camp either has already been invaded by squatters or may be so invadedin the future.20th September, 1946.
