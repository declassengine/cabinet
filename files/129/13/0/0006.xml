(lj.6) 32ndMeeting, Minute hr)  the Lord President&apos;s Committee consideredthe annexed memorandum (L. ?.

The Lord President&apos;s Committee felt that, providedthat conditions under which Danish meat was imported were asstringent as those imposed in the case of Argentine meat,the proposal to import Danish moat into the United kingdom should be approved,  on the understanding that should the prevalence of foot and mouth disease on the Continent increase to such an extent as to add materially to the risks involvedin importing Danish meat,  the Minister of Pood would consult with the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries with a viewto deciding whether the import of Danish meat should not be stopped,  and that,  in the event of disagreement,  the two ministers should refer the matter to the President of theBoard of Trade for decision.-      The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries does not sue his way to accept this conclusion andhas ashed that the matter should be referred to the Cabinet.Lj., The Cabinet are accordingly asked to decide whether,as proposed by the Lord President&apos;s Committee,  the import of Danish meat into the United Kingdom should be approved,subject to the safeguards indicated in paragraph 3*II.

/L.P.C46) 237?cabinet lord presidents committeePROPOSAL TO IMPORT DANISH MEATJoint Memorandum by the Minister- of Food, andthe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.1.      The Minister of Food is seriously concerned at the meatposition for 192+7.      It is clearly of very great importance tomaintain the present meat ration;    in addition it is now proposedto give underground miners an additional meat ration of 1/- per -week, with a corresponding concession to Category A canteenscatering for other specially heavy workers.2.      Supply is very tight.      Some concession on quantities hashad to be given to the Argentine Government in the new meatcontract, under which we are to get only 85% of the Argentineexportable surplus.      The Meat Division of the Ministry of Poodreports that on the most favourable assumption there is still a deficiency of some 120,00C tons (out of 1,930,000 tons requiredfor all purposes)  in order to maintain the present meat ration,and to give the proposed concessions to the miners,  during 1947-3.      Any new source of supply is therefore of great importance.Denmark is now offering us meat in appreciable quantities.22,000 tons  of this meat has already been purchased and is being held in Denmark as its importation into this country is not permitted, under Ministry of Agriculture regulations designed to combat Root and Mouth disease.      Up to 30,000 tons more Danishmeat can,  it is believed, be purchased during 1947.      If ways and means can be found of Importing this Danish meat into theUnited Kingdom without increasing the risk of Foot  and mouth disease,  the gap between available supplies and requirements will be largely bridged.      72,000 tons represents about 2-g- weeks of the present domestic carcase meat ration.      If it is decidedthat this Danish moat cannot be imported,  the Ministry of Poodcould not recommend the granting of the proposed additional meat to miners and can hold out little prospect of the maintenance ofthe carcase meat ration during 1947-4.      The Minister of Rood has discussed this matter with theMinister of Agriculture and, being unable to secure agreement tothe embargo on the importation of Danish meat being lifted,  thequestion is by agreement referred to the Lord Presidents Committeefor decision.3*      Below are appended (A) a statement from the Minister ofAgriculture setting forth the objections to the importation ofthe Danish meat:    (b)  a statement by the Minister of Rood setting forth ways and means by which,  it is submitted,  these objectionscan be overcome.j. s.T.

ANNEX(A)      OBJECTIONS TO THE IMPORTATION OF DANISH MEATNotea-by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries.      The Minister of Agriculture,  as one. of the Ministersresponsibly for home agriculture and the one particularlycharged with the duty of safeguarding this country from theintroduction of animal disease, must point out the objections to,and submit a serious warning against,  the proposal to importfresh meat from Denmark.2.      For many years, Foot and Mouth disease has properly been regarded as the most menacing of all epizootic diseases fromthe point of view of animal husbandry,  including milk production.Meat,  whether fresh,  chilled or frozen,  is a dangerous carrier ofthe disease and it is particularly dangerous when,  as now,household swill (often containing scraps of,  and drippings from,meat) must be used to supplement other feeding stuffs.      Ashort note of the circumstances in which the,existing embargo onthe importation of fresh meat from the Continent was imposed in1926 is given in the appendix to these notes.5-      The few figures given there also indicate the extent towhich serious outbreaks of Foot and Mouth disease might .imperil our cattle population and thus the supply of milk - forwhich we are entirely dependent on home production - and of meat.      Since 1942,  we have fortunately been free from massiveoutbreaks:    but the risk is one to be avoided at any reasonablecos t .U.      Although it is known that the virus of Foot and mouth disease is not destroyed by either chilling or freezing, we havehad to go on importing large quantities of meat from SouthAmerica - particularly from Argentina - in order to maintaineven the wartime meat ration;    and we have had to go on doingthat  even though we knew that Foot and Mouth disease was alwayspresent in South American countries.      We have, however,  done our best in various directions to confine and reduce that risk.      Inparticular, we have two veterinary officers of our own stationed in Argentina whose  job it is to see that inspection and otherprecautions there are kept at as high a standard as possible;the Minister of Food &quot;zones1 supplies of South American meat soas to keep them out of our main dairying and livestock areas;and every effort is made to ensure that swill is sterilisedbefore being fed to animals.      By such methods as these riskshave been reduced;    but they have by no means been eliminated.5.      If we now started to import Danish meat again, we should extend the risk in several ways:-(i)    There were 388 outbreaks of Foot and mouth disease in Denmark in the first half of this year;but that by no means defines the danger.      Denmark,like other V/estern European countries,  suffers at times from large and rapidly spreading epidemics.During the series of outbreaks in Europe in the 1920s,there were only 64 outbreaks in Denmark in 1923, but8,000 in 192k,  34,000 in 1925 and 97,000 in 1926.During the still more devastating series in1937 end 1936 (which spread northwards through france to Germany and the countries bordering the North Sea,and involved many hundreds of thousands of outbreaks)there were only 13 in Denmark in 19375 but 9k,000 in1938.      The method of control now adopted in Denmark-2-

is not by slaughter, but by the vaccination of cattle        1 (within a radius of about two miles round infected farms.      *Although the Danish veterinary service is good,  there isvery grave doubt indeed whether this method would be effective in stopping the spread of disease should there be another serious epidemic.(ii)    Where animals are slaughtered in the early stages of infection (before clinical signs appear),  thevirus of the disease persists for a long time in the blood, bones and sinews.      Infected   carcases from denmark or other near European countries could be shipped to this country before the disease had beendiagnosed,  or even suspected,   in the herds from whichthey came.      To some extent,   there is some natural safe-guard in the case of Argentine meat in that most animalshave to travel long distances from farm to slaughterhouse.Animals are not allowed to be sent away from infectedfarms\    but where infection exists, though it has not yet reached the stage of being apparent, the time spent on the journey is often sufficient to cover the incubative stage.Moreover,  at the end of the journey animals are held for2h.-U8 hours for rest and observation before slaughter.By the end of this t ime some,  at least, of any infectedanimals would usually be showing clinical signs&quot;    andunder an agreement with Argentina,  such animals and anyothers that have travelled with them must not be includedin shipments to Great Britain.      Arrangements for thereproduction,   if this were feasible, of the safeguardingfeatures inherent In Argentina conditions would at bestonly eliminate one of the risks and objections involvedin the importantion of Danish meat.      The others remain.(iii)    If once the principle of the embargo oncarcases from European countries were broken by allowingDanish meat to come in,  it would be impossible tomaintain it in relation to other such countries whichwere no more potentially dangerous than Denmark fromthe disease standpoint;    nor in ail probability would itbe easy to discriminate against countries which for one reason or another were potentially more dangerous.(iv)    It cannot be agreed that the extent of the risk is related solely to the number of tons of meat imported from countries in which infection exists,  regardless of whether the meat comes from one such country or more.Since different countries are subject to waves ofinfection at different times, the greater the number of potential sources of infection,  the greater the riskeven with the same quantity of meat.(v)    The widening of the opportunities of intro-ducing infection would make it much more difficult to trace the origin of any given outbreak.      Argentineopinion is dispos.ed - quite naturally - to defend their- system of inspection and to suggest that outbreaks inGreat Britain attributed- to Argentine meat might haveoriginated elsewhere.      If new grounds were given on which, this case could be argued,  it might be harder than ever to keep Argentina up to present standards even if the newsupplying countries had to submit to similar conditions.6.      This country has long had a name and a market abroad forpedigree livestock of the highest quality.      Our position asexporters is already prejudiced by the disease risks that we are compelled to run.      For instance,  the United States - one of our,best customers in the past - will not take our animals exceptthrough Canada, where they are required to remain for 60 days before proceeding over the border.      Some other markets remain-3-

open to as only so long as we can show that disease here is of no more than a sporadic character.      Our difficulties will increaseif we open the door to direct infection frora the Continent.-    andeven one &quot;bad series of outbreaks originating from this sourcemight result in many overseas markets being closed to us for along time.      We ought not  to imperil our reviving livestockexport trade in this way.7.      For those reasons,  the removal of the embargo on theimportation of meat from Europe, which has now been in existencefor 20 years,  would certainly fill the farming community withdismay.      Apart from the practical point that the risk of importing disease wculd be increased by opening another door toinfection,  thus adding to the grave disabilities under which live-stock production is already labouring,  there is the psychologicalpoint that the proposed action might well discourage the expansionof both milk and meat production at home.      Debates in the Houseduring the last year or so have indicated how strongly farminginterests feel even against the risks associated with theimportation of South American meat.      to add to those risks andto that feeling at this present time,  and for the sake of a relatively small quantity of meat,   seems to be quite unjustifiable.8.      The problem would be solved without all this disturbance ifmeans  could be found to dispose of any small European surpluseson the Continent of Europe, and to make up any deficit at home from lores en t sources of supply.APPENDIXCircumstances of the erobargo on the import of fresh meat from Europe.      &apos;1.      For very many years this country has been subject to out-breaks of Foot and Mouth disease.      In 1922,  one of the mostdevastating invasions of this disease that Great Britain has ever experienced began with an outbreak among pigs at Hull.The epidemic lasted for five years,  with some intermissions, and during that time there were nearly 5,000 outbreaks,  involving the slaughter of over 300,000 animals at a cost in compensation of more than  h,000,000.2.      During the same period, an epidemic was raging in Europe.While the origins of outbreaks of disease in this country couldnot definitely be established,  they were generally ascribed toinfection introduced from the Continent.3-      In 1926, the disease flared up in Scotland.      It was tracedto pig carcases,   imported from the Continent for curing intobacon,  and found to be infected with Foot and Mouth disease.Similarly infected carcases were found at Kilmarnock, Thornhill,Carlisle-and on the quay at Lelth.      An Order was accordinglymade under the Diseases of Animals Acts prohibiting theimportation of meat from Europe.      (Incidentally,  Foot and Mouthhas never been traced, to imported cured bacon) .h.      Prom 1927 onwards, the incidence of the disease lessened,both in Europe ana at home and,  apart from outbreaks of a sporadiccharacter, this country was reasonably free from the disease until19.37,  when it surged up again in Europe - this time with muchgreater severity than the earlier epidemic - and continued Intothe  following year.      Whilst the disease was heavy in western europe,  there were numerous invasions of this country,  attributed to migratory birds::    but in the two years we had but 377 out-breaks,   involving the slaughter of 55,000 animals at a cost of,6508,000,&apos;-. &apos; -h- :

5.      The two series of outbreaks in this country were not strictlycomparable.      It was estimated that,  in the 1922 series, the seedsof some 700 or 800 outbreaks were sown at Hull before the presenceof the disease was discovered;    and the veterinary staff availableto cope with an epidemic was much smaller then than in 1937.While, therefore,  the difference in intensity of the two outbreakshere - in marked contrast to what happened in Europe - cannot be claimed to be wholly due to the embargo on continental meatimposed in 1926,  it must be accepted that the embargo andassociated precautions have limited our risks of infection from europe to that carried by uncontrollable agencies,  such as bymigratory birds.(3)    ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF THE IMPORTATION OF THE DANISH MEATNotes by,the Minister of food.      Paragraphs I to 3 of the notes by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries emphasise the importance of reducing the risk ofoutbreaks of Foot and Mouth disease in this country;, in view ofthe grave consequences to British agriculture which such outbreaksinevitably entail.      The Minister of Food wishes to emphasise thathe agrees wholly with this part of the Minister of Agriculturefsstatement.      The Minister of Food points out that his interestin the maintenance of the home production of meat and of milk&quot; isat least as keen as that of the Minister of Agriculture.Therefore the Minister of Food would .never,  In his own interests,do anything which his veterinary experts advise would increase therisk of outbreaks of Foot and Mouth disease in this country.The question at issue is not,   therefore, whether it is important to minimise the risk of outbreaks of Foot and Mouth disease.It is, of course?  common, ground between the two Ministers thatthis is an objective of the highest importance.      The sole issue is whether the importation of Danish meat will Increase this riskas against the importation of Argentine meat.2.      Paragraph L of the Minister of Agriculture &apos;s paper showsclearly that a risk of causing outbreaks of Foot and Mouth diseasein this country is inevitably incurred by the importation of argentine meat.      Yet the Minister of Agriculture has neversuggested that wo should do without this Importation.      Nor is heat the moment objecting to our strenuous efforts to increase theimportation of Argentine meat.      The Minister of Agriculturementions the methods by which we seek to minimise these risks,i.e. stationing British veterinary officers in the Argentine, thezoning of the distribution of supplies of Argentine meat andefforts to sterilise swill from such meat.      All these threeprecautions would be taken in the cose of the&apos; importation of danish meat,-and the agreement of the Danish Government to the stationing of British veterinary officers in Denmark has been secured.3.      Paragraph 5(i)  of the Minister of Agriculture&apos;s paper gives the figures showing the number of outbreaks (388 in the first half of this year)  of Foot and Mouth disease in Denmark.      these may sound alarming until it is realised that the Argentinerefuses to give us any figures at all as to the number of out-breaks of Foot and Mouth disease in the Argentine.      Theveterinary advisers to the Minister of Food state that it is clearthat the figures of Argentine outbreaks would be far higher thanthe Danish if they were known.      Therefore the figures suggestthat the Danish meat,  far from being more dangerous than

the Argentine,  is considerahly safer,    since the Danish methodof the notification of inspection of the disease is far betterthan the Argentine.     Figures are then, given by the Minister ofAgriculture cf the alarming number (97,000) of outbreaks of Footand Mouth disease in Denmark in 1926 and in 1938 (9h,000).      Itmust be pointed out, however,  that what Is in question is theamount cf Foot and Mouth disease existing in Denmark today ascompared with the amount of Foot and Mouth disease existing inthe Argentine today.      If c. new epidemic of Foot  and mouth disease breaks out in Denmark,  then of course the importationof Danish meat would be instantly stopped.      The third pointmade in the Minister of Agriculture&apos;s paragraph 5(i) is thatthe Danes do net slaughter their beasts when an outbreak of Footand. Mouth disease occurs.      But neither do the Argentines,  and,it is repeated, what is in question is tne relative danger of theimportation of Danish end Argentine neat.If.      The Minister of Agriculture Ms paragraph 5(1-0 argues thatDanish meat may be sore dangerous than Argentine because of the shorter journeys on the average between the Danish farm and the danish slaughterhouseP as compared with the Argentine farm andthe Argentine slaughterhouse,     This gives a shorter period inthe case of Danish meat for signs of the disease to show afterthe animal has left the farm-      This is no doubt a sound point,but it could be wholly met by imposing, as a condition of importation,  that the Danish animals are held in the slaughter-house for the appropriate period,  2k*  or U6 hours if necessary,so that the average time taken between farm and slaughterhouseis made the same in Denmark as in the Argentine.     The Ministerof Food is perfectly willing to take this matter up with the danes.5.     The Minister of Agriculture&apos;s note, paragraph 5(iii),argues that If we import Danish meat we might commit ourselves to importing meat from other European countries, some or all ofwhich may be far more seriously infected with Foot and mouth disease.      It is submitted that there is no force in this contention.     Surely we cannot Justify denying to the british public sorely needed meat from a source at least as safe as oneof our main existing sources in case we should be tempted at comelater date to commit the folly of importing from a dangeroussource..6.     Paragraph .5(1 v) of the Minister of Agriculture Ms paperargues that the risk Is Increased If more than one source of imported meat supplies Is drawn upon, since the waves ofInfection occur in different countries at different times.Surely this point is met if It is agreed, as of course it is,,that should en epidemic of Foot and&quot;Mouth disease  occur   in denmark, the Imports from that source will be immediately stopped.It may be worth mentioning In this connect Ion that It is verydifficult to know what we should do if an epidemic of Foot andMouth disease occurs In the Argentine.      We should have far lessnotice of the appearance of such an epidemic In the Argentine^since the Argentine authorities refuse to give us anything likesuch goon statistics as the outbreaks of Foot and Mouth diseaseas the Danes,  end3  second, the meat supplies of this country would be so gravely crippled by - the cessation of Argentineimports that It would &quot;be a most serious step to refuse them.Therefore en both accounts the risk we shall aaur if there is awave of enidemic in Denmark Is the smaller..

7.      Paragraph 5(v)  of the Minister of Agriculture&apos;s notessuggests that to draw meat from Denmark would make it harderto maintain our existing precautions, such as the presence ofBritish veterinary surgeons in the Argentine.      This is no doubta sound point if we did not impose equally stringent conditions on the Danes - even though with their better veterinary servicethey are not  in fact so necessary.      But it is agreed by theMinister&apos; of pood that these conditions should all be imposed onthe Danes,  in order that the Argentine authorities should haveho excuse for asking for any relaxation..8.      Paragraph 6 of the Minister of Agriculture&apos;s notesemphasises the importance to our pedigree livestock exports,  of keeping this country free of Foot and Mouth disease.      Theimportance of this consideration is,  of course,  agreed, but thequestion at issue is whether the importation of Danish as againstArgentine meat does in fact increase the risk.      And,  for thereasons given,  it seems clear that the importation of any givenquantity of meat from Denmark is in fact safer than the import-ation of the same quantity of meat from the Argentine.9-      Paragraph 7 of the Minister of Agriculture &apos; s note statesthat the farming community would, be filled with dismay by theimportation of Danish meat,  since farming interests have shown inthe House that they feel strongly against the risks associatedwith the importation of Argentine meat.      It is no doubt thecase that the farming community would be greatly re-assured ifit were possible to dispense with Argentine meat and to confineour meat imports to areas free from Foot and Mouth disease,   suchas our Dominions.      But no-one suggests that this is a possibility.Therefore if meat has to be brought in,  as it has,   from countries where Foot and Mouth disease exists, we should bring in our supplies from the less dangerous countries rather than the more dangerous.      And all the evidence shows that Denmark is a lessdangerous rather than a more dangerous source than the Argentine.,This should be clearly explained to the farmers,   so that theywill be re-assured that no increased risk was being incurred.10.    Paragraph 8 suggests that  the difficulty could be avoidedby diverting meat surpluses to  the continent of Europe and by making   up any deficit at home from present sources of supply. -Nothing would be easier of course than to buy,  for example,  the danish surplus of 70,000 tons and distribute it in Europe;    butthis would, not give any meat to the British people,  which is whatis required.      If It were possible to make up the deficit in thiscountry from present sources of supply this,  of course, wouldhave been done.      Unfortunately every available ton from theDominions and from the Argentine is already being imported.
