THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY of HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1946.SECRET. CoPy No-CP. (46) 373.nth October, 1946.CABINET.GENERAL ASSEMBLY  OF THE UNITED NATIONS:INDIAN COMPLAINT AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The Indian Complaint.Item 31 on the provisional agenda of tihe United Nations General Assemblyreads as follows : &apos;&apos; Treatment of Indian nationals in the Union of South Africa.(Item proposed by the Government of India).&quot;2. The Government of the Union of South Africa passed in June 1946the Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Act which (a) imposescertain limitations on the ownership of property by Asiatics, and (6) extends alimited franchise to the Indian population. The Government of India claim that this legislation was undertaken by the Union Government without consulta-tion with the Government of India and that the Union Government have thusunilaterally repudiated the so-called Capetown Agreement of 1926 between thetwo Governments. The Lnion Government, who have passed this legislation in response to a demand that some legislation should be enacted regulating thepurchase by the community of Indian origin in Natal of properties in pre-dominantly European areas, are likely to maintain that no international obligationis constituted by the Capetown Agreement, and that for this and other reasons the question is one of South African domestic jurisdiction, of which the united nations are not authorised to take cognizance. (United Nations Charter,Article 2 (7).)   [Text in footnote^1)]Possible Policies.3. The discussion in the Assembly of this dispute between two membersof the British Commonwealth places the United Kingdom, as a leading memberof the United Nations, in an embarrassing position. We should no doubt firstseek to take any opportunity to promote conciliation and a settlement out of courtbefore the issue actually comes up for debate; but we cannot count on this possibility, as the Government of India have on a number of occasions emphasised the importance they attach to the item. Failing this, our policy ought no doubtto be to avoid becoming involved in this dispute further than is essential. the alternatives, in fact, appear to be to (i) Confine ourselves to stating that, since the dispute lies between two members of the Commonwealth, we will take no part at all in thediscussions.(ii) Explain that we do not intend to express a view on the merits of theIndian complaint but would confine ourselves to discussion on the propriety of that complaint in view of Article 2 (7) of the Charter.If we did this we could go on to argue (a) that the case does not fall under Article 2 (7), because, quite apartfrom the question of a broken agreement, the treatment of a population of Indian origin by the South African Governmenthas produced friction and because the Charter imposes certain obligations in connexion with human rights; or alternatively(&apos;) &quot; Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorise the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter ; but this principle shall not prejudice the application of enforcement measures under Chapter VII &quot;13623   [32556]
(b) that, as the Indians concerned are almost entirely South Africannationals, the matter is covered by Article 2 (7). Under thispolicy we could also, if necessary, express the view that the human rights provisions in the Charter constitute provisionsdirecting action to be taken in the future (i.e., by special con-ventions, &amp;c).I dismiss the remaining theoretical alternative : (iii) to enter into the dispute wholeheartedly on the side of either India or south africa as being incompatible with what, is said at the beginning of this paragraph.Recommendation. ,4. I recommend that the United Kingdom representative should beauthorised, subject to the general remarks at the beginning of paragraph 3 above,to support policy (ii) (&amp;) in that paragraph.Reasons for Recommendation.5.   My reasons for the recommendation are : (a) Course (i) is irreconcilable with our position in the United Nations.(b) While it is inevitable that any attitude adopted by us will give someoffence to one side or the other, the line suggested here is the leastlikely to give deep offence to either.(c) The course proposed safeguards the interests of the administration of theBritish Colonial Empire by asserting the authority of Article 2 (7) ofthe Charter, and(d) By interpreting the human rights provisions of the Charter as under-takings for the future rather than as binding obligations for thepresent, it places on record our view that before we bind ourselves toprecise obligations for the enforcement of human rights, we must firstagree internationally what these rights mean.Some Further Points of Detail.6. The following further points will have to be borne in mind in taking adecision.(a) A number of leading Indians of moderate views in South Africa are infavour of an effort to avoid discussion in the Assembly. The SouthAfrican Government would probably also like to do this, but it isprobable that the Indian Government having pressed the matter sofar, would now find it difficult to withdraw.(6) The Indian community concerned consists almost entirely of SouthAfrican born South African nationals and not of nationals of India.It numbers about 266,000 people.(c) It has hitherto been the practice for intra-Commonwealth relationshipsnot to be discussed in an international assembly. It seems mostimportant for the future of the Commonwealth that as far as possiblethe United Kingdom should preserve a strictly impartial attitude on the merits of the case. This applies equally to our relationship with South Africa (particularly when Field-Marshal Smuts eventuallypasses from the scene) and to the future relationship of India to theBritish Commonwealth as a whole.(d) The Assembly caiinot act; it can only recommend.   While, however, the debate might end with a simple recommendation to the parties to get together and agree on a solution, the discussion is sure to range overthe merits of the case.: (e) It is almost certain that the Soviet will support the Indian case but it is improbable that the Indians will secure a majority vote.E.
