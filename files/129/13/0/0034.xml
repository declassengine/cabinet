(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE]PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET &apos; COPY NO.  jP^G.P.;:.(a6);&apos; 38k17TH OCTOBER,   19I4.6CABINETECONOMIC PLANNING-:__CO-ORDINATION. OF THE german economy WITH THE UNITED kingdom memorandum &quot;by the. Lord President of the CouncilIn looking at the prospect thrown up &quot;by theUnited Kingdom Economic Survey, of an almost indefinite period of man-power stringency and of having to postponemany desirable projects considerably after 1950 owing tolock of man-power, I am impressed by the need for developing the German economy,  so far as it lies within our power,  asan auxiliary to our own long-term economic plans.      In the short-term we are already, doing this to some extent,notably in exploiting German timber to relieve the timbershortage.      The immediate possibilities are, however,severely limited by the German food, fuel,  steel, housing,transport,  and other shortages.      Indeed we are threatened with further heavy demands for assistance to Germany, and unless we can work out medium and long-term demands whichwe con satisfy from Germany over a period of years, we willjust be pouring money down the drain.      Moreover until suchplans are made the British administration in Germany and theGermans themselves must suffer from lack of guidance.2, Our bargaining power also is prejudiced by thefact that both the Russians and the French have longpossessed clear-cut ideas, not only on how they wish to tackle their own economic reconstruction, but also on the contribution which they can draw from Germany.      Forexample, the French demand for extracting the greatestamount of raw coal out of the Ruhr has very largelyprevailed over any alternative polios^ of extracting fromGermany other products whose production directly or indirectly requires the use of cool.      This has strangledGerman industry, deprived us of     useful supplies whichcould otherwise be made available,  and vastly increased theburden on the Treasury.3. Can we afford to go on diverting British man-power on the present scale to assist Germany without any plans for re-payment in kind?      Should not we examine our&apos; forwarddemands for industrial products and ascertain which items and what quantities of these requirements might be obtained fromGermany during the years 19*4-7/51 and on what conditions?On the face of it our control over the largest industrial area in Europe should help to supplement our own productionand to smash bottle-necks in our own economic plans.      on present indications,  however,  it looks like proving nothing but a continuing drag on our economy.

h. Again, in considering our long-terra exportpolicy,  should we not also consider how to stimulatecertain sections and damp down other sections of german industry in order to ensure that German exports - particularly from the British Zone - become complementary to,  ratherthan competitive with, British exports?     We should notoverlook the possibilities of accepting German goods herein order to enable us to export more of our own productionin suitable lines to the rest of the world.      It isparticularly important to establish the future German exportpattern now on lines which are acceptable to us and can beexpected to remain economic after our direct control is removed.      If Germany is not to remain a mill-stone round ournecks she must export.      Let us see that she exports to us the things we need and to others the things which we do notmind their getting from Germany.5. I have confined myself to those aspects of long-term German economic development which vitally affectUnited Kingdom economic planning,  but  I recognize thatthere are many others.      I hope that when the foreign secretary begins his discussions, on tie future of Germany,he will be able to say that he has in sight large economicdemands which we propose making on Germany over a considerable period in return for the goods and services which Germany isdrawing and must continue to draw from us,  and that we intend to insist that the German economy shall be restored to health without delay sufficiently to meet these demands and similar demands which other United nations may have to make.This will,  of course, imply a long-term plan of highlyselective rehabilitation of German industry and transport andwill also imply limiting for example the export of raw coal from Germany,  where such export is liable to cripple the rehabilitation of German industry to meet our demands andthe restoration of German capacity to pay for imports.6. I hope,  therefore, my colleagues will agree(a) To invite the President of the Board of Tradeand the Ministers of Works, Fuel and Power,and Transport in consultation with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster toreport on the quantities of different types of goods required for United Kingdom economic development and maintenance which might besupplied by Germany over the five years19h7/51  &amp;nd on the measures and supplies from us which would be necessary to enablethese goods to be obtained from Germany,(b) To invite the president of the Board of Tradein consultation with the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs,  the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster to report on the scale and directionof Gernian exports,  which should be encouragedin order to ensure that Germany can pay for imports and repay our current assistance withoutcompeting undesirably with British exports.H.M.Privy Council Office,  s.w.1.17th October,  19b6.
