Just before the Chancellor of the Exchequer left for ITorth America a message was received from Sir JamesGrigg, Alternate Governor of the International    monetary fund, suggesting that the international monetary machineryought not to be used for this purpose.      I feel strongly that we should assert the obligation of the international monetary Fund and the International Bank for reconstruction and Development to co-operate to the fullest extent in makinginternational full employment policy effective and that our representatives on the institutions concerned should be left in no doubt on this point,  even if it mag be consideredtactically advisable to deal at this stage only in very general terms with those -parts of the problems which are the direct concern of the new financial institutions, as isproposed in paragraph 6 of the attached joint paper by theTreasury,  the Board of Trade and the Economic Section.H.M.privy Gounc i1 Office,  S.W.130th September,  1946.

IHTlulITATIOITAL BMPLOBC5HT POLICY(jote prepared in the ^reosury,  the Board of Trade. ond the Economic Section)1 * It is necessary to consult Ministers on the linowhich the United Kingdom Delegation should take on employment Policy at the forthcoming international discussions in preparation  for the proposed international conference on Trade and Employment.      During October and thefirst part of govember preliminary discussions arc to takeplace, first, with representatives of the Dominions and,motor, with representatives of the wider group of countrieswhich constitute the Preparatory Commission  sat up by theEconomic and Social Council to prepare for the world conference.2. It is agreed that the United Kingdom Delegation  at these discussions should emphasise the internationalimportance of the problem of maintaining full employment.It is the declared policy of His majesty&apos;s Government to take all possible domestic measures to maintain a high and stable level of demand tor labour.      This country is,  however,inevitably peculiarly sensitive to external economic developments;    and for this reason any international actionwhich is possible for the maintenance of full employment will be of particular importance to the successful prosecution ox the United Kingdom&apos;s domestic plans.3. There is, moreover,  a particular reason why,  atthe forthcoming international conversations,  the UnitedKingdom Delegation should be in a position to take a constructive line on this question.       &apos;. number of countries,and In particular Australia, New Zealand,  end some of theWestern Europeans1, lay very great emphasis on the Importanceof international employment  policies.       :australia and now Zealand in particular should find less difficulty in accepting some of the commercial obligations which are contained in  the Trade Proposals to which we have pledgedour general support,  if they can be a. ssured that seriousattention is being paid to the problems of preventing world-wide depression and unemployment.      It will, therefore,greatlj&quot; ease our forthcoming negotiations on commercial policy,if we are able to take a positive lead in proposals aboutEmp1oyment po1icy.h\. More generally, it is perhaps arguable that thiscountry has an important role to  play in  showing that a free society can engage in sufficient economic planning to prevent serious economic depressions.      The forthcoming conference on Trade and Employment would provide aninternational forum for this purpose,  if we were preparedto consider the Employment policy work of the conferencecs an important element in its activity.&apos;5. The Treasury,  Board of Trade and Economic Sectionhave oreoorod a full technical brief for our delegation onthis subject.      This brief, which ia too detailed for Cabinetcirculation, ma;- he  summarised as follows:-

(i)    In the first place, it emphasises the importanceof effective domestic policies in the main industrial countries for the  maintenance of a high arid stable level of demand.      It suggests that it must be a basic element in any international Employment Policy to secure Iron Governments -particularly Governments of the main trading nations - anunambiguous recognition of their responsibilities in this regard, and that Governments should undertake to partioipatein arrangements under the sponsorship of the JEcohoniic and social council of the United Nations Organisation for the collection,analysis and exchange of information on domestic employmentproblems, trends and policies.       his is perhaps the mose essential feature of international employment policy,  since,if the main industrial countries can be encouraged to adoptsuccessful policies to maintain their own internal demand, for goods and services,  no world--wide depression need ever develop.(ii)    The brief goes on to argue,  however,  that whileeverything should be done to encourage and to enable individual countries to adopt effective internal employment policies,  itwould be foolish to wort: on the assumption that there will never be another world depression.      In the event of another worlddepression,   a country which,  like the United Kingdom, wasattempting &apos;by domestic measures to maintain employment, mightrun into serious difficulties with its balance of payments,since the world, demand for its exports would bo falling off ata time when it was maintaining its own internal demand for imports.      For this reason,  the brief stresses the importanceof the provisions  in the various international  economic agreements,which enable countries to safeguard, their balances of paymentswhen they would, otherwise be seriously unfavourable.      In thisconnection,  it underlines in particular:(a) the fact that under the Trade Proposals a country with on adverse balance of payments would be permitted to maintain non-discriminatory quantitativeimport restrictions, while countries with favourablebalances of payments would not be allowed to do so;(b) the fact that under the International iionctcry Funda country whose balance of payments was in fundamentaldisequilibrium would be permitted to depreciate itsexchange rate, while those countries which wereenjoying a favourable balance of payments would not be permitted to retaliate;    and(c) the fact that a country whose demand for importsrapidly declined as a result of an  uncontrolledinternal slump In its purchasing, power would find its currency becoming &quot;scarce&quot; in the international monetary Fund,  in which case other countries couldimpose disorimi.notory restrictions on imports fromthe country which was constituting the centre ofinfection.(iii)    While the encouragement of effective domesticemployment policies,  combined with special safeguards forunfavourable balances of payments must,  in present conditions,constitute the basis of  any effective international employment policy,  the brief nevertheless goes on to enumerate a number of ways in which International,  as opposed to national,  action might be taken as a contribution to the problem of maintainingworld demand in times of world depression.      In particular,-2-

soit suggests (a) that as far as possible internationalbuffer stocks might bo organised for primary productsso that the demand for these products may &quot;be maintainedwhen world demand temporarily slumps;    (b) that as faras possible expenditure on international projects for capital development -might &quot;be postponed in times of high world demand and concentrated in periods ofdeficient world demand;    and (c)  that the problem ofmaintaining world demand would be eased in so far as itis possible to make arrangements to lend,  in times of world depression,  rather more freely than otherwise would be the case to countries which were maintainingeffective domestic employment policies and were therebymaking a special contribution to the maintenance of theworld demand for internationally traded goods.      Thebrief accordingly suggests that the relevant international agencies,  such, as the International Monetary Fund, theInternational Bank end the International gradeOrganisation,  should be invited to consider whatcontribution they could make to the solution of these problems.6. We arc confident that Ministers will approve thepoints summarised in  (i)   and (ii) above.      On the pointssummarised in (iii),  however,  a question of tactics arises.It would have been possible in referring to action by international bodies (especially the Bonk end the Fund)  to go intodetail by specifying particular powers enjoyed by those &quot;bodiesunder the relevant agreements.      We feel,  however, that it wouldnot be wise to go further than is suggested in paragraph 5above in broaching these  questions at a Conference summoned to deal primarily with commercial problems,  and at whichthese infant international financial institutions,  though.represented by observers, night well be unprepared to engage in discussion of a detailed character.      (The Chancellorof the Slxchequer,  before leaving for Washington,   informed theTreasury that this was his view).
