(46) 358.October, 1946.CABINET.PALESTINE CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for the Colonies.I. Proceedings at the Conference.WE submit for the information of the Cabinet the following account of thediscussions at the Palestine Conference from the 9th September to the 2nd October.2. Invitations were issued on the Arab side to the States Members of theArab League, to Abdur Rahman Azzam Pasha, Secretary-General of the arab league, to the Palestine Arab Higher Executive and to certain representativeindividual Arabs in Palestine; and on the Jewish side to the Jewish Agency, tocertain other representative Jewish bodies in this country, to the Acting ChiefRabbi, and to a number of representative individual Jews in Palestine. the invitations were not accepted by any of the Jews or by the Palestine iVrabs.When, therefore, the Conference opened on the 9th September it was attendedonly by the British Delegation and by the delegates from the Arab States withAzzam Pasha as an adviser.3. At the outset of the Conference the British Delegation tabled theprovincial autonomy plan, as outlined in Parliament on the 31st July, and explained the considerations which had led His Majesty&apos;s Government to putforward this solution as a basis for discussion. The Arab Delegates at once made it clear that they were opposed to this plan in principle and could not accept it as a basis for discussion. They criticised many of its features; but it was clearthat, fundamentally, their rejection of this solution was based on their conviction that any scheme of provincial autonomy would inevitably lead to Partition. they believe that the creation of an autonomous Jewish province, with substantialpowers of control over immigration into its area, would fan the hopes of politicalZionism; and that Jewish immigrants would be admitted into this area in suchnumbers as to give the Jewish community a majority in the population ofPalestine as a whole. The criterion of &apos;&apos; economic absorptive capacity &apos;&apos; wouldnot in their view suffice to prevent this; for the Jews could establish an industrial and commercial economy which would permit of a far greater density of populationthan that of the Arab province. In a short space of time a situation would havebeen created in Palestine in which neither the Arabs nor His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment could resist the demand for the creation of an independent Jewish State.4. The Arab States are inflexibly opposed to the establishment of a JewishNational State in Palestine. They believe that this would be a bridgehead forJewish political and economic penetration, first into the rest of Palestine and thereafter into Transjordan, Syria and the whole Arab world. The Jews would,they think, fill their State with immigrants from Europe until they had createdconditions warranting a demand for more Lebensraum which would then be used as a means of progressive encroachment into the territories of the neighbouring-States.5. Even in the short term, they believe that the creation of an independentJewish State in Palestine would be a threat to the peace and security of the arab world. For Arab apprehensions about the ultimate consequences are so great that the Arabs of Palestine could not be restrained from adopting violent means to check Jewish expansion in its early stages before it became toe powerful for[32498]
them to combat.  And in this they would have the sympathy of all. and the active support of some, Governments of the Arab States.6. The British Delegation had at the outset stated that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were not finally committed to the provincial autonomy plan and were willing to consider any alternative proposals which might be put forward. Whenit became clear that the Arab Delegates were unanimous in their opposition to theprovincial plan and were unwilling to discuss it in detail, they were invited toexplain what alternative proposals they had for dealing with the problem. Theywere reminded that any practical solution must take account of the following factors in the situation : -&quot; (i) There is already in Palestine a highly organised population of 600,000Jews, who will insist on their political rights not only as individualsbut as a community.&quot; (ii) Although it is clear that Palestine cannot provide a complete solution for the problem of Jewish refugees, no settlement of the palestine problem which did not admit of further Jewish immigration could beregarded as acceptable.&quot; (iii) Palestine cannot remain indefinitely under tutelage, but must begin to make progress towards independence.&apos;&apos; (iv) Therefore institutions must be created which will enable both peoplesliving in Palestine to govern themselves to a steadily increasing extent.&quot; (v) The condition of tension in which the people of Palestine have livedfor the past ten years is no longer tolerable. It must be brought to anend, not only because it makes self-government impossible, but also because it menaces the peace of neighbouring countries.&quot;The Arab Delegates were asked to keep these points in mind in framingtheir alternative proposals.7. The proposals put forward by the Arab Delegates, in response to this invitation, envisaged the early independence of Palestine as a unitary State witha permanent Arab majority, under a democratic constitution including safe-guards for the Jewish minority. After some preliminary discussion the Con-ference appointed a Committee to examine these proposals in detail and to study the practical steps which would be required to give effect to the general principlesoutlined in the Arab plan. After discussion in Committee, during whichopportunity was taken to draw attention to some of the practical difficulties, a detailed Arab plan was formulated, the main features of which may be sum-marised as follows : (i) Palestine to be a unitary State with a permanent Arab majority andto attain independence as such after a short period of transition(two or three years) under British Mandate. It should have a democratic constitution with an elected legislature.(ii) Within this unitary State &quot; all the important sections of the citizenry &quot;to have civil rights and be adequately represented in the LegislativeAssembly, provided that the number of Jewish representatives shouldnot exceed one-third. (The Arab Delegations proposed a restrictivedefinition of &apos;&apos; citizen &apos;&apos; which would mean, in effect, that no Jewishimmigrant would be regarded as a citizen, either for purposes of voting or for purposes of calculating the number of Jewish seats inthe Legislative Assembly, until he had resided for ten years inPalestine.)(iii) The representation of the various communities in the Legislature tobe reflected in the Executive and the Administration.(iv) Safeguards to be provided to protect the sanctity of the Holy places and freedom of religious practice throughout Palestine,(v) Religious bodies or other societies and individuals to be free to maintainprivate schools and universities, subject to Government control andthe compulsory teaching of Arabic,(vi) Hebrew to be recognised as a second official language in districts whereJews form an absolute majority,(vii) Until otherwise provided by legislation enacted by the independentPalestine State, Jewish immigration to be entirely prohibited and theland transfer restrictions to remain unchanged. Legislation on thesetwo matters to require the consent of the majority of the Arabmembers of the Legislative Assembly.
(viii) Legislation modifying the safeguards guaranteeing the rights of Jewishcitizens to require the consent of the majority of the Jewish membersof the Legislative Assembly,(ix) Guarantees concerning the Holy Places to be embodied in a declaration made to the General Assembly of the United Nations, in which thePalestine State would bind itself not to modify those guarantees with-out the consent of the Assembly.8. The Arab Delegates proposed that these constitutional arrangements should be brought into effect by the following stages. First, the High Com-missioner would establish, by nomination, a provisional Government, consistingof 7 Arabs and 3 Jews, to which the administrative and legislative powers ofthe present administration would be transferred, the High Commissionerretaining a power of veto during the transition period. The provisionalGovernment would prepare and submit to a Constituent Assembly a draft con-stitution on the lines indicated above. This Assembly would consist of 60 elected members representing the various &apos;&apos; sections of the citizenry &quot; in accordance withtheir numbers. If the Assembly failed, within six months, to complete their task of drawing&apos; up a detailed constitution consistent with the general principlesoutlined above, the provisional Government would themselves enact the constitu-tion. When the constitution had been adopted, the provisional Government would hold Parliamentary elections. The Legislative Assembly would be elected andthe first Head of the independent State would be appointed. The Mandate wouldthen be terminated. A Treaty of alliance would, however, be concluded definingfuture relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the independentPalestine State; and the Arab Delegates assumed that this would secure suchmilitary facilities in Palestine as were desired by His Majesty&apos;s Government.It was contemplated that these processes should all be completed not later thanthe 31st December, 1948.9. By the time that these detailed proposals had been worked out and presented to the Conference, the informal discussions which had been proceeding with representatives of the Jewish Agency had reached a stage at which there seemed at last to be some prospect of bringing them into.the Conference. Forthis reason, and also because further time would have been required if the cabinet were to consider the Arab plan, it was thought necessary to adjourn the dis-cussions with the Arab Delegates. An interval of at least two weeks was required; but by then many of the Delegates to the Conference would be dueto leave London for the General Assembly of the United Nations, and it was found, after discussion, that the earliest practicable date on which the Con-ference could be resumed was 16th December. The discussions with the ArabDelegates have accordingly been adjourned until that date.II. Discussions with the Jews.10. Meanwhile, since the decision of the Jewish Agency Executive in Parison the 7th August to refuse the invitation conveyed to Dr. Weizmann on the2nd August to participate in the Conference, informal discussions had continuedintermittently with various representatives of the Agency on the question of participation. On the 15th August Dr. Weizmann, Rabbi Wise and Dr. Gold-man laid down the following conditions, which we found it impossible toaccept:  (i) that the basis of discussion should be the establishment of a viableJewish State in an adequate area of Palestine;(ii) that those members of the Executive who were detained or subject todetention should be permitted to form part of the Agency delegation to the Conference;(iii) that any invitation addressed to non-Agency Jewish representatives should be issued through the Agency.11. A series of discussions followed in Paris. On our side it was stressed that the Agency could bring forward at the Conference their Partition Plan orany other scheme they favoured and that their proposals would be fully con-sidered. We also agreed to meet the Agency&apos;s view to the extent of consultingthem about the non-Agency Jewish representatives to be invited. At one stagethey undertook to produce a list of Agency representatives, but later (the 29thAugust) decided to put forward an alternative proposal that the conference should be held in two phases, opening with discussions between His Majesty&apos;s
them to combat.  And in this they would have the sympathy of all, and the active support of some, Governments of the Arab States.6.

A series of discussions followed in Paris. On our side it was stressed that the Agency could bring forward at the Conference their Partition Plan orany other scheme they favoured and that their proposals would be fully con-sidered. We also agreed to meet the Agency&apos;s view to the extent of consultingthem about the non-Agency Jewish representatives to be invited. At one stagethey undertook to produce a list of Agency representatives, but later (the 29thAugust) decided to put forward an alternative proposal that the conference should be held in two phases, opening with discussions between His Majesty&apos;s
Government and the Arabs, the Jews being called in subsequently at an appro-priate moment, i.e., when the Arabs had begun to show willingness to discussPartition.12. We were unable to accept this alternative proposal, and on the4th September (the Conference being due to open on the 9th September) we found it necessary to inform the Agency that, as they had not replied to the invitation,His Majesty&apos;s Government had no alternative but to issue the invitations to otherJewish representatives. Those representatives felt unable, however, to join the )Conference at this stage in view of the Jewish Agency&apos;s attitude.13. On the 14th September Dr. Goldmann indicated the Agency&apos;s willing-ness to reopen the question of participation in the Conference and to submit alist of representatives. He provisionally agreed with us the terms of a draftcommunique stating that it had been arranged that delegates of the jewish agency and other Jewish representatives would begin to participate on the17th September. He was, however, unable to carry his colleagues with him, andthe list which was submitted on the 20th September again raised the question ofthe release of the detained members of the Agency Executive. We made it clearthat no bargaining was possible on this point.14. The final decision as to the Agency&apos;s participation rested with the inner Zionist Council in Jerusalem. On the 25th September the Council decidedthat the invitation to attend the Conference should be refused, but the executive of the Jewish Agency were empowered to continue their efforts to bring about&quot; preliminary conditions essential for the participation of the Jewish Agency inthe Conference.&quot;15. Dr. Weizmann&apos;s efforts had throughout been directed towards inducinghis colleagues to agree to join the Conference, and we understand that he didnot wish to insist on conditions. Faced with the Inner Zionist Council&apos;s decision,he had spoken of resigning from the Chairmanship of the Agency Executive, but after discussion with the Colonial secretary. he agreed to make one further effort to secure a change of attitude. At his request arrangements were made for mr. Kaplan (Treasurer of the Jewish Agency) and Rabbi Fishman to be flownfrom Jerusalem for consultation with him: but Mrs. Meyerson, the Acting Headof the Agency&apos;s Political Department, for whom he had also requested travel facilities, declined to accompany them. We had a long conversation withdraw. Weizmann and his colleagues (including the two representatives from palestine). on the 1st October. The Agency continued to press for the releaseof the detainees as a condition precedent to their joining the Conference. Wepointed out that the release of the detainees was bound up with the restorationof law and order in Palestine and that we were not prepared to deal with it inany other connection. It was therefore arranged that conversations should takeplace between the Colonial Secretary and the Agency to see whether the Agencywere prepared to take such action to remove tension in Palestine as would enable his Majesty&apos;s Government to consider the release of the detainees. conversations with this object were opened on the 4th October. The attitude of the jewish representatives at the first meeting indicated that there are many difficulties tobe overcome before a solution can be found, but a further meeting is to be heldon the 9th October.16. The present position is. therefore, that we cannot secure Jewishparticipation in the conference until an agreement has been reached about lawand order in Palestine which is sufficiently satisfactory to us to warrant therelease of the detained members of the Jewish Executive. If. however, such anagreement, can be reached, we shall be able to bring Jewish representatives intothe Conference on future policy in Palestine, and&quot; there is no reason whv thisshould be deferred until the Delegates of the Arab States return to London onthe 16th December.E. B.5th October. 1946.G. H.
