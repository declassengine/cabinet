THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 386.18th October, 1946.CABINET.PROPOSAL FOR A STUDY OF THE POSSIBILITIES OF CLOSEECONOMIC CO-OPERATION WITH OUR WESTERN EUROPEANNEIGHBOURS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to certain problems of economic relations between this country and Western Europe which call for earnestconsideration.2. We have generally subscribed, in our signature of the Anglo-UnitedStates Financial Agreement of the 6tJh December, 1945, to a policy designedto bring about the maximum possible expansion of world trade, based uponhigh and sustained levels of employment and consumption in every country.This policy, if it can be achieved, is in the best interests of the United kingdom as the world&apos;s principal trading nation, and further would promote political stability in all parts of the world.3. It is also our policy to prevent, if possible, the division of Europe andthe Middle East into exclusive economic blocs. But this policy is in danger.It will be seen more clearly after the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers,which is to consider the German problem in November, whether it will be possibleto maintain at least the semblance of European economic unity.4. Should this prove impossible, we must expect not only that the Easternhalf of Europe will be excluded altogether from the general free expansion oftrade, but also that the U.S.S.R. will seek to extend its political and economicinfluence into Western Europe. We shall prevent this only if we are prepared with measures which, involving close economic ties, would bind Western european countries politically more closely to ourselves. The basic need of such a Westernsolidarity would be firm economic ties between the United Kingdom and France,5. It is also conceivable that the United States sponsored plan for an expansion of multilateral trade will break down. In this event, too, we may need to strengthen our economic ties, not merely with the Commonwealth, butalso with Western Europe.6. Either of these eventualities might occur fairly suddenly, and at a timewhen we are still bound by our undertaking to the United States government under the Financial Agreement of December 1945, not to engage in commercialdiscrimination against United States supplies. This undertaking might rule out a gradual deepening of Anglo-European economic co-operation by ever-increasingmutual concessions, such as the scheme for an economic union by stages betweenBelgium and Holland put forward in 1932, which was frustrated &quot;by the insistenceof the United States and United Kingdom Governments on their &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; rights. If we are to strengthen our ties with Western Europe we maybe faced, therefore, with the necessity of taking a. single plunge into a fullcustoms union, which has always been exempted from the operation of the most-favoured-nations clause, and is expressly permitted under the United states proposals on commercial policy.7.   Such a step would need the most careful consideration.   It raises oreatpractical difficulties connected with the position of the Dominions, and the status of the respective colonial empires.   Moreover, for its successful working over13624   [32559]329
any length of time some measure of concerted industrial and commercial planningwith other members of the Union would be necessary. It would be impossible,without extensive preliminary study, to determine whether in fact, on balanceand in the circumstances envisaged, it would be economically of advantage tothe United Kingdom. If not, the economic disadvantages would have to be weighed against the political advantages.8.   I accordingly invite my colleagues to sanction, without prejudice to -any ultimate decision, the most complete possible study by the departmentsconcerned of the practicability and desirability of  (i) A full customs union.(ii) Some special economic regime, falling short of a full customs union,between: (a) The United Kingdom and Metropolitan France.(&amp;) The United Kingdom and the French Union.(c) The United Kingdom and Western Europe as a whole, includingthe Western Zones of Germany, as occasion offered.9. I recognise the difficulties that would be involved in any degree ofeconomic union between the United Kingdom and European countries which did not include colonial dependencies and, in our case, the Dominions as well.My colleagues may therefore feel that the proposed study should also look tothe possible inclusion in the customs union or special regime of colonial dependencies and the British Dominions, including Eire.10. Such an enquiry should take into account all relevant facts and circum-stances. These will include the prerequisites and implications of any such arrangement in regard to our relations, both commercial and political, with therest of the Commonwealth, and with foreign countries. It should also considerthe effect of such an arrangement on our capacity to implement our existing international obligations, and in particular our recent financial agreements with canada and the United States.11. As regards the United States proposals for an International trade organisation, the study I propose should examine the question on three alterna-tive assumptions : (a) That the proposals come into operation substantially throughout theWestern world.(b) That they come into partial operation.(c) That they fail to come into operation at all.12. The study would, of course, also have to cover the effects, favourableand unfavourable, of the customs or other economic union suggested, on our home economy. In fact, it would form a kind of balance sheet of the advantages and disadvantages, both domestic and external, of the measures suggested.13. I hope that my colleagues will see their way to agreeing that sucha study, which will clearly take time, should begin at the earliest possible date and should be pursued as a matter of urgency.E BForeign Office, S.W.1,18th October, 1946.
