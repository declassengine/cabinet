this document is the property op his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 398.24th October, 1946.CABINET.INTERNATIONAL  CONTROL  OF  THE  RUHR.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Recommendations.1. The principal industries in the area North Rhine-Westphalia shouldnot be transferred to Allied ownership but should be socialised.2. Trustees of German nationality should be appointed by the Land Govern-ment of North Rhine-Westphalia to take title of ownership of the propertiesconcerned under a provisional charter and hold such titles in trust for german public corporations. The latter would be established in consultation with the trustees as soon as the Land Government has been elected.3. The control should be exercised by the British Zone Commander untilthe general occupation of Germany is terminated. Representatives from theUnited States, France, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg, but not Russia, wouldbe associated with him as observers.4. The form of the international control, and particularly the question ofRussian participation after the period of the general occupation of Germany is over, will require further consideration later. We must not commit ourselves onthis point meanwhile.Memorandum.1. On the 17th April, 1946, the Cabinet considered a paper on the Futureof Germany and the Ruhr, which was circulated as CP. (46) 156, and a furtherpaper CP. (46) 139 on the Ruhr and Western Germany. These papers containedtwo alternative plans for the international control of the principal industries of the Ruhr. One proposal, known as the E.I.P.S. Plan, provided for economiccontrol being exercised through ownership or part ownership of a selected group&apos;of industrial companies. Ownership would be transferred to an InternationalHolding Corporation, voting control of which would be retained by the partici-pating Powers. The profits earned would be made available to the Germanpeople either through the new local authority covering the area or to theprovincial Government, or, if desired, to a central German Government. Thepowers of the Corporation would be defined in a charter from the GermanGovernment which would be the subject of agreement with the participatingPowers. The Corporation would possess no additional powers such as the rightto veto other legislation or compelling the German Government to pass newlaws. Any breach of the Charter would constitute a breach between the GermanGovernment and the participating Powers entitling the latter to impose sanctions.The Corporation would be directed by a Council of representatives ofeach participating Power, who would report direct to their Govern-ments and would have votes equivalent to the shareholding of their government. Ordinary decisions of the Corporation would be takenby a 51 per cent. vote. In cases where the question of the impositionof sanctions arose a 75 per cent.&apos; vote of the Council would constituteautomatic authority for the Commander-in-Chief of the occupying forces inthe area to take the necessary action. Provision would be made for the GermanGovernment to appeal to U.N.O., and to make the plan palatable to the Germans13637   [32595]
it was proposed that the control should be terminated at the end of a statedperiod of say 50 years, subject to the approval of the Security Council.2. The second proposal was on somewhat different lines. Instead of theindustries being owned internationally they would be made into a socialisedGerman Corporation, which would be set up by the Provincial Government ofthe area and whose relationship to that Government would be the same as thatof the National Coal Board in this country to His Majesty&apos;s Government.Germany&apos;s obligation in regard to the transferred industries would be laid downin such detail as necessary in the peace treaties, and an International control organisation would be formed to supervise the performance of these obligations.Thus political control, with, of course, the possibility of political and militarysanction, would be substituted for industrial control through ownership.3. When these two alternative proposals were considered by the Cabineton the 17th April opinion was divided as to which of the two plans was thepreferable. I was authorised, however, to discuss them both with the countriesprincipally concerned, and also to seek their approval for the establishment ofa new Province in this area.4. Since then both plans have been shown to the United States, French,Belgian and Dutch Governments, whose views may be summarised as follows : United States Government.5. We have received no official intimation of the United States Govern-menfs views on our plans for internationalisation of the Ruhr. Discussions withrepresentatives of the State Department in Paris last April suggested, however,that of the two plans they favoured socialisation rather than ownership of theindustries concerned. More recently Mr. Byrnes in his Stuttgart speech has suggested that the United States favour a, general control of industry in Germany.This accords with his proposal for a Four-Power Treaty to guarantee the demilitarisation of Germany. This is not irreconcilable with our own plans fora special and localised control in the Ruhr. Mr. Byrnes also announced in his speech that the United States were opposed to political separation of the Ruhr.French Government.6. Discussions in April with the French showed that they were not at that stage prepared to abandon their proposals for the political separation of the ruhr from the rest of Germany. Given political separation they felt that itwould be better to socialise the industries concerned rather than transfer themto international ownership, with the exception of coal. In the case of coalthey pointed out the vital importance to the French economy of continuing coal exports from the Ruhr, and felt that the only way to achieve this was by theinternational ownership and management of the mines.Belgian and Dutch Governments.7. Both of these Governments are opposed to political separation andfavoursocialisation rather than international ownership.8. All of the above countries were in favour of the establishment of a newProvince whose boundaries would include the important industries of the Ruhrvalley and the surrounding neighbourhood and accordingly in 1946 a new LandNorth Rhine-Westphalia was established by the British&apos; Commander-in-Chief.9. The question of international control of the Ruhr is bound to arise inthe course of the forthcoming discussions of the Council of Foreign Ministers onthe fusion of Germany, and I feel that by then we should be prepared to come outwith definite proposals of our own.10. The points on whidh a decision must therefore be reached are asfollows :---(1) Whether the industries of the Ruhr should be transferred to internationalownership or socialised.(2) If socialised, should the Corporation formed to acquire the properties ofthe industries concerned be set up by the Government of the LandNorth Rhine-Westphalia or by a Central German Government.(3) When the international control should be established and which powers should participate.
International Ownership or Socialisation.12. I have come to the conclusion that we should abandon our first plan for international ownership and come firmly out with a proposal for spcialisartion. We have always recognised that under international ownership it would be politically undesirable and financially impracticable for Germany to be forcedto remit the earnings of the industries in foreign exchange to foreign owners, andit was for this reason that under the plan for international ownership provision was made for the retention of the profits by Germany. Ownership deprived ofthe right to receive profits is an unreal conception. It would involve us in allthe responsibility for determining the policy on which the industries must be operated without any of the advantages. It would also inevitably extend thepurposes which we have in mind for the establishment of international controlso as to include commercial as well as security considerations. It is most improbable that the commercial interests of the participating Powers can remainidentical for long and once differences of opinion arose between them on com-mercial grounds Germany would be quick to take advantage of this and byplaying one off against&apos; the other would inevitably weaken our security hold.Socialisation of the basic industries is strongly supported by the majority of germans, particularly by the S.P.D. International ownership would be stronglyresented by all Germans.Should the Government of Land North Rhine-W estphalia or an eventual central german Government be responsible for setting up the Socialised Corpora-tton to which the Ruhr industries concerned would be transferred f13. This question has recently been under consideration by the british element of the Control Commission. They advocate that in the case of coal,iron and steel, there is a strong case for their assets being transferred to Corpora-tions which would be established by a Central German Government. these industries are basic to German economic life as a whole and the branches of them which exist in other zones should also, in their opinion, be brought into public ownership. Moreover, they contend that the financial complications involved,not only in compensating owners for property acquired but also in financingdeficits in times of depression and finding new money for investment, would prove beyond the capacity of the Land Government. These arguments deserveconsideration. On the other hand, there is no Central Government for the timebeing and in the state of our present relations with Russia it is impossible to saywhen, if at all, a Government with jurisdicton over the whole of the fouroccupied zones will be established. A Central Government with control over the ruhr, which fell under Russian domination, would be a most serious threat toour security. Moreover, the establishment of the Corporations by a CentralGovernment must obviously be less conducive to security than their establishmentby the Government of the Land under permanent military occupation which couldbe temporarily excluded from the jurisdiction of German Government and operated by the Allies in the event of any major breach of the treaty occurring.The French, who favour the maximum degree of decentralisation, would certainlytake this view, and I myself am not prepared to accept the recommendation ofthe British Element, at any rate at this stage.14. The solution to this problem which I recommend is that we should notat this stage create public Corporations for the coal, iron and steel industries,but vest the properties concerned in the hands of trustees of German nationalityappointed by the Land Government of North Rhine-Westphalia, under a provis-ional charter and obliged to hold such titles in trust for the future german public Corporations and on behalf of the German people. After the election ofa Land Government in the spring, it would consult with the Trustees and british authorities with a view to setting up Corporations as soon as possible. Thiswould put an end to the uncertainty which at present exists as to whether theseproperties should be regarded as German or foreign owned. If at a later datetile Land Government proved incapable of discharging its responsibilities, furtherconsideration could be given to the alternative of transfer to a Central Govern-ment and to the possibility of devising adequate safeguards.11.   My own views on these questions are as follows : 
The Date of Establishment of an International Control and its Composition.15. So long as the occupation of the whole of Germany continues, controlover the Ruhr industries should be exercised by the British Zone Commander.Representatives from the United States, France, Holland, Belgium and luxembourg -bourg could be associated with him as observers. As regards Russia I am notprepared to admit any participation in the Ruhr except in return for somecomparable concession.E. B.Foreign Office, 24th October, 1946.
