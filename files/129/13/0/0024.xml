(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF&apos; HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S   GOVERNMENT)SECRETINTERNATIONAL COMMODITY policy memorandum by the president of the Board of Tradeand the Minister of food we recommend that the United Kingdom delegations to the Preparatory Committee on Trade and employment and to the F.A.O. Preparatory Commission should supportmeasures for developing the production and distributionof foodstuffs so as to raise health standards throughoutthe world and the principle of buffer stocks and otherdevices for sound international commodity managementdesigned to achieve greater stability in the prices of primary products.2. However,  in view of the fundamental differences in physical character and the production pattern of eachcommodity,  we do not think that the U.K.   should be committed to support any comprehensive plan which wouldgive an international authority powers to establish actualcommodity schemes without reference to the participating countries.      We are satisfied that each commodity must betaken on its merits and this should be the qualification of our general support of what is, prime facie,  the correct method of approach.3. We are strengthened in this conclusion by twogeneral considerations(a) By this method of procedure it should be possibleto form a fairly accurate idea in each case ofthe financial commitments in. which the U.K.would be involved,  so that we should be freewhen the time comes to decide whether we are able to undertake such commitments in thelight&quot;of our then prevailing financial andforeign exchaiage position.CJ?^h l37h1 1TH OCTOBER,   1 9^-6COPY NO.CABINET

L9(b), The only commodity of which there is at present on cmb arms singly large surplus is wool,  endhere the surplus is firmly held on linoswhich have many of the characteristics of abuffer stock,  though the holding organisationconsists only of the United Kingdom, .,ustr-li:New He eland end South ...fries.      Many foodstuffswill continue in short supply for some time tocome and the problem of burdensome surplusesis hardly likely to arise in the near futureexcept for a handful of commodities.      thus the specific approach suggested above would allow for those commodities to bo given the separate Careful consideration required,including the vital point of the correct timing of the opening operations by any buffer stocksauthority.      We must not,  however,  lose sight of* the probability that producing interests inthe world will press for some form of international action Ion,;&apos; before surpluses become actual.h. We therefore recommend that the following principlesbe approved ..s the directive to the U. K.  representatives forthe JLT. 0.

&apos;     ANNEX &apos;*Brief for the U. E.__Delegations to the Preparatory Trr.deCommittee and the E.0.__Preparatory Commi ssion *^ -    introduction. In the course of October and November two sets    ofinternational discussions will be talcing place on commodity policy.      During October and the&apos;first part of November,preliminary discussions are to take place in London,   first with representatives of the Dominions,  and later withrepresentatives of the wider group of countries which constitute the preparatory Committee set up by the Economic  and social council to prepare for the proposed International Conferenceon Trade and Employment..     At the end of October,  discussionswill start in Washington at the preparatory Commission v/hichthe Pood end Agriculture Organisation has set up to discussproposals for a World Pood Board.      In both these discussions,Commodity Policy will play a -prominent part.      It is necessary ifor the United Kingdom Delegates to both those conferences tohave a comprehensive and consistent set of instructions covering the whole field of Commodity Policy.2. It will also be necessary for the United KingdomDelegations at both of these conferences to be in a positionto set Commodity policy against the general background ofH. M. G.&apos;s international economic riolicy.      The approach to the commodity problem,  as outlined in Chapter V&quot; of the American&quot;Proposals for Consideration by an International Conferenceon Trade and Employment&quot;  (Cmdy 67,0.9)  is useful in emphasisinga number of safeguards v/hich are vital to this country,  butit is generally negative in tone.      On the ether hand,  thePood and Agriculture Organisation proposals for a World PoodBoard in their original form, while positive in tone,  becomeextravagant and vague as expounded by some of their more extremeproponents.      It should accordingly be the. role of the UnitedKingdom Delegations to seek a severely practical,  -positiveand constructive middle way.3.&apos; The policy of achieving stability of economic conditions for.agricultural producers is a particular aspect of the general problem of maintaining world full employment,  r. high and stable level of world demand for all goods and    services,  and themaximum consumption of foodstuffs.      Experience has shown thatan important reason for slumps in the markets    for primary products is the reduced level of demand for raw materials andfoodstuffs on the part of the highly industrialisod countries of the world, which results from general economic depressions.The view might accordingly be expressed that H.M. G.   considers the general problem of devising an effective    and practicalinternational policy for full employment as a fundamental task,  whichis a basic requirement for a lasting solution of the particular problem of stabilising the markets for the products of 1agriculture.A. The general features of such an international employment policy are developed in some detail in a brief on this subjectpreoarcd by the Economic Section and agreed.by the Treasury raidthe Bo-^rd of Trade.      Reference is made to this brief in a noteby the Lord President of the Council  (CP. (1+6)364).      The briefis attached to this, note for reference (Appendix l).      Generally

spooking,   it is suggested    that grpat emphases shouldbe laid upon obtaining an unambiguous recognition onthe part of the main trading countries of theirinternational responsibility in applying effective domesticpolicies for the maintenance of a high and stable level of demand.      If domestic slumps in demand couldbe avoided in the main industrialised countries,  theproblem of acute world depression would not arise.     TheUnited Kingdom delegates might lay considerable stress on the contribution which this country hopes to makeby developing effective domestic measures for themaintenance of a high and stable level of demand.Following the United States trade proposals,  it issuggested that Governments should undertake to participate in arrangements under the sponsorship of the Economicend Social Council for the collection,  analysis and exchange of information on domestic employment problems,trends and policies.5. It is also-suggested in the brief on InternationalEmployment Policy that,   in addition to national policies,ther^ are certain possibilities for international actionto maintain world demand.      For example,  (i) expenditureon international projects for capital development might,as far as possible,  be postponed in times of high world demand and concentrated in periods of deficient world demand;    (ii)  in times of world depression internationalloans might be made rather more freely than would otherwise be the case to countries which were maintainingeffective domestic employment policies,  and were therebymaking a special contribution to the maintenance of world demand for internationally traded goods;    and (iii)  asfar as possible,   international buffer stocks might be organised for primary products so that  the demand forthese products might be maintained when world demandtemporarily slumped.6. It is in this context that the United KingdomDelegations might set the -possibility of more direct action t    stabilise the demand for primary productsthrough such mechanisms as buffer stocks and long-term contracts.       It should be urguod that such mechanismshave a double role to play,  first in making an important contribution to the general problem of stabilising world demand and secondly,  in helping to deal with some special problems connected with the markets for particular commodities.7. Both these points are of importance.      It wouldbe foolish to claim that the stabilisation of the demandfor primary products would be sufficient in itself to stabilise  the general level of world demand for all goods and services.      But in the world as a whole,  the incomes of the producers of primary products mai^e up a largepert of total World purchasing power;    and any actionwhich help6 to stabilise the purchasing power of the producers of such products will thus make a substantial contribution to an effective amid comprehensive internationalpolicy for full employment.      Secondly,  however,  evenIf a high end stable level of general world demand couldbe maintained.,  particular commodities will remain subjectto particular factors (such as a variation in erop yields)which may cause serious fluctuations in prices endproducers&apos;  incomes in the absence of special stabilisingdevices. r,-5-

8. Those policies take account of the views previouslyexpressed on behalf of H. IT.  Government at Hot Springs,  atthe cotton talks some months ago and,  more recently,  atCopenhagen.3.    The Problem of International Commodity ihmiagoment9. In the past producers and consumers of primary products,  both of agricultural and non-agricultural origin,have suffered from persistent and extreme fluctuationsof prices which introduced great uncertainty into their operations.-    These fluctuations in prices have tended to be far more violent than the basic facts of the supplyand demand situation would require.      It is possible to distinguish three kinds of price instability  j-(a) Cyclical fluctuations arising from the declinein demand in periods of -industrial depression,coupled with the inherent difficulty ofcurtailing output in the extractive industries&apos;and in agriculture where the efforts of the primary producer to maintain his money income in the face of falling prices frequentlycaused him to expand rather than contract hisoutput.     eg. though these low prices easedto some extent and for a time the difficultiesof importing countries such as the U. K. ,   theeffects on producing countries were oftendisastrous.      There is good ground for thinkingalso that the slump in prices of primary productswas an important factor in generating depressions;it certainly accentuated them when they had begun because of the difficulty of adjustingmanufacturing production to  the loss in demand from the primary producing countries.      It isclearly in the interests of the United Kingdom,both as an importing and a manufacturing country,and of producing countries,  to minimise thecyclical fluctuations of price.(b) Short term oscillations in prices due frequentlyto no defined or rational cause other themspeculative activity.      in the case ofwheat,  for example,  the average excess of the&apos;highest price of the year over the lowest pricewas no less than /0;.&apos; during the decade before1938  (RP(H3)12 Appendix l).      The moderationof these unnecessary fluctuations in. price would clearly be of advantage to producer    and consumer.

&apos; (c) Other fluctuations chje to r. Sequence of goodor bad &quot;harvests^  chances in taste and otherlonger terra factors.      The  treatment of thosefluctuations must depend upon their root cause.In the case of certain products,   such as rubber,there v/as a chronic  tendency to produce morethan could be sold at profitable prices,  evenaveraging periods of good and bad trade.      this tendency,  combined with the tendency of surplusesto develop during depressions,  led to theadoption of commodity regulation by means of restricting the output of all participating countries on a. pro rats basis,  irrespective oftheir relative efficiencies.      It cannot be-in the interests either of the IT. a.   or of theworld as a. whole to freeze an existing pattern of production irreopeetive of costs andpermanently to maintain uneconomic capacitythrough organised, restriction schemes.10. The problem may,  therefore,, be summarised thus;-(a) How to secure reasonable stability of priceagainst both short period and cyclical -and otherfluctuations;(b) How to secure the progressive adjustment ofproduction so that the world can benefit fromimprovements in technique and avoid any permanent tendency to use resources in uneconomicways.C.  Objectives of United Kingdom Policy11. Any u. K.  policy must be based upon the unchangingconsideration that this country is essentially an importerof foodstuffs and industrial raw materials,  and the primaryobjective- of our commodity policy as a consuming country must be to secure an assured flow of supplies of primary products at reasonable prices.      Only in this way can the food policy of the Government be implemented.12. But the United Kingdom,  while needing cheap supplies,does not benefit either from wide and unpredictable pricefluctuations or from severe deflationary downward swingsof price counter-balanced by largo upward swings at other times.      Producing countries, while they will benefit equallyfrom price stability,  will  tend    to prefer higher prices and to be driven,   therefore,   to restriction schemes whichperpetuate a pattern of world production which does not sufficiently reflect the differences .between high rand lowcost sources of supply.      The United Kingdom&apos;s interestdemands that    price stabilisation schemes must be sued asto favour the shift of production from high cost to lowcost sources,  though, it is recognised that this must be gradual if producing countries are to be induced toparticipate&apos;because of the   undoubted difficulty of finding alternative sources of employment and income,especially in agriculture.

ft13. The simplest desiderata of commodity regulationfrom a United Kingdom standpoint may,   therefore,  besummarised as follows  j-(a) assured supplies at reasonable prices;(b) The limitation of price instability;(c) Provision for the&quot;&quot;;-radual shift of production from high cost to low cost sources of supply.1h. It should be&apos;emphasised that these desiderata donot conflict with the vita]  ILK.   interest in the prosperity of the producers in the Colonial Empire.      The policiesoutlined below appear to accord fully with the proposals made recently by the   Colonial Secretary for bringingstability into the    incomes of Colonial producers,  proposals with which the Board of Trade,   the Treasury and    the Ministryof Food have expressed their agreement.D.    Devices to Achieve the Objectives15. There arc some five methods which can be usedseparately or in concert to rchieve the foregoingobjectives of international commodity management.      They are;-(a) Buffer stocks;(b) long term contracts;(c) Restriction schemes;(d) Ad hoc notion;(e) Special price systems.Each of those devices is discussed in the following paragraphs,(a) Buffer Stocks16. a Buffer Stocks arrangement could take two formss-(i)  international Buffer Stocks involving theestablishment^ of an international Authority with provisionfor the necessary funds.      The Authority would undertaketo buy the commodity in question freely at some pro-determinedlov/or price limit and soil freely at an upper price limit.If the basic price was chosen at a level which would&apos;equateproduction and   consumption over the long period,  the authority would ensure the maintenance of the price within the pre-determined range by acting as a reservoir.      The authority would own stocks in a number of countries and   conduct itsbuying, holding and selling operations&apos; through whateverchannels it   found most convenient and economical.(ii) a. Federation of national Buffer Stocks Authorities,under which individual- (governments would buy,  sell and holdstocks in conformity with the policy laid down by an international authority.      The actual stocks   would be owned by theindividual Governments themselves.      A suggested set of broadrules for such a Federation is contained in Appendix II.

17. Those two types of arrangements differ materially.An International Buffer Stock .authority would normallyconduct its buying and selling operations at the limits of the agreed price range, although in certain circumstancessuch as to forestall speculation it might operate withinthe range.      The Federation would instruct individualGovernments to alter the   levels of their stocks of the commodities with the    objective of holding internationalprices within&apos;a pro-determined range but those governments would be free to purchase or sell their stocks in whateverway and at whatever prices they decided themselves,subject to other general obligations on commercial policy.It would have to be agreed that,  in the eventof war,     such food would be available to us as a strategic reserve.      v/c should to some extent be bound by decisionsof the tauthority and not free to use our own jiidgrnent,but this is inherent in any Buffer Stocks scheme.&quot;V/o should have to consider how such a plan would    fit in with our longer term contracts,   sugar preferences,  etc..18.. The problem, of management,  given the existenceof national price support policies of different kinds,might be easier with a Federation than with aninternational authority.      The main disadvantage of&quot;national&quot; buffer stock schemes,  on the other hand,is that in the case of some commodities,   at any rate,     itwould be difficult to make sure that all members would keep to the rules.      Some Governments would be unable tokeep reliable statistics;    others might cook the statisticsto suit their ends.      The matter needs further detailed study,  individual commodities being examined separately.19.. arguments can be brought forward in support of either method,  but from the financial standpoint the Treasurythinks that a Federation&apos;of national Buffer&apos;&quot; Stocks authorities is likely in practice to be preferable to a plan under which governments have to subscribe large summon for purchases byan international Authority,20. If,  in the event,   the   weight of the preparatoryCommission wore to fall in favour of the internationalBuffer Stocks Authority,  it would bo for decision whether the prospective foreign exchange liabilityjustifies the advantages gained from the Buffer Stocksdevice.      In this connection it is to be emphasised that a Buffer Stocks scheme might in some cases unableus to resist arrangements for gur-.ntita.tive restrictions whichmaintained the prices of our    imports more or   less permanentlyat excessive prices...21. The financial problem for this country is real.The F.A.0.  Standing advisory Committee on Economics and marketing made an estimate of  300 million or $2 billionas the capital fund required to handle &quot;five staple foodstuffs&quot;.This seems to be a reasonable estimate.      The annual costof storage of a number of primary oroducts may be put at10ra although this figure needs careful investigation.The Committee also suggested that in framing the   contributions of individual Governments weight should be given to the volumuof oxnorts, volume of imports and production with thegreatest weight on exports,  since  the direct benefit fromstabilising Prices oflhrimary products    oes mainly to-producers.&apos;&apos; &quot;Talcing a  250 million fund for five cereals(wheat,  oats, barley, maize and   rice)  and   sugar alone,the    U.X.   share is estimated at  25 millions if exportscount twice as much as imports.      The U.K.   share of a 500 million fund co-roering a wider range of commoditieswould, of course, be much larger.-9-

22. The Treasury consider th: t neither the international bank nor   the &quot;International Monetary Fund con urov/ido thefinance.      The Treasury do not believe that commercial bankswould do so without guarantee  from Governments sincebuffer stocks are illiquid.   &apos; Commercial lending on goodsis on the basis    that the lender has the option Of callingin the loan every three months and can sell the goods freelyin the.event of default.      The Treasury therefore agreewith, the i1..... 0.   Committee    that  the principal contributions will have to come    from or be guaranteed by Governments.It should bo noted that subscriptions or guarantees bythe TJ.K.  would require legislation which is likely  to be controversial.23. Contributions   will have to be paid or guaranteedloans issued to a large extent in freely convertible currencies -in effect in U. 3.  dollars, which in the case of wheat and maize will be required in&apos;the main to buy Canadian dollarsand argentine pesos.      Buffer stocks    of raw materialssuch as metals and rubber could be financed in sterling toa much larger extent than buffer stocks of foodstuffs.2k. For importing countries,   foreign exchange problems would be involved and provision would have to be made to ensurethat buffer stocks operations alleviated rather than aggravatedbalance of payments    difficulties.25. Whatever form of arrangement is adopted the basic price is  the crucial problem which would face any Buffer Stockauthority.    In the long run the correct pirice in theeconomic sense is that which will equate supply and demand,and a basic price which did not do this would    result in either the gradual swamping of the buffer stock or in the exhaustion of its supplies.      A buffer stock scheme whichis not to degenerate into a permanent restriction scheme must,   therefore,  have, the power and be prepared to reduce the basic price from time to time,  in order to keep the stockat a manageable size and  to exercise gradual pressure upon producers 00 tin t the less efficient of them will be compelled to seek some alternative type of production.This can,  in appropriate cases,  be-secured by some arrangement for the reduction of the   basic price both when stocks exceeda -ore-determined amount and   when it has been foud that the organised restriction of production is necessary.26. It must be emphasised that a buffer stock scheme by itself could only be applied to r. limited range of primary products,  if only &quot;because of physical factors,and that the    coot of operating a scheme would rapidlybecome prohibitive in cases where special storage accommodation,etc.  was needed,   e. g. perishable foodstuffs.27. There are also other difficulties to be faced,for example,  the    stabilisation of the price of cerealsmight increase the instability of returns to producers of livestock products in certain countries unless other action was taken at the same time to steady the prices of these latter commodities (e. g.  lone; term contracts for meat, butter and cheese).      account must also be taken,   therefore,  of theinter-relrtionship between different commodities and wemust be prepared to buttress the buffer stocks scheme withother devices for commodity management.

28. jr. further problem crises from a possible confusionbetween the objectives of stabilising: producers&apos;  prices and stab iii sin;- producers&apos;  incomes.      Since certain agricultural products are subject to instability from the supply side(e.g.  weather conditions in the case of cereals&apos;) price stability in the    form of a fixed price might tend tode-stabilisc producers-&apos;   incomes.      This difficulty can be overcome, however,    by ensuring a -reasonably wide marginbetween the upper and lower limits of the buffor stocks pricerange,  an arrangement which is also desirable for a numberof other reasons.      Fluctuations in supplies could thenexpress themselves in fluctuations within the agreed pricerange,   thus imparting a fair degree of stability to producers&apos;   incomes.29. dbove all, national action in the commodity fieldmust be such as to support buffer stock  schemes.,  or must atany rate be subject to ouch degree of restraint by agreement as will prevent the schemes from being frustrated..     It is,therefore,  a necessary condition of the successful operati on of international buffer stocks that national measures suchas subsidies,  tariffs and quotas on the products concerned should be limited either by general conventions such as that proposed for the I.T.O.   or by ad hoc agreements;30. For these reasons buffer stock regulation cannot be-more than one particularly useful weapon in dealing withthe general problems of economic instability,  nor Is itcapable of application to more than a limited number of primary products,  each of which will present its own special problems which must bo dealt with case by case.       However,in conjunction with other measures,  the device of buffer stocksis worthy of support as a powerful instrument of commodity policy.(b) Long Term Contracts31. The device of a long term contract,   although afamiliar one in private business,   had not boon developed as an intergovernmental instrument before the Ministry ofFood contracts with the Southern Dominions for livestock products were- concluded in 19UU.      Since that date theMinistry of Food has mr.de many long term contracts for imported foodstuffs and at present more than h-OVj of its current food, import programme is covered by such contracts.The long term contract is an &quot;ttractive device to  the producer of primary products,  since it gives him-a largedegree of certainty in his operations,   both as  to salesand as to price.      It has also many advantages for importing countries.       Indeed,  although in the same way as Buffer Stocksit may involve foreign exchange difficulties,  a long term contract would only become disadvantageous if it werenegotiated on a non- commor c i r. 1 basis ( i. e.   if political factorswere allowed to intervene in  the    form of the    contract) orin a very unstable world.   - However,  given other international action to bring greater stability into world prices -and givenexoort negotiation on a commercial basis,   the long term contract lias   groat value as a stabilising factor,  especiallyin the case of perishable commodities which do not lend themselvesto other arrangements.

32. It will be clear that buffer stock schemes,  depending^ as they do on control  through price, will only operate effectively in the case of commodities which arc fundamentallyin reasonably good balance.      past experience has shown,however,  that situations arise from time to time in whichthere is more capacity available  than the world can absorb,even at prices ruinous to producers;    and although themaintenance throughout the    world of a high level ofemployment would reduce the number of such cases it is unlikely that it would eliminate them.      Where primaryproducing countries have attempted to stabilise anyparticular products,  the problem of alternative employment for their producers is one of extreme difficulty,  and somecushioning of price reductions is essential during a periodlong enough to allow for the necessary adjustments.      Insuch situations,   and possibly also during severe slumps,a Buffer Stock Authority would be overwhelmed by offerswhich could not be checked by any price reductions whichwould not ruin producers completely.       It would,   therefore,be necessary to introduce temporary measures for therestriction of exports and fee exporting countries to take similar measures to limit their production.      The dangerof such restriction schemes is that there will be pressure in the future,  as    there has been in the past,   to use themto preserve a world pattern of eroduction under which high cost producers would permanently retain their share of world    trade by the maintenance of measures which would prevent expansion by low cost producers and the much desiredre-oriontation of -production would be postponed.33. Chapter V of the I. T.O.  proposals provides manysafeguards against restriction schemes of the pre-war type,and lays down exacting conditions which must be satisfiedbefore&apos; any restriction can be immosed.      These proposalsdo not contemplate the establishment of buffer stocks and in.cases where these were in existence it would be clearly desirable that the Authority should have powers to introducesafeguards such as the possible right  to restrict exports,whenever the buffer stock was approaching its maximum holding.It is suggested that the U.K.  representatives at the I.T. 0..Conference should be instructed that where a Buffer Stockauthority is operating,   it should be empowered to introduce such safeguards as export restrictions more promptly thanat present laid down,  subject to the automatic provision forprogressive price adjustments during the currency of restriction.3h* Prom the U.K.  point of view,   the essential safeguardfor restriction schemes is the requirement that the basic price should be gradually reduced over the whole period during which restriction is in oper:tion,  except to theextent necessary to preserve some moderate reserve of capacity.

Ad Hoc action35.    Much can ho achieve;! by national action and by limitedinternational action to reinforce other measures designed bo reducethe instability in the orice of primary products.    For example,   *in the inter-war period relatively small surplus offers of commodities such as meat and butter wore known to have broughtabout disproportionate declines In prices in the  short term. -These price declines might well have boon avoided by some  under-standing between, say, the U.K. and Australia  jointly to arrange the carrying of the small surpluses until world conditions were more settled.    Moreover, concerted national action to carry largerstocks of certain commodities at critical points of time mightbe of great value.    In the past the great difficulty in overcoming the downward course of price has been general destocking by firms or individuals which accelerated the fall in prices and thusperversely justified the action,    dh understanding among exportingand importing countries to carry temporarily enlarged stocks at certain times might well be  of great value in preventing unwarrantedestocking of primary products, ana, possbily, also of preventingunnecessary stocking up during periods of rising prices.    Theexistence of some form of international commodity organisation,such as that envisaged in the I.T.O.  document, at which nationscould exchange views on tendencies in world prices would clearly be of great value in encouraging action in the national field to reinforce other stabilising measures,( e) Advancement of Less-Developed ia-ees and SpecialPrice Systems36.    One solution of the problem of raising nutritional standards in less-developed areas lies in measures to increase their outputof agricultural and industrial goods by improved productionmethods.    This is a method v/hich should be advantageous to producers and consumers alike and should receive the fullestsupport of the U.K. Delegation,    iis far as this country isconcerned, the development of additional exportable production inthe less-developed areas would probably mean increased supplies from countries  outside the dollar area and would thus incidentallybe of great service  in economising our dollar resources.37.    In the F.x&apos;, .0. Proposals,  however,  the advancement of less developed areas is linked with a scheme for the accumulation ofspecial reserves of foodstuffs which some into surplus supply andtheir distribution on special terms to needy nations or groups.These proposals will undoubtedly be most attractive to many countries which will participate in the meeting of the PreparatoryCommission at Washington - both to producing countries who^foreseesurpluses unsaleable at what they regard as fair prices and to countries who expect that they might become recipients of food-stuffs  on special terms.-38.     There is, however, a danger for this country in such two-price systems.    Under such systems  it is probable&apos; that the cost of selling the commodity on specially cheap terms to certainconsumers will be met by charging a higher price than would otherwise be the case to the other consumers.    Such systems mighttend to become a;permanent for.m of relief to needy countries,financed by the less needy consuming countries/  It is one matter

to decide that there should he some form of international reliefwhereby the richer countries (whether importers or exporters pithe roods in question)  subsidise the supplies of certainnecessities to the needy countries.    It is quite anotner matter to tax the less needy importers of a particular comrnouity inorder to raise funds for the relief of the more needy importers.39.    The U.K. Delegation should take the line that two-pricesystems, where administratively practicable,  should be strictlyconfined*to the temporary emergency task of getting rid ofparticular surpluses.    They should, accordingly, be. subject tothe safeguard that, as long as they persisted, there would be a gradual downward movement of the higher of tho two prices.E. International Tralo 0ngaiiisatjopr^ProIk^lgticanh-0.    The existing proposals for inter-Governmental commodityregulation schemes confine themselves to restriction ofproduction and the safeguards which should govern the establish-ment of restriction schemes.    These are,  of course, .,msricanproposals and while we have expressed general agreement withthem, we are not excluded from sxiggesting amendments or additions.In our opinion it is now necessary that the existing proposalsfor commodity regulation should bo revised, in particular to make provision for the establishment of buffer stock schemes,  since we are satisfied by our examination of buffer stock regulationthat this represents a valuable approach to the problems of price stabilisation.P. Organisationi+1.    dt a later stage in the work of the Commission, the questionof the nature of tho international machinery to carry out the agreed objectives will arise.    There are such obvious advantages in ensuring that,  in the sphere of policy as opposed to operation,all commodity problems are dealt with by one single international organisation that we should make our position on this point clearbeyond doubt.    The disadvantages of separate organisations  to conduct commodity policy for foodstuffs or agricultural products from the organisation dealing with industrial raw materials areclear.    There will be a number of primary commodities whose specialcircumstances will require special treatment under the proposedTrade Convention.    Such special treatment must be directed by oneorganisation.    Moreover, in our view a positive commodity policyIs an important device for maintaining world demand at a highand stable level and it would be wrong to treat foodstuffs oragricultural products separately from other primary products.    Inaddition,  in order to avoid duplication and over-lap,  it is desirablethat the Commodity Commission of tho proposed International trade organisation should be the international&apos; organisation concerned.But in order to-avoid delay in the initiation of the  type ofcommodity policy proposed in this memorandum,  the U.K. Delegation &apos;should be ready to propose the immediate creation of a temporaryCommodity Commission covering all commodities, which should mergeinto the proposed I.T.O.  at a  later date.h2.   As a further means of hastening action, the U.K. delegation should express, its full approval of confining- the discussion attne Preparatory Commission to agricultural products or,  if necessary,to essential foodstuffs only, although the latter course would notbe palatable to the United States in view of their interest inc ott on.

Draft Brief for the forthcoming International discussions on*INT EBBAfIOBAL EMPLOYMENT policy.      The peseonsibilitios of National Governmenfe1.      It is now generally agree6* that the essential feature of a successful policy for full employment is the adoptionof effective measures to maintain the general level of demand for goods and services at a high and stable level.Much thought has been given in recent years to the sort of measures which might be taken by national governments to,maintain the general level of demand within their ownterritories.      Such measures fall in the main into thefollowing three  categories;-(a) The planning ana timing of the demand for goods and services By public authorities.      Inparticular, in this connection, attention hasbeen given to the control of public investment,that is to say, of expenditure By public authorities on all forms of capital development,(b) The use of taxes and subsidies in such a way asto vary the total purchasing power at thedisposal of the individual members of thecommunity, or to vary the financial incentive to spend money on goods and services of allkinds.(c) The control of cried it through monetary policy,devised to make supplies of money&apos;more plentiful mine the terms of borrowing easierduring those periods when it is desired to stimulate expenditure.2*      The success or failure of a particular national government (rend in particular the government of a rich andhighly developed country whose demand for goods and servicesexercises a large influence in &apos; world markets). in maintainingits domestic demand at a high and stable level, Is a matterof keen interest to the other nations of the world.      It a domestic slump in demand of any magnitude develops in such a country, its demand for imports will fall off.      Moreover,the decline In its money prices and costs which willprobably accompany such a slump will cause its exports to compete On cheaper terms with the goods of other countries.Other countries will thus fine that the demand for their exports declines and that,  in the absence of special measures,their domestic industries have to face increased competition from cheaper imports.      To some extent, these adverse effectsmay be offset by the advantage which the outside world willreap in having to pay less for its imports from the country which is the focus of depression,      Nevertheless, on balance,depression and unemployment in one country tends to give riseto depression and unemployment in oth r countries.Unemployment which is  &apos;imported1 in this way, i,s. whichoriginates in a decline of demand abroad, is oftenparticularly difficult to offset by domestic measures, partly because it is d ifficu.lt to predict and forestall, and partly

&quot;because it may affect in the first instance export industries for which it is not easy to arrange an adoquote alternativeoutlet on the home marketi,      Much will depend on thecharacter of the particular industries affected, &quot;but ingeneral it may &quot;be said that while it may &quot;bo possible toprevent the depression from spreading from the export-industries to the industries which cater for the home market-,it will seldom be possible entirely to prevent the emergence of unemployment in the export trades themselves,3*      It follows from this that to undertake measures for the-main tonance of the&apos; general level of domestic demand for goods and services is a duty which each government owes not merely to its own nationals, but to the world as a whole.Accordingly, it must be a basic element In any internationalemployment policy to secure from governments - particularly the governments of the main trading nations - an unambiguousrecognition of their&apos; international responsibility In this regard.A-      In addition, something can be done to promote effectivedomestic measures for full einployment by an organisedinterchange of information about the nature, scale and timing of those measures.      The Economic and Social Council of theUnited Nations Organisation, together with its Economic andEmploymerrb Commission and the Employment Sub-Cormuission ofthat Commission, will provide a suitable organisation (in theterms of the United States  &quot;Proposals for Consideration by anInternational Conference on Trade and Employment&quot;) &quot;for thecollection, analysis- and exchange of information on employmentproblems, trends and policies&quot; and for enabling nations to consult regularly on employment problems.11 *    The Protection of a Country&apos;a balance of Payments5*      The adoption of effective domestic measures forthe maintenance of full employment is the essential basis.If all important countries adopt ed exge ctive policies ofthis kind, no international depression need ever develop.Everything should, therefore,, be done by interned ionalpledge and by international consultat ion to promote theadoption of effective domestic action.      But it would befoolish to plan ahead on the assumption that such action will be a hundred per cent effective.      In so far as itfails, the countries which do adopt effective domesticmeasures for the maintenance of their internal demand arelikely to be faced with balance of payments difficulties,since the demand tor their exports will fall while their demand for imports will be maintained.6.      In so far as countries in this situation are willingdad able to finance the temporary adverse balance of payments,they will be making a definite  contribution to the problemof world depression, since they will be maintaining their demand for other countries&apos;  goods in spite of the declinein the other countries&apos;  demand for their goods.      countries may not, however, be in a financial position, to face an unfavourable balance of payments;  and even if they are,the unfavourable balance of payments may Intensify theirown domestic problems of maintaining full employment.      Theymust, therefore, be in a position to prevent the decline of employment and demand&quot; in the outside world from risingan adverse effect on the trade balance of the countrymaintaining demand and employment at home; by such measures as a--1-6-

(a) an adjustment of oxch.ango-ra.tos in order tomaintain stability in domestic prices and incomes in spite of the fluctuations inexternal prices and incomes:(h) the imposition of import restrictions by the&quot;full employment&quot;  country:(c) the application of discriminatory restrictionsagainst countries whose currencies have becomescarce because they are importing too little.7-      All throe of these methods are contemplated under certain circumstances by the rules of the proposed Inter-national Trade Organisation which is to permit quantitativerestriction of imports on a rion-diocualiTiinatory basis to a country which is in balance of payments difficulties andby the rules of the International Monetary Fund which permit the dopre elation of the exeha.nge-ra.to  of a country whichis in a. &quot;fundamental disc-quilihrixrax&quot; without regard to&quot;the domestic,    social or political policies of the memberproposing the change&quot; and the imposition of diacriminatoryrestrictions against imports from a. country whose currencyis in scarce supply.8.      If, therefore, a depression does develop in a particular country or group of countries,  and In so far as this causesan increased pressure on the balance of payments of othercountries, any country which is adversely affected may,  sofar as its domestic level of employment is concerned, offset the adverse movement in its balance of trade by some domesticexpansion (for example, of home Investment programmes) andmeet the adverse movement in. its balance of payments either bylending less abroad than previously, or by borrowing more,If, however, it prefers to offset the adverse movement in itsbalance of payments, there are  at least three possibilitieswhich may be open to i t s -(l) It may depreciate its currency in order to maintainstability In its domestic prices and incomes in spite of the fluctuation in external prices and i n c orae s j(2) it may impose non-discriminatory restrictions onits imports from all sources, and attempt to use the resources which were previously producingexports to produce, for itself those things which it decides no longer to import;  or(3) If the pressure from the countries where adepression has developed is so strong as to cause the  currencies of those; countries to becomeX     .    scarce, it may,restrict imports from thosecountries without restricting its imports from,other &quot;full employment&quot; countries,9.     A country which needs to protect its balance of payments will have an unfettered right to undertake  certain of&quot;theseactions.      For example, it will be able, without question, to cease lending abroad if it.were already doing so, &quot;todepreciate its currency by 10 per cent., ana&apos; to make certainuse of its borrowing powers with the International monetary fund..     It will also have a right in such circumstances to&quot;

impose non-discriminatory restrictions on its  imports., q qalt he ugh the exact form ox&apos; the &quot;-criteria and requirements    ^in the light of which halance of payments restrictionsmight be imposed&quot; remain to be determined.    In other casesits right to take action will be contingent:    either uponthe nature of the pressure on the balance of payments as determined by certain objective criteria, or by the judgment of dn*international bogy (for example,  the imposition of discriminatory import restrictions .will depend upon whetherthe Fund has run out of its supplies ox&apos; a particularcurrencyj, while the right to depreciate the currency beyond. acertain point will depend upon agreement with the international monetary Fund that the country in question ia, in a &quot;fundamentaldisequilibrium&quot;)j    or upon persuading an international body to take some action which is entirely cab the disc ret ion ofthat body (for example,  increased borrowing through the medium of the International Lank for Reconstruction andDevelopment,  or tho International Monetary Fund,  will depend upon the decision of these organisations respectively).10.      The choice between the various alternative methodsenumerated in paragraph o above, must depend largely uponthe particular circumstances of each case.    Moreover,  thereis no reason to believe that in each particular caseabsolute reliance must be placed upon one single method.It may well bo that a combination of methods would andshould be used.    For example,  it might be appropriate thata. particular country which is maintaining a domestic full employment policy and in consequence ia threatened withbalance of payments difficulties should protect its externalposition partly by lending less abroad or by borrowingrather more from abroad than normally, partly by a moderatedepreciation of its currency (particularly if such adepreciation is judged to be necessary for its long-termequilibrium)  and partly by some restriction of imports.11,      Nevertheless,  there will always bo some choice betweenalternatives and in making this choice regard should bepaid both by the national governments and by the international bodies concerned to the particular advantages and disadvantages of each method:-(1)    Offsetting a decline in a country&apos;s production andemployment due to external depression by increaseddomestic expenditure in that country and financing the consequ^confidential  adverse balance ofpayments by reduced lending,  increased borrowingor the loss of reserves is a method which.,  fromthe point of view of the world as a whole,  is most effective in maintaining total world demand.It may also have advantages for the country whosebalance of payments is adversely affected.Particularly in the case of underdeveloped countries3        it may afford an opportunity for putt in;,; intooperation capital works which will enhance the productivity of the country.    On the other handthis solution, unlike the others,  does nothing torectify tee balance of trade,  as distinct from thebalance of payments, and therefore does not directly&quot; contribute- to maintain employment in tho countryapplying it.    It may be difficult for some such countries to generate the offsetting expenditurerequired,  and it may be unreasonable to ask

them to incur such difficulties as a means oxsaving the countries from which the slumporiginated from even deeper depression.Therefore while it is desirable that countrieswilling&quot; to pursue this policy should receiveevery facility for doing so, it is    perhapsstretching international solidarity too far atpresent to suggest that any country should be compelled to adopt-this solution of its balance ofpayments difficulties, particularly if it shouldinvolve increasing capital imports,2) Exchange depreciation as a moans of meeting atemporary disequilibrium has its own particulardisadvantages.      The immediate effect ofexchange depreciation is to aggravate, ratherthan correct, an adverse balance of trade,and though this situation is rapidly reversed,the favourable effect takes some time togather strength;      This circumstance reduces the value of exchange depreciation as a devicefor dealing with the type of relatively short-term cyclical disequilibria in the balance oftrade which are now under&apos; consideration.Moreover, reliance on this method, by giving rise to expectations of substantial fluctuations in exchange-rates, would tend to generate large-scale movements of &quot;hot money&quot; which, is notprevented by exchange control, would make recourse to depreciation more frequent than might at first sight appear necessary, and would lead tomeaningless fluctuations in rates.      For thisreason, this is a method in the use of which duereticence mast be maintained&quot;, especially in so faras its use in particular circumstances isconcerned.      It must also be remembered that nothing is gained from this method in so faras the depreciation of a country which is in&quot;fundamental disequilibrium&quot; is followed bydepreciation on the part of countries whichare not in &quot;fundamental disequilibrium&quot; - a danger against which new arrangements forexchange adjustments may help to guard.Finally,  short-term variations in exchange-rates are disturbing and misleading fer the industriescatering for the export trade or competing withimports.      These; considerations are particularlyrelevant in respect of the dollar-sterling exchange rate, since both are world currencies.      Theymight not be of equal weight in the  case of othercountries, who may feel that exchange depreciationhas the great advantage that it encourages the exports of the country in question as well as dis-ecouraging its imports.      Since the difficulty with which the country in question has to copeis a reduction in its exports due to a fall inthe external demand for its products, this method of adjustment is likely to cause lessstructural unemployment than the solutionsconsidered below.      Moreover, if a number of &quot;full employment&quot; countries with adverse balances ofpayments depreciate their exchanges more or lesspari pasqu, while a group of &quot;unemployment&quot; countries

with favourable &quot;balances of payments are none&apos;of them permittee! to clo so, there will be an adjustment between the two groups of countrieswhich does hot involve any restrictions on the purchases of one &quot;full employment&quot; country from another.(3) Quantitative restrictions on imports also have their peculiar dangers..      Since they arelikely&quot;to be applied to particular imports,they will protect particular groups ofinternal producers and may thus give rise-to vested interests;, which will make thereturn to a more liberal commercial policymore difficult when the crisis has passed,Moreover,  they put matters right merely by restricting imports and do nothing to stimulate exports; and since the trouble willhave started largely through a decline in thedemand for the country&apos; s exports, they arelikely to leave behind them at least an appreciable volume of structural unemployment.Finally, import restrictions on a non-discriminatory basis , in the process of restoring equilibrium between a group of&quot;full employment&quot; countries on the one hand anda group of &quot;unemployment&quot; countries on the otherwill inevitably cut down trade between the11 fu 11 eiiiployment&quot; countries themse 1 ves ,possibly to a very substantial extent.(h) This last disadvantage of non-discriminatoryimport restrictions - though not the others -can be wholly avoided if the generating centre of depression is so localised and yet so powerfulthat it causes the currencies of some or all of tho &quot;uneinploymont&quot; countries to become &quot;scarce&quot;.In this case, the &quot;full employment&quot;  countries willbe permitted to cut clown their imports from thecountries of &quot;scarce&quot;  currency without settingup any additional barriers to trade between themselves.      This solution, however,  is of somewhatuncertain availability, and may work inequitablyas between &quot;unemployment&quot; countries, some of whose currencies may be &quot;scarce&quot; and others not.1.TT-    ili.re.ct_ Action by International. OrganisationsIS.    In the present stage of International economic organisation, the direct action necessary to maintain thetotal world demand for goods and services at a high and stable level must, in the main, be the sum of individual nationalefforts.      Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to assume that even in present conditions the direct action which can be taken  to Influence total world demand by existing or proposed international organisations need be negligible.      In the^present infancy of these institutions it would probablybe unwise to overload them with specific duties which in anycase will remain irrelevant during tho present period ofshortages.      But an Examination of the possibility of theaction which they might take with their present powers whenthe times comes suggests that their direct contribution mightbe really appreciable,.

(1) International Buffer Stocks10213.    One form of direct international action which has wonmuch support in recent years, partly on account of the- contriBution it would make towards the stabilisation of world demand and employment, is the-operation of internationallyowned buffer stocks consisting of commodities., particularfoodstuffs and raw materials, entering into world trade.These  stocks would be expanded and contracted in such a way as to offset the fluctuations in current demand and supply andto moderate the price variations which normally occur in thecourse of the trade cycle.      There are several reasons why this form of investment,  if found feasible for particular commodities, would call for international action.      Theprincipal reason is that where a commodity is of ahomogeneous character, produced By a number of countries,and traded in a competitive world market,  it does not pay any single producing country to undertake the risks and possible losses involved in a. buffer stock policy designedto sustain a stabilised&apos; demand for the product in question,since so much of the benefit of the policy accrues to othercountries.    - Any one country which tried to maintain the incomes of its producers during a depression by pursuing aBuffer stock policy on its own would find itself supporting the entire world market, buying up the entire world surplus,and spending largo- amounts of foreign exchange.      In default of an international scheme, it -would be tempted to coupleits buffer stock policy with the restriction of imports.Ill,    A group of exporting countries might find it worth while to get together for the purpose of maintaining prices by theacquisition of stocks during times of depression, thereby notmerely support in;;-; the incomes of producers but also quitepossibly reducing the drain of foreign exchange which usuallyafflicts primary producing countries at such times.      but such producer-nom.ina.ted schemes would tend to fix prices too high and would probably end up in a. scheme for restrictingoutput which might permanently impovoxaish the world.      Theonly way of obtaining the stabilising effect of a bufferstock scheme without running into the dangers of encouragingnational pro to etlonism or into rriat ional fostrictlonism lies in the organisation of truly international schemes run byconsuming and producing countries together.15,    In the interests of an international policy for full employment, therefore,  careful study needs to be given tothe possible institution of international buffer stock schemesfor the control of various primary products.      The proposed,T,0,  and its commodity commission should be invited toexamine the possibilities of organising such internationalbuffer stocks and - in consultation with the international monetary Bund and of the Internetional Bank for reconstruction and Development - to consider the possible methods of operatingand financing them,( ii)  International Public works16,    There is one form of capital expenditure which can onlyBe organised on an internattonal Basis, namely works thebenefit of which will accrue to a number of different states,or which require for their execution combined action by anumber of stakes,, and which, for one or other of these reasons, no single state has an adequate incentive, or7

during a world slump by too fear that an export of capital to other countries where similar action had &quot;not as yet &quot;beentaken would endanger their rep or ves:i)d.21.    It is possible, however, that the importance of theco-ordination of credit policies is currently.somewhatunderestimated.      Control of capita.], movements is far fromperfect even in the countries with the most effectiveadministrative machines,  and may be expected to become lessso;  In other countries it may be impossible to operate a really effective capital control; and such control is in anycase powerless to prevent a cessation of the inflow ofcapital in the case of countries which are normally capitalimporters,22,    There is at present no formal internaliohai arrangement for harmonising the interest rate policy of different countries,      The circumstances which determine what is, at any -time, the appreciate policy to pursue with respect to creditcontrol and interest rates are so complex that action cannotbe reduced to rule or written into an international agreement,progress in this sphere will therefore be best achieved by consultation between monetary anthprifles.      For this theihferhatldhal Monetary Fund might offer a suitable meetingground,23.    In addition to this, the Fund should be  consulted asto other ways -in which, when the time - comes, it couldinfliionce the general terms of credit,(b) Control over Inter;aatio;).naI (bgeital Movements2ha    As Was argued in paragraph 2 above, any general depressionstarting in one country or group of countries is likelyto lead to a reduction in the exports and an increasein the imports of other countries.      For example,a depression in the United States would almost certainly have an adverse effect on the trade balances of this country,Belgium.:, etc.      This, in itself, as was pointed out, will tend to give rise to vinemployment here and in Belgium,  .  Butin addition to this, the adverse trade balance would tendto deplete our monetary reserves ana  if these are inadequate to stand the strain,, Belgium and the U, K. would be underpressure to pursue a deflationary policy which, at the costof accentuating depression and unemployment at home, would help to restore imports and rectify the balance of trails.If on the other hand, as would of course be desirable,^wewere to pursue the opposite policy of expanding expenditure at home to mitigate the unemployment resulting from thedepression abroad, this action would accentuate our balanceof payments difficulties.      One way of meeting these difficulties would be to finance the trade deficits of thefull employment countries by increasing the export ofcapital from the The. a,  while diminishing ar*y.^Jxport ofcapital from - or increasing any import of capital to -Belgium and the UAfA25.    As is explained in the preceding Section, there arealternative ways of mooting the si e balance of payments difficulties.      Nevertheless, if in time a of depression any country is prepared to maintain its own domestic demand andto allow its demand for imports temporarily to exceed itsexports, it should be given all reasonable en copr agorae ni

29.      What is required in addition to a recognition by national governments of their international duty to adoptdomestic policies for the maintenance of full employment is:first,  action of many different kinds by a number ofdifferent international Specialised Agencies on the linessummarised above-    and, secondly, some international co--ordinating bods?&quot; which can provide a centre both, for theexchange of information about domestic problems and policies for full employment and also for the co-ordination of theactivities in this field of the various internationalSpecialised Agencies.30.      The obvious body to perform this second function isthe Economic and Social Council of the United FationsOrganisation which, working through its Economic andEmployment Commission (and. the Sub-Committees of thatCommission on Employment,  on the Balances of Payments,  andon Economic Development) should perform the followingf unc t i ons ; -(i)    Tho organised, collection , analysis and exchangeof economic information relevant for the study of the trends of employment throughout theWorld.(ii,)    Tho organised interchange between national governments of Information about domesticemployment problems and policies.(iii)    The co-ordination of the work of the internationalSpecialised Agencies in this field.(iv)    The consideration of the proper timing of economic development in undeveloped areas,(v)    The summoning where it deems desirable of specialinternational conferences.-2h-

to do so,  since it will be malting a positive contribution to&quot;the world problem of maintaining the demand for goods and services.    The International Monetary Fund and theInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development shouldbe asked to consider to what extent and in what way they can make a contribution Tn this regard.2.6.      It is not,  of course,  suggested that the international bank or the -International Fund should promote the internationalflow of capital as a permanent means of meeting the balanceof payments difficulties of countries which are in a more orless chronic position of &quot;fundamental disequilibrium&quot;.    Insuch cases long-term equilibrium can be restored only by an adjustment of exchange rates or of similar underlyingfactors.IV.      T he I n t e r n a t i on a 1 h go n c i e s27.      The above paragraphs should make it clear that responsibility for the successful prosecution of aninternational policy for full employment cannot be allocated to any ono Specialised Agency alone.    It is particularly important that this responsibility should not be allocated to the proposed International Trade Organisation.    There isa view which is not uncommonly held,  that the reduction oftrade &quot;barriers will itself lead to high levels of employment and Is the essential feature of an International full employment policy.    This view is,  however,  economicallyunsound.    It is true,  of course,  that the expanded market for its exports which a country may hope to enjoy throughthe reduction of trade barriers in other markets, will leadto an expansion of employment in its export industries.    ButIf this country has at the same time to reduce its ownbarriers against imports,  increased imports will flow intoits territory-    and those increased imports are  just as likely to raise unemployment in its industries which compete with imports as the increased exports are to reduce unemployment in its export Industries.    The fundamentaladvantage of more liberal international trading conditions is not that it will give: a greater volume of employment allround, but that it will raise output per head all round by allowing each country to concentrate more on the productionof those goods and services which it is relatively mostfitted to produce.    The fundamental feature of an internationalemployment policy must he to superimpose upon a more liberalinternational trading policy (which is required for thesetotally different reasons),  a general nexus of national and international policies specifically designed to increase and maintain the total demand for goods and services In periodswhen widespread economic depression threatens.28.      There is an undoubted danger that,   if the primary responsibility for International Employment Policy is allotted to the International Trade Organisation, encouragement willbe given to the view that this duty is adequately performed by the liberalisation of international trading policies.This would bo little short of calamitous.    We must not once more get into the position in which It is taken for granted that if trading conditions can be liberalised., employment will he maintained.    The maintenance of employment,  on whichall our hopes for a permanent liberalisation of trading conditions must ultimately rest,  requires separate and positive action.
