October 1946. &quot;        11The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.   It is issued for the persona! use of.......................^frb...    /.TOP SECRET Copycp. (46) 376.11th October, 1946.CABINET.25AMENDMENT OE THE PARLIAMENT ACT.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.I was asked to prepare a Paper for the Cabinet setting out the existing position of the powers of the House of Lords under the Parliament Act, 1911,and to indicate what modifications might be made in the provisions of that Act(CM. (46) 60th Conclusions, Minute 2).2.   It may be convenient in the first place to summarise briefly that Act.It contains a preamble, two sections of which should be borne in mind &apos;&apos; And whereas it is intended to substitute for the House of Lords asit at present exists a Second Chamber constituted on a popular instead of hereditary basis, but such substitution cannot be immediately brought intooperation :And whereas provision will require hereafter to be made by parliament in a measure effecting such substitution for limiting and defining the powersof the new Second Chamber, but it is expedient to make such provision asin this Act appears for restricting the existing powers of the House ofLords :&quot;3. Section 1 deals with Money Bills that is a Public Bill which in theopinion of the Speaker contains only provisions dealing with such matters astaxation or the raising or guarantee of loans. With regard to any such Bill,if it is not passed by the House of Lords without amendment within one month after it is sent to that House, it shall become law on receiving the Royal Assentnotwithstanding that the House of Lords have not consented.4. Section 2 deals with Public Bills other than Money Bills or Billsextending the duration of Parliament for more than five years and provides asfollows  &quot; 2. (1) If any Public Bill (other than a Money Bill or a Bill containingany provision to extend the maximum duration of Parliament beyond fiveyears) is passed by the House of Commons in three successive sessions i(whether of the same Parliament or not), and, having been sent up to theHouse of Lords at least one month before the end of the session, is rejected by the House of Lords in each of those sessions, that Bill shall, on itsrejection for the third time by the House of Lords, unless the House of&quot;Commons direct to the contrary, be presented to His Majesty and become an act of Parliament on the Royal Assent being signified thereto, notwith-standing that the House of Lords have not consented to the Bill: Providedthat this provision shall not take effect unless two years have elapsedbetween the date of the second reading in the first of those sessions of theBill in the House of Commons and the date on which it passes the Houseof Commons in the third of those sessions.&quot;[32520]
5. The Parliament Act contains other minor provisions about amendments which might be suggested by the House of Commons without being incorporated in a Bill, and various other matters. It further provided that the expression&quot; Public Bill &quot; was not to include any Bill confirming a Provisional Order, andfixed the maximum duration of Parliament as five years instead of seven.6. It will be observed, therefore, that so far as Public Bills are concerned, ifthey are to pass under the Parliament Act, they must pass in three successivesessions and that a minimum period of two years must elapse between the firstsecond reading in the House of Commons and the final passing of the Bill inthat House.In the Debates on the Act Sir Henry Dalziel moved to leave out the word&quot;three&quot; (&quot;three successive Sessions&quot;) and to insert the word &quot;two.&quot; TheHome Secretary (Mr. Churchill) resisted the amendment and used the followinglanguage (Hansard, 25th April, 1911, col. 1702)  &quot; We cannot assent to reduce the period to two years, or the number oftimes a measure must be passed through the House from three years to two years. We have never disguised from ourselves or from the Committeethe fact that the powers which the House of Lords will possess when this Billis passed into law are very great and substantial powers, and that if theywere vexatiously used, that is to say in that partisan spirit which hascharacterised the action of that House in recent times, they would undoubtedly impose severe disabilities and disadvantages against the present government, and probably any democratic Government, from which theGovernments which are returned by Conservative majorities would be whollyexempt. We have never disguised that. We recognise that we are leavingthem real, serious and practical safeguards. ...&quot;7. If it were thought desirable to curtail the existing powers of the Houseof Lords it would of course be possible to do so by following the lines ofSir Henry Dalziehs amendment so as to provide that if any Bill passed theHouse of Commons in two successive sessions, then it should, on. receiving theRoyal Assent, become law even although the House of Lords were unwilling topass it, so long as some minimum period say one year instead of the existingrequirement of two years-had elapsed.8. A Bill limited to this topic could be drafted on very short and simplelines.For instance, taking the section as set out in paragraph 4 of this Paper, thefollowing alterations would be sufficient to effect the desired change : ^3 Line,(4. for &quot;three&quot; read &quot;two.&quot;*7 Line 8, for &quot; third &quot; read &quot; second.&quot;Ii Line IS, for &quot; two years have &quot; read &quot; one year has.&quot;iu. Line Mi, for &quot;third&quot; read &quot;second.&quot;9. The constitution of Eire contains a provision which limits the power ofthe Senate in a more drastic manner. The Senate consisting of sixty membersis elected for twelve years, one quarter being elected every three years on theprinciple of proportional representation. They are elected from a panel con-sisting as to two-thirds nominees of the Dail and as to one-third nominees of the senate itself. The Dail has exclusive competence with regard to Money Billscertified to be such by its Chairman. As regards other Bills, the Senate maypropose and the Dail may consider amendments, but a Bill passed by the Dailand considered by the Senate shall, 270 days after it has been sent up to the latter,be deemed to have been passed by both Houses in its original form unless thisperiod is extended by agreement of both Houses.I append a Schedule dealing with the Dominion constitutions in relation tothis matter.10. There is another aspect which requires consideration in relation to subordinate legislation or provisional order Bills. With regard to these mattersthere is no restriction under the Parliament Act on the powers of the House ofLords. If an Order in Council requires positive approval of both Houses or canbe vacated by Resolution of either Flouse, there is nothing in the Parliament Actto affect this position. It will be realised that this is because in the various Billsdealing with Orders in Council both Houses have been given an equal right.This could be dealt with by providing in future Bills that the approval of onlythe House of Commons was necessary and that the Order could only be vacatedby their prayer.   Alternatively, it might be provided in a general Act that if
the House of Lords passed a Resolution annulling an Order in Council it couldbe restored by a positive Resolution of the House of Commons and in that eventshould be deemed to have received the approval of the House of Lords.11. It may be useful to recall the proceedings during the first session of thepresent Parliament in the House of Lords. On the Borrowing (Control and guarantees) Bill there was inserted against the Governments desire a clauselimiting the operation of the Bill to five years, but when the Bill returned fromthe House of Commons this amendment was not insisted on. Two amendments tothe Coal Industry Nationalisation Bill were carried : both of them were, however,settled during the passage of the Bill by alternative amendments which were satisfactory to the Government. A resolution on agriculture which implied acriticism of the Government was carried. On the Civil Aviation Bill an amend-ment establishing a Scottish Corporation was carried. This amendment was rejected by the Commons when the Bill was returned and was not insisted onwhen it came back to the House of Lords. No other hostile amendments have beencarried and it cannot therefore be said at the present time that the House hasmade harsh or unreasonable use of its undoubted power to carry such amendments.12. The fact that they have such a power is, however, undoubted; and it isof course possible that in the closing years of Parliament these powers may beused to a very much greater extent than they have been used during the first session. A question of high policy therefore arises as to whether it is desirableto take steps now to deal with the situation, or whether it is desirable to dealwith the situation in the light of experience as one of the matters to be put beforethe Electorate when the next election comes.13. If it were to be decided as a matter of polic)&apos;- that a Bill curtailing theexisting powers of the House of Lords should be introduced and passed, it mightbe necessary to make use of the powers of the Parliament Act to secure thepassage of such a Bill into law. If these powers are to be invoked the Bill wouldhave to be passed by the House of Commons in three successive sessions, and twoyears would have to elapse between the date of the second reading in the first session and the date of third reading in the third session.The element of time should therefore be considered in formulating our programme.14. If it were to be decided to bring in a Bill restrictng the powers of theHouse of Lords, the question of the reform of the House of Lords itself would obviously come up in an acute form. This matter has come under the attentionof the Secretary of State for the Dominions in his capacity as Leader of theHouse of Lords and I understand he is putting in a Paper dealing with thismatter.15. I should add that I have consulted Parliamentary draftsmen upon this paper. I am informed that a Bill confined to the purposes outlined inparagraphs 7 and 8 of this Paper could be prepared quickly. Rather more time would be required if it is decided also to deal with the subject mentioned inparagraph 10 as although the great majority of cases could probably be covered by-general words once the policy is decided upon there would be several special cases to be considered : for instance, that of Orders in Council under the Governmentof India Act which both Houses have power to amend. It is obvious that ifprovisions for the reform of the House of Lords were required much more timefor the preparation of the Bill would be required.J.House of Lords, S.W. 1,Uth October, 1946.Schedule.Canada. The Senate is nominated by the Crown. There is no provisionfor avoiding a deadlock between the Senate and the House of Commons, exceptthat the Governor-General may add to the Senate eight additional members.2. Australia. Senators are elected by the various States for six years. Ifthe Senate fails to pass a Bill of the Lower Elouse or passes it with amendments to which the Lower House cannot agree, the Governor-General may dissolve bothHouses simultaneously, and if after the dissolution the Lower House again
passes the Bill and the Upper House fails to pass, it, the Governor-General mayconvene a joint sitting of both Houses and the matter is then disposed of bya majority sitting in joint Session.3. Union of South Africa. The Senate consists of forty members, one-eighth of whom are nominated by the Crown and the remaining thirty-two selected by the Legislatures of the four former Colonies, eight for each Colony. the senate cannot originate or amend any Money Bill. If the Senate rejects a Billin two successive sessions a fresh Legislative Chamber has to be created whichconsists of the two Houses assembled together in joint session, and the decisionof the majority prevails. If the Bill in question is a Money Bill then a majorityof both Chambers sitting together will settle the matter at once.4. New Zealand. The Legislative Council (corresponding to a Senate) isa nominated body. The Act granting a Constitution to New Zealand (15 and 16Vic. Ch. 72) does not prescribe the powers of the Legislative Council and a subsequent Statute (20 and 21 Vic. Ch. 53) enables the General Assembly toamend or repeal all or any of the provisions of the former Act. I understandthat a Bill to provide for the powers and duties of both the General assembly and the Legislative Council was prepared by the New Zealand Government aslong ago as 1914, but it was not proceeded with. The proceedings of the Counciland the Assembly appear to be governed by convention.5. Eire. The Senate, consisting of sixty members, is elected for twelve years, one-quarter being elected every three years on the principle of proportional representation. They are elected from a panel consisting as to two-thirdsnominees of the Dail and as to one-third nominees of the Senate itself. the dail has exclusive competence with regard to Money Bills certified to be such by its Chairman. As regard other Bills, the Senate may propose and the Dail may consider amendments, but a Bill passed by the Dail and considered by the Senateshall, 270 days after it has been sent up to the latter, be deemed to have been passed by both Houses in its original form unless this period is extended by agree-ment of both Houses. When a Bill, other than a Money Bill, has been sent to the senate a Joint Sitting of the Members of both Houses may, on a resolution passedby the Senate, be convened for the purpose of debating, but not of voting upon,the proposals of the Bill or any amendment of the same.October, 1946.
