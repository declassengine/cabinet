(46) 391.18th October, 1946.CABINET.EIRE AND NORTHERN IRELAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I have read with very great interest the memorandum by the Lord Presidentcirculated as CP. (46) 381. I should like to congratulate him both on the very clear and interesting account which he has given of the position and also on hishandling of what cannot have been an easy interview with Mr. de Valera.I am glad to take this opportunity to express to my colleagues my views asto our policy in regard to the question of Partition. For my part I find myselfentirely in agreement with the line which the Lord President took in his conversa-tion with Mr. de Valera and would only wish to offer a few comments.It is clear that Mr. de Valera and the present Eire Government intend tomaintain on all public and other occasions their agitation in favour of ending of Partition. There are, indeed, many evidences of a plan to intensify thisagitation in all possible directions and in a manner which seems calculated toexcite the Catholic Nationalists in the North to outbreaks of violence. We must,therefore, be quite clear as to the line which we should take.To my mind there are two essential considerations. First, the attitude of themajority of the inhabitants of the six counties of Northern Ireland. It is clearthat they are determined to oppose any form of union with Eire. The roots ofthis feeling go deep. Religion, loyalty to the Crown and the British connection,and material interests are all factors which govern their attitude. They havebeen strengthened in their view by the events of the war and, in particular, bythe Eire Governments attitude of neutrality. It is unthinkable that we couldor should persuade or force them against their will.But in our own interests also it seems to me that on strategic grounds wemust bear in mind the lessons of the war. The retention of a base in NorthernIreland for the protection of shipping was one of the principal factors which enabled us to carry on. Without such a base the task of keeping open the shipping routes(including the transport to this country of the American forces for the invasion ofEurope) would have been infinitely more difficult if not impossible. In the light ofthis it would be folly on our part to throw away the safeguard of our securityprovided by our present position in Northern Ireland unless on terms which will secure its continued availability and the availability of bases also in Eire. Itmust never be forgotten that, when at the time of the fall of France in 1940Mr. de Valera was invited by us to join with us in the war on the understandingthat we would do our best to bring about union with Northern Ireland, hereplied that he could only contemplate a united Ireland on the basis of thewhole being neutral in the war.Whilstit is right to remind ourselves of these facts it is important that we should do all we properly can to promote friendly relations between Eire and ourselves,and I have no desire that we on this side should discourage the North and South,of Ireland, in any move that they may make with the object of getting together.[32562]
As a long-term policy it is no doubt right and indeed inevitable that NorthernIreland and Eire should enter into some kind of closer relation. But, as the lord president says, it is for Eire to give as well as to take, a necessity which asshown by the instance quoted above (and indeed on every occasion when we havemade an &quot; arrangement&quot; with him) Mr. de Valera has so far shown no inclfna-tion to recognise. I am sure therefore that for the present our only safe course is to maintain silence so far as possible and not allow ourselves to be provokedinto controversy. As the Lord President said to Mr. de Valera the wisest courseon all sides is not to hurry this issue. Any pronouncement on our part or any suggestion that we are prepared to give the matter consideration, is, in viewof the strong feelings existing on both sides, certain to lead to serious trouble.We must be careful not to find ourselves on a slippery slope.I emphasise this in view of the activities of the &quot; Friends of Ireland &quot; group of Labour members in the House of Commons who, as one of the planks in their programme, are advocating that we should send a Cabinet Mission to ireland to investigate Partition. This, I am sure, would at once plunge us into thedifficulties to which I have referred above. Generally, I am sure that we oughtto continue the policy which I and my predecessors at the Dominions Office have followed, and decline to be drawn on this matter of Partition.A.Dominions Office, 18th October, 1946.
