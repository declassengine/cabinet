AC Athis document is the property op his britannic majestvs government /Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1946.SECRET.Copy No.CP. (46) 360..27th September, 1946.CABINET.INQUIRY INTO THE PRESS.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.I have been thinking further about the question of an inquiry into the press in the light of the points raised in the discussion at the Cabinet on the 30th July(CM. (46) 75th Conclusions, Minute 2).2. I appreciate that, as the President of the Board of Trade pointed out,in order that the body appointed to undertake such an inquiry should have thefullest powers of getting information, it would be necessary to set it up underthe Tribunals of Enquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921. I had, however, thought thatthe use of this Act was ordinarily reserved for inquiries which were mainly ofa judicial nature, and it seems to me that a Royal Commission would be preferable. I do not think that we wish to give the impression that we arebringing the newspapers to trial, and my conception of the inquiry is rather thatit should undertake a general review of the place which the press should occupyin a democratic community. Most of the information which it would want could&quot;be obtained without special powers, and I doubt whether it would be seriouslyhandicapped by the lack of the powers given by the Tribunals of Enquiry(Evidence) Act. Indeed the newspaper proprietors would, in my judgment, beill advised if they gave any appearance of failing to co-operate in the inquiry.3. As I told the Cabinet, I had not contemplated that the inquiry would necessarily lead to legislation, though it might do so. An authoritative accountof the existing position laying down general principles which should govern theconduct and management of the Press would, however, be valuable in itself.There are certain dangerous tendencies which the mere institution of an inquiry should help to check, and in any case the Press is so important an influence for good or ill in a modern community that in my opinion a review such as I havesuggested is overdue.4. The reasons which I put forward in CP. (46) 298 still seem to me to holdgood. Most of the criticisms of the proposal which have been made in the Pressitself are based upon a misunderstanding deliberate or otherwise of theintention, and upon the mistaken assumption that the object is to restrict thefreedom of the Press. On the other hand, it has had strong backing from Govern-ment supporters and otherwise, and I think that we should be rightly exposed tothe charge of weakness in the face of interested opposition if we turned down the powerfully supported representations of the National Union of Journalists-and the Labour Members of Parliament whose Motion is on the Order Paper.5. It would be of the greatest help if a Judge could be secured as Chairman,and, notwithstanding the Lord Chancellors fear that this may be difficult, I hopethat we may be able to arrange it.6. I accordingly ask the Cabinet to agree to the proposal to set up a RoyalCommission on the lines indicated in CP. (46) 298, and I would suggest that thedecision should be announced in answer to the Question by Mr. Marples now onthe Order Paper for the 8th October.H. M.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,27th September, 1946.[32457]
