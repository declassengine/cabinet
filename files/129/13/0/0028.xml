1 CIRCULATED.....\S\\Q    At   %THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ CrOVERNMBNT----Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 378.Uth October, 1946.CABINET.ADMINISTRATION OF WALES AND MONMOUTHSHIRE.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.THE proposed White Paper on Wales and Monmouthshire will be published in time for the debate on Welsh problems which will probably take place in theweek beginning the 28th October.I should be grateful for the advice of my colleagues on the form of the debate and the terms of any Government Motion. If the debate takes placeon the Adjournment, Members would, of course, be unable to raise mattersinvolving legislation, such as provision for a Secretary of State for Wales, andthe Prime Minister and I, after seeing Mr. Grenfell and Mr. Mainwaring lastweek, felt that this would not adequately meet the wishes of the Welsh Parlia-mentary Party.I suggest, therefore, that, subject to any views which may be expressed byMr. Grenfell and Mr. Mainwaring on behalf of the Welsh Parliamentary Party,the debate should take place on a Government Motion, which might be in theform that the House welcomes the publication of the White Paper on Wales and monmouthshire, and the Governments decision further to integrate andco-ordinate Governmental and administrative machinery in Wales and Monmouth-shire.H. M.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,14th October, 1946.[32529]
