(46) 45th Conclusions, Minute 8,the Cabinet agreed that v/e should support the proposal of theSouth African Government to incorporate in. the Union of SouthAfrica the Mandated. Territory of South-West Africa,  &quot;if theconsent of the native, as well as the European,  inhabitantshad been sought and obtained by methods agreeable to theUnited Nations1/.    I so informed General Smuts on 14th May.2. \ Since then,(l) the South African Government have consulted the natives by methods described in Annex I.

3.      The Parliamentary Under-Secrotary of State at theDominions   Office has ascertained by discussion with theSouth African High Commissioner that, although the SouthAfrican Government have not yet answered the .&quot;J,S. note,  theyare likely to reject both proposals in it, and to bringthe question before the United Nations   Organisation assembly at the impending session.4.      The High Commissioner made it plain that, if the UnitedKingdom Government were now to announce their attitude in theterms of the Cabinet decision of 13th May, this would bedeeply resented by.the South African Government,  since itwould bo regarded as support for the proposal in the U.S.note for an International Commission and as distrust on thepart of the United Kingdom Government of the enquiries whichthe South African Government have themselves carried outin South-V/e-st Africa.    On the other hand,   silence on thepart of the United Kingdom Delegation as to the attitudeof the United Kingdom Government until the views of otherGovernments had been expressed in the Assembly would be interpreted by foreign countries as tacit disapprovaland would equally be resented by the South african government.    I am clear that the Cabinet was anxious tosupport   South Africa in this matter,  subject to any necessary safeguards, and. it is the developments whichhave since taken place that have rendered inappropriatethe formula approved on 13th May.5.     The South African Government have given us full and frank information.    The terms of their consultation with the natives seem well adapted to the latter&apos;s conprehension.There is no reason, to believe that different methods wouldhave produeed substantially different results.6.      I ask my colleagues to agree that the methods areagreeable to us,  and that the United Kingdom. Delegation maybe authorised, to state accordingly at New York, and tosupport the South African case.7.     A decision on the matter has become more pressingbecause a question is to bo asked in the Commons on14th October.    I suggest that the Parliamentary Under-Secrotary of State, Dominions Office,  be authorized to state in his reply that His Majesty&apos;s Government here supportsthe South African c use and is satisfied as to the steps taken by the South African Government to ascertain thewishes of the inhabitants.    A draft of the full replyto the question is given&apos; in Annex IV.S.      I am clear that nothing short of this,  in thecircumstances as they now ere, will make the SouthAfrican Government confident that we are giving them allthe help that they feel entitled to expect from us.9.      As to the U.S.  enquiry, there can,  of course, be noquestion of joining the U.8.  in putting pressure on Souln^.frica,  and the only possible course seems to be to defer a reply to the U.S.. until we know what answerSouth Africa; makes to the U.S. note and then to refer theU.S.  to this, and., to state our &quot;attitude.    I shall keepin touch with the South&apos;African Government on this aspect.

10.    Even with our support it is of course by no moans certainthat the South.African Government will got their way at theU&apos;.N.O. Assembly.    But,  if they do not,  it is of the highest importance to our relations with them that they should not feelthat their lack of success was in any degree duo to our failure todo all that we reasonably could on their behalf.    Prom thisstandpoint, I feel it is important that the Dominions Office should-be represented Ministerially in the United Kingdom Delegationwhen this question - coraos up in $Tew York, and I propose therefore that Mr. A.G. Bottomley,- the Parliamentary under-Secretary ofState in the Dominions Office, should join our Delegationfor this purpose.ADominions Office.STH OCTOBER,  1946.SOUTH-aEBT AFRICACONSULTATION,OF;THE NATIVE INHABITANTSExtract from Memorandum by the Seuth African Governmen%The consultation of the non-Europeans necessarilypresented certain difficulties as it was essential that theyshould clearly understand the implications of the question at issue and that their differing tribal customs be observed.It was therefore decided &quot;to entrust consultation to officials who had the necessary experience in Native affairs and&apos;whoenjoyed the confidence of the non-Europeans.    Moreover, havingregard to Native custom and. susc optibilities it was arranged to consult the different tribes as units and not Individuals.The officials specially selected were the NativeCommissioners and. certain Magistrates (who are also localNative Commissioners) who were instructed, to emphasise thefact that the Natives were a free people and. therefore hadthe right to express their views without fear.    It wasalso arranged that, in so far as tribal considerationspermitted thereof,  similar terms should be employed in both address and in the different memorials to bo submitted,for signature.&apos;Following are quotations from the address delivered to the tribal meetings: -&quot;I have asked you all to attend this Meeting as I wish your answer to be the voice of all the people who live in this reserve.    You must understandthat you are free people and can always expressyour views, whatever they -are, -without fear.Similar meetings are being held in all the native reserves and these meetings are being addressed

by Native Commissioners (Magistrates) or the districts concerned.    They are using the same- wordsas.x will use today so that all the &quot;peoxde willunderstand this big question fully and so that therecan be no misunderstanding among the people of the;various Reserves.&quot;The memorials road as follows:-We, the undersigned. Chiefs, Headman or board members of the-people of&apos; the ...........tribe, who live in the...............Reserve- in this Mandated territory of South West Africa,  acting with full authority of thepeople of the tribe of the....... Reserve wish to saythat we have heard that the people of the world are talkingabout the administration of countries such as ours andthat the administration of those countries maybe changed.We and our people wish the following matters to be known to the peoples of the world:1.      That our people have bean happy and have prosperedunder the rule of the Government of the Union ofSouth Africa, and. that we should, like that Governmentto continue to rule us;2.      that wo do not wish.any other Government or people to rule us; and3.      that we would like our country to become part of theUnion of South Africa.Following is a detailed summary showing the resultsof the consultations and the numbers of those who wi.ro soconsulted.: -Territory or Reserve Tribe Population tonearest 10.IN FAVOUROV^MBOLjjND OndongaUkusnyamaUkuambiGkandjcraOka 1; ..nkn thi ) .12&apos;.), 700UkualuthiOmbalanturind EundaOKAVANGC and UkuangariWESTERN CAPRIVI BurwjaZTPFEL Sambio ) 90,M;OJjirikoITbulcushuPOLICE ZONE Ovambo andOYj .v o igo bribes- 21,, 71)0men (nota: uo:i.o 1 J ;/ eon-Hi suited)

Thiswas due to the fact that they are scattered on farms overthe whole Territory and - because- of the absence of authorisedtribal Headmen.It will aIso.be observed that the Natives against the incorporation of the Territory with the Union are, in themain, Hereros.    in fact, apart from some &apos;.&apos;U4 in the Kaokovoldand 1,574 in the Otjituo Reserve, all the Nereros are

against incorporation.    This,  it&quot;is believed, is duo to the traditional grievance of the Herores that their country wasnot returned to them after the defeat of Germany in \7orldear i.    Any form, of government limiting their independence would be equally objectionable to them,    That they are incapable of such status which would only enable them to restartthe internecine tribal wars of the past does net,  of course,enter their minds.However,  the result of consultation is briefly:-These figures,  it is submitted,  speak for themselves;and when one considers the terms in which many of the replies by Headmen and. others in authority were couchedthere con be no doubt as to the feelings of the non-Europeans&apos;&apos;.    Indeed, the words of Councillor-HeadmenShitala Namangangala of Ovambeland that,  &quot;we are like man who has lived a long time with a good wife.......a man wholikes his first wife does not gat rid of her......  it is so with, this Government of ours....&quot;, constitute a clear andunequivocal reply to President Wilson&apos;s remark at versailles that &quot;if South Africa managed South West africa as well as she had managed her own country then she wouldbe married, to South West Africa.&quot;1.      The United States appreciates  the desire of the Unionof South Africa., in accordance with the declaration ma.de at theLondon session of the General Assembly of the United Nations,  tosubmit the metier of the annexation of South-West Africa to theGeneral Assembly for judgment, and. appreciates also its willingness to postpone the discussion of substance this year when trusteeagreements affecting other rn.ande.tes will we hope he concluded.The United States has a special interest in the disposition of South-West Africa becuase of its position, as one of theremaining effective principal Allied and Associated rowersto whom Germany renounced all her rights and titles overher overseas possessions.    The United States would not wish to keep the future of South-West Africa uncertainover too long a period and hopes in the interest of South-West Africa and. of the entire United Nations trusteeship system that decision regarding status of the, territorymay be reached at the 1947 session of the general assembly.2.      We believe&apos; as a matter of principle thatdetermination of the permanent status of any mandated or trust territory, whether this status is j;a&apos;oposo&apos;d. as annexation,ForAgainstNo t c on s ul t e d208,85055,52056,790AMTLX 11UNITED STATES COMMUNICATION J?0 TEA S(* GOVERNMENT ,   24TH: SBPTBMBERTT. 946*a SOUTH AFRICAN

independence,  or some other form of s.elf-government, shouldbe in the interests of the inhabitants and in accordance withtheir freely expressed wishes and with the approval of theGeneral Assembly which would have to satisfy itself onthese points.    While the United Stales,  of course, has nodoubt of the good faith of the Union of South Africa, webelieve that determination of the-desire of the inhabitants of anymandated or trust territory concerning their future status and decision as to their welfare must be made as a matterof principle by the competent United Nations organ on thebasis of objective and impartial inquiry Of its&quot;own.3.      Accordingly5 we would welcome and strongly support atthe General Assembly meeting scheduled to begin 23rd October,a proposal by Field-Marshal Smuts, who has already madenotable contribution to the mandates idea and whosecontributions to the Preamble and other parts of the united nations Charter are well remembered,  that a United nations commission be established for the purpose of visiting South-West Africa,, and, on the basis of an estimate&apos; of the desires       &amp;of the inhabitants and of their best interest,  of formulatingrecommendations to the 1947 session of the General Assemblyas to whether the mandate should be&apos;annexed or should beplaced under trusteeship.    Wo would,  of course,  abide by the General Assembly decision and would not insist on anyspecial voice by reason of our position as one of theprincipal Allied and associated Powers.4.      The Commission might  include ropresontatives of theUnited States, United Kingdom and France as remaining principal allied and associated powers, and perhaps four other membersof the United Nations selected by the General Assembly.Naturally this question would have to b e decided by theGeneral, Assembly.5.      In event that such Commission should recommend trustee-ship,  the Union of South Africa would,  of course, be in aposition to propose terms which would fully protect itsinterests.    It would be useful to point out that the Unionas sole administering authority would obtain all practicaladvantages of assimilation.    For example, the terms could include provisions for (1) the continued administration ofSouth-West Africa as an integral part of the Union of SouthAfrica,  (2) the Union&apos;a maintenance of bases and use ofmilitary forces and facilities in the territory,(3) self-government instead of independence as goal,(4) representation in the Parliament of the Union ofSouth Africa,  (5) a customs union,  and (6) control of immigration.6.     We hone that only the procedural question ofestablishing such a Commission willb e discussed at theforthcoming&quot;session of the General Assembly.    During the interval between the 1946 and 1947 sessions of the general assembly,  terms of the present mandate would apply as announced by the Union of South Africa at the FinalAssembly of the League of Nations.

ANNEX IIIU.8. Embassy, London,to Foreign Office.v ^ v ,. ,,. 1st  October,  1946.A    A   A    A   AThe enclosure gives the substance of a communication which has been made by the Departmentof State to the South African Minister in Washington,which we are also transmitting to Field-Marshal Smuts.When the Marshal returns to London from Paris, we hope to have the opportunity of discus sing the matter with himbefore  the opening of the General Assembly in New York.In our view the United Kingdom, France, and theUnited States, as three remaining effective principal allied and associated powers, have special concern inany change of status in Sbuth-West Africa,  based onrights and titles retained in Germany&apos;s overseas possesions.    While willing to acquiesce in any decision taken by a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly,the United States strongly favours an impartial survey of the entire problem of South-West Africa before the1947 session of the General Assembly.    In consequence,we desire to exchange views with the United Kingdom andFrance in the hope that all three Governments will endorse the procedure suggested to South Africa.I should like to report to the Department of state the views of the United Kingdom and. anything you can tellme as to the probable attitude of your General AssemblyDelegation on this subject.X  X   X   X   XANNEX IVQuestion by Mr. Rees-Wi11iams,14th October, 1946.To ask the Under-Secretory of State for DominionAffairs, what steps have been taken to ascertain the vi ewsof the native -African peoples of the mandated territory of South-West Africa on the proposed incorporation of theterritory in the Union of South Africa.Draft ReplyHis. Majesty1 s Government in the Union of SouthAfrica have supplied the following statement i-In order that the non-Europoan inhabitants ofSouth-West Africa should clearly understand the implications of the questions at -issue, the consultation of them was entrusted-8-

to of&quot;.C&apos;iciuls with&apos; the necessary experience in nativeaffairs, who enjoy the confidence of the natives.Having regard, tp native custom,  the different tribeswere-consulted as units, and not as individuals.    the officials selected were instructed to emphasise thatthe natives were a free people and had the right toexpress their views without fear.    In accordancewith the undertaking given by the Union government at the .first- part cf the first session of theUnited Nations General Assembly held in London inJanuary,  the detailed results of this consultationwill be communicated to the second part of thefirst session of the General Assembly at its meeting in New York this month.Briefly the consultation shewed that -208,850 of the non-European population were infavour of their country becoming part of the Union;53,520 were against; while 56,790 could not be consulted, the latter number being made up forthe most part of persons scattered across the farmsof the territory or nomads such as the bushmen.I take this opportunity to say that His Majesty&apos;s   ,Government in the United Kingdom supports the SouthAfrican case and is satisfied as to the steps takenby the South African Government to ascertain the wishes of the inhabitants.
