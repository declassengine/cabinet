DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GO VERNMENTS-E^-R-E-TCP. (46) 59220TH OCTOBER,   1946COFY NOCAJilJSMINECESSITY FOR I POLING THE CEREAL SUPPLIES:OF THEBRITISH AND UNITED STATES ZONES OF GERMANY.Memorandum by the Minister of Food.1.      I feel that I must draw my colleague&apos;s attention to an urgent matter which arises from the Foreign Secretary&apos;sand the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s memoranda on Germany(CP. (46) 363 and CP.  (46) 385).2.      I suggest that it is as important (and even more urgentin time) to induce the United States Government to pool the cereal supplies of the two zones, as to shoulder a dueproportion of the financial burden.3.      The programme of United States cereal exports for october to December has now been received.      It provides565,000 tons for the two German zones but of this only140,000 tons (wheat .the smaller Americanthan 425,000 tons ai-quivalent) for the British Zone, whileZone is to be provided with no lessh.      1hQ,OOO tons is an amount wholly insufficient for theneeds of the British Zone.      If no more is provided rationingin our zone will break down,  possibly before the end of theyear.      On the other hand 565,000 tons i. s possibly justenough to get the two zones through to the end of the year if it is shared equitably between them.5.      It is,  this year,  impossible for us to help the british zone by diverting our own supplies.      All probable supplies available to us by December&apos; 31st from sources other than theUnited States will be insufficient to meet the requirementsof the United Kingdom and other areas of direct UnitedKingdom responsibility leaving less than nothing from these other sources for the British Zone of Germany - or for that matter for India.

 Z2 P  1iX uppliesCanadaAustraliargentina1343*3180.115.aTotal1*538.8Deficit Supplies against Requirements386.6The prospect of securing any substantially greaterquantity of cereals from the Argentine by the end ofDecember is poor.      There is no chance of getting increased supplies from Canada owing to ever growing transport delays.Therefore to meet the deficit to tho above areas of british responsibility - quite apart from the British Zone - suppliesmust come from tho United States.        Yet the U.S.A. fourthquarter programme proposes to make available only 58,000 tons for the United Kingdom and areas of United Kingdomresponsibility (other than the British Zone and India).      Inaddition shipments for the United Kingdom during the quarter in respect of earlier loading programmes will be about 132,000tons.      There remains therefore an uncovered balance of1965600 tons of wheat,,      Therefore any diversion of UnitedKingdom supplies to the British Zone during the quarterwould be at the direct risk,  of inability to maintain ourbread ration or it is not too much to say,  of starvation inBritish Colonies.6.      In the House of Commons on 3rd July last I declared,  onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government,  &quot;that we cannot, after having rationed our bread for our own people,  direct furtherstocks from this country to supplement that ration in theWestern Zone of Germany&quot;.      I consider it a matter of thegreatest importance to secure an early end to bread rationingin the United Kingdom.      But wheat is coming in so slowlythat even without diversions and with the maintenance of a ceiling on consumption it is still impossible to propose a date for the end of bread rationing.      With consumption inthis country limited,  with reserves absorbed,  and our stock position much less favourable than it was last year I  submit that there is no possibility of making diversions or loans to Germany before December 31st - or for that matter - sofar as can be foreseen during the remainder of this crop year.7.      If the total of 565sOOO tons to be exported from theU.S.A.  to Western Germany as a whole had been shared betweenthe two Zones proportionately on the basis of their statedimport requirements for the crop year,  the British Zone wouldhave received over 300,000 tons.      Such an allocation would still impose a great strain upon distribution within ourZone and would not permit any accumulation towards tho targetstock of 1+00,000 tons, which it is considered desirable tobuild up.      However,  it would permit maintenance of theincreased ration up to the end of the year.

8,      It appears,   that,  pending completion of the arrangementsfor ,the economic integration of the Zones,  the Americans,notwithstanding their agreement in principle to integration,are not prepared to accept any pooling of supplies to ensureequal treatment of the Zones,      Indeed&quot;,  they have stated that until integration is complete they wish the needs of eachZone  to be presented separately to the I.E.F.C.  by therespective governments,9.      This position must be made clear to the AmericanGovernment so that they realise that unless they pool forth with the supplies which they have allocated to the two GermanZones,  an early breakdown will occur in the ration in theBritish Zone of Germany and the United Kingdom will bepowerless to prevent it.      The fact must be brought home tothe United States Government that such a disaster wouldcompletely wreck the policy for Germany which Mr.  Byrnesoutlined in his Stuttgart speech - and have the most farreaching consequences for the whole world position of Britainand America.10.    Apart from the problem of the German zones I shall haveto submit a further paper at a very early date calling attention to the urgent need to induce the United StatesGovernment to revise their cereals export programme for thefourth quarter of 19p6,  so that a more reasonable amount.than58,000 tons (see para k above)  is exported from the U.S.A.  toprevent famine in the British Colonial areas of responsibility.I will also deal with the longer term problems of wheat,  riceand fats which cannot be solved during this crop year unlessthe co-operation of the United States Government is secured.II .    Re c dmmenda t i o nMeanwhile in order to deal with the immediate german problem it is,  I submit,   urgently necessary that we should add to the political and economic proposals contained, in theForeign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer 1spaper the following strong representations to the UnitedStates Government,  viz.   that it is immediately and imperativelynecessary that foodstuffs for the British and United StatesZones should be pooled notwithstanding any delay in completing the integration of the Zones.      It should be made clear to theUnited States Government at the earliest possible moment that even with such pooling,  the margin of safety on the presentUnited States programme for the British and&apos; American Zones is small and that without it, an early breakdown in the rationsin the British Zone with the consequent unforeseeable political consequences,  which it would be quite impossible for theUnited Kingdom ewen to attempt to prevent by diversions from her own inadequate supplies,  is unavoidable,(Intd.)
