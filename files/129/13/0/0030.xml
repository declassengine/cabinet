Although the transitional scheme for the call-up of men to the Forcesapproved by the Cabinet on the 27th May (CM. (46) 52nd Conclusions Minute 3)and published in Cmd. 6831 covers the period up to the 31st December, 1948,there are strong reasons why the Cabinet should now reach a decision on theform of national service which should be adopted from the 1st January, 1949.A decision is needed not only to provide the Services with a basis on which to plan their development, but also to give a reasonable time within which our industrial and educational arrangements can be adapted to fit in with whatevercalls it may be necessary to make on our man-power for national service.2. At meetings on the 16th and 17th October (D.O. (46) 27th and 28thMeetings) the Defence Committee examined proposals for a permanent schemeof national service which had been drawn up by the Official Working Party on man-Power, and their conclusions, together with an indication of the reasonson which they are based, are set-out in the remaining paragraphs of this memo-randum. I now ask the Cabinet to consider the conclusions and to arrive ata decision which would enable a statement of the Governments intentions tobe included in The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament on the12th November.
3.   The man-power needs of the Services in peacetime are two-fold : (a) a whole-time embodied trained force to carry out their day to daypeacetime commitments; and(6) a reserve of trained men which would enable our regular and auxiliary forces to be expanded to the requisite size for the defence of our interests immediately on the outbreak of a major war.The Defence Committee have reviewed the estimates of the numbers required for these purposes which were put forward by the Man-Power working party. In doing so the Committee sought to form the best possible estimateof the tasks, largely of the nature of police work, which are likely to fall tothe Services in normal peacetime conditions. They also had regard to the lessons of the late war, the probable future trends of development in weapons and methods of warfare, and the extent to which in any future major war the UnitedKingdom might reasonably hope to obtain a larger measure of help from theother members of the British Commonwealth. The conclusions reached by theCommittee were :  (i) that neither the Army nor the Royal Air Force could draw fromvoluntary sources enough men to bring their embodied forces upto the requisite strength to discharge their peacetime tasks; and(ii) that, without compulsory national service, all three Services would lackthe necessary reserves for expansion in the event of war.From the point of view of the needs of the Services, therefore, there appearedto be no alternative to the retention of compulsory national service as a permanent feature of our defence policy.4. If a permanent scheme of compulsory national service were adopted and if the period of service were fixed at 1^ years, the man-power availablefor the Services, including both volunteers and conscripts, in a normal peacetimeyear, eg., 1952, would be as shown in the following table : Whole-time embodiedtrained force. Reserves.Royal Navy       .........       162,000 210,000Army      ............      320,000 830,000Royal Air Force.........      299,000 155,000Total   ...      ......      781,000 1,195,000Thus at any given time there would be 781,000 trained men in the Services inorder to enable them to carry out their peacetime tasks, and 1,195,000 trained men in reserve to provide for the necessary expansion on the outbreak of a major war. In addition to a whole-time trained embodied force of 781,000,there would be a considerable body of men under training which, with instructors,would amount to rather more than 180,000.   Accordingly, the number of men
actually serving at any one time would be 968,500* if the period of nationalservice were fixed at 1^ years. This figure assumes that the Services would beable to absorb a maximum of 35,000 women.5. Having reviewed the needs of the Services, the Defence Committee thensought to assess the effect on the economic life of the country of the withdrawalof labour from industries and services for national service. For this purpose they had before them the note appended to this memorandum, which attempts to forecast the country&apos;s man-power position in 1952. The basis of this note is necessarily highly speculative, and its conclusions can therefore be no more thanouesses within a fairly wide margin of error. Average output per head of theworking population is particularly difficult to estimate, since future productivityper man-hour and the effect of prospective changes in the number of working hours are both hard to forecast with any confidence. The broad picture thatemerges, however, is that, if the average output per head is no higher in 1952 thanin 1939 it will be impossible simultaneously (a) to provide for the Services the numbers of men indicated in paragraph above;(b) to effect by 1952 the contemplated degree of expansion from the 1939level in exports, investment, housing, education and in government service;(c) to regain by 1952 even the 1939 volume of goods and services for civilianuse a volume which cannot itself be considered satisfactory as a target for 1952.The deficiency in terms of man-power in 1952 in respect of all three requirements would, on the most favourable assumptions, be about 400,000 and, on the leastfavourable, about 830,000, if the period of compulsory national service were fixed at 1-^ years. In addition there would be some qualitative loss to the man-power resources of the country through the later entry of men called up to the Forcesinto occupations which require a long period of training. If the period of service were kept down to a year the deficiency would be reduced by just over 100,000.It is thus clear that the burden imposed on the national economy by theadoption of a permanent scheme of compulsory national service would be a heavyone. On the other hand, the lessons of the years between the two wars show onlytoo plainly the disastrous consequences of attempting to play our part in worldI affairs without the necessary backing of force and the conclusion seems inescapablethat, if we are to live up to our responsibilities, we must face the cost of perma-nent compulsory national service. In order to offset the effect on the national economy of the adoption of such a scheme we shall have to taike all possible steps to raise the average rate of output per head in the coming years and toreduce to a minimum the average number of unemployed. It should also bepossible to mitigate the loss to civilian industry through the call-up by vigorousaction to improve the facilities for the training of young workers and byshortening the period of apprenticeship.* The number would be 868,500 if the period was one year.
6. The Defence Committee considered whether, on the assumption that ascheme of compulsory national service is adopted, the period of service shouldbe 1-^ years or one year. If a period of one year were adopted, the estimatedman-power deficiency in 1952 would be from 300,000 to 730,000, as comparedwith 400,000 to 830,000 if the period were 1\ years. On the other hand, unlessthe period of full-time embodied service is 1-J- years the Army will be 60,000 short of the figure needed to discharge its peacetime tasks, and all three Services willlose the very great advantage of having men for long enough to enable them tobe used effectively overseas and so to lighten the very heavy burden of service )abroad which would otherwise fall on the regular forces. Moreover, a period of1-g- years would result in a lower expenditure on overheads and an increase in thegeneral all-round standard of efficiency in the reserve and auxiliary forces. on balance, therefore, the Defence Committee reached the conclusion that the periodof service should be 1^ years.7. The Defence Committee were informed by the Chancellor of theExchequer that according to very preliminary calculations the approximateannual cost of maintaining forces of the order of 968,000 embodied serving men,together with a munitions labour force of 600,000, would be  700 to  750 million.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded the Committee that this figure com-pared with the figure of  500 million which in the time of the coalition government had been regarded as the maximum annual expenditure on the armed forces which the country could support, and he pointed out that, ignoring terminalcharges, expenditure of this magnitude would not permit a saving greatly inexcess of  200 million per annum on the present budget for the Armed forces and would thus leave little scope for reductions in the present level of taxation.8. On the assumption that the recommendation of the Defence Committeein favour of a permanent scheme of compulsory national service, with a period ofservice of \\ years, is approved, certain subsidiary questions arise : -(a) A t what age should men become liable for call-up ?  The present age forcall-up is 18, but it would often cause less dislocation to a man&apos;scourse of education or training for industry if he were able to starthis period of service at the age of 11 \. The Defence Committeeaccordingly felt that men liable for service should have the option ofbeing called up at 17-J.(b) What arrangements should be made for the deferment of apprentices and students ? The burden of compulsory national service on the national economy will be lightened if men are able to select, within reasonable limits, the time at which they perform their national service so as tointerfere as little as possible with their training. It would thereforebe desirable that men who fulfil defined conditions as to studentshipor apprenticeship should be given the option of having their call-updeferred for up to a maximum period of 7 years (i.e:, until the ageof 25). The number of men likely to take advantage of the full period will naturally be small.
5122(c) Should there he a liability for refresher training on all men called upfor national service? The Defence Committee considered that the overall liability for embodied and reserve service should be for 7 years,and agreed to recommend that for a period of b\ years after their release conscripts should be liable to report for refresher training.The question of the period of this refresher training requires further study, and it is intended that the eventual training programmes shouldbe worked out in consultation with industry with a view to causing the minimum disturbance to the civilian economy.(d) Should medically unfit men be required to undertake some other form ofnational service? The standard of fitness which would be applied incalling up men to the Forces would be that in force during the war.Thus only men who were totally unfit would be exempt. In peace-time it would be extremely difficult to decide in what cases any advantage would be gained by transferring unfit men to other work (in whichthey would be inexperienced) for a comparatively short period of1^ years. The kinds of suitable alternative employment for these unfitmen would be very limited and there would be difficulty in placingthem satisfactorily. The Defence Committee accordingly agreed torecommend that men unfit for military service should not be madeliable for any other form of national service.(e) what form of national service should conscientious objectors be requiredto undertakef It seems clear that in fairness conscientious objectorsmust be compelled to undertake some other form of national service.The field for their employment will be more limited in peace than inwar and it will probably be necessary to make special arrangementsfor employing them as a sort of pioneer corps on such work as forestry,land reclamation, &amp;c. They should in any event be subject todirection.(f) otight women to be subject to compulsory national service?   It has beensuggested by the National Council of Women of Great Britain that ifcompulsory national service is introduced for men, a parallel but notidentical scheme should be introduced for women. Any plan of thiskind would raise similar difficulties to those which would arise in attempting to make unfit men perform some alternative form ofnational service, and the Defence Committee agreed that women should not be subject to compulsory national service. The Women&apos;auxiliary Services will, however, be continued on a voluntary basis,and allowance has been made for this in paragraph 4 above.9.   To sum up, I invite the Cabinet (1) To agree that a permanent scheme of compulsory national service formen should be introduced from the 1st January, 1949, and that anannouncement of the Governments intentions should be made inThe King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament;
(2) To agree that the period of embodied service should be 1^ years, and that men should be liable on release for a further 5-1 years&apos; service in thereserve, with an obligation to undergo refresher training;(3) To approve generally the proposals of the Defence Committee withregard to the age of call-up, the deferment of students and apprentices,the treatment of men unfit for military service and of conscientious objectors, and the exemption of women from compulsory nationalservice.C. Ft. A.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,21st October, 1946.APPENDIX.NOTE ON THE ECONOMIC COST OF PERMANENT compulsory national SERVICE.1. Any attempt to forecast the economic effects of the schemes for continuingcompulsory national service must be highly speculative. By 1952, when theschemes may be in normal operation, many of the factors involved in assessing the economic strain may have changed substantially. Thus the significance of anycalculation is to show what factors should be borne in mind in deciding whetherthe need for the scheme is so urgent as to make it necessary to bear the economiccost.2. In Annex A some rough estimates are made of the possible changes,comparing 1952 with 1939, in the man-power position. Account is taken on theone hand of the expected increase in working population and the reduction in umemployment that may be hoped for as a result of a successful policy of stabilisingemployment; on the other hand, estimates are made of the increased require-ments of the forces, of export trade, for building and industrial investment, forthe raising of the school age and for the expansion of Government service, whileallowance is made for a possible reduction in the numbers required for theproduction of equipment and supplies for the Armed Forces. In Annex Bthese estimates are expressed in the form of a balance sheet. Since some of theestimates of increased requirements are highly speculative a range of figures hasbeen given. The result of these calculations is a deficiency of man-power between400,000 and 830,000 on the basis of 1\ years&apos; compulsory national service (about100,000 less if the period of service is one year).3. It must be emphasised that in the event the apparent deficit will, ofcourse, disappear; the deficit figure simply represents the extent to which avail-able resources fail to meet the expected demands and thus measures approximately the extent to which some or all of the programmes expressed in the demands will fail to be achieved.
7 1^04. If the estimates prove accurate they imply, so far as they go, that itwill be impossible to maintain the Armed Forces at the proposed level of nearly one million and at the same time to achieve in full both of the followingobjectives :  (a) The requisite degree of expansion in exports, industrial investment,housing and education and in Government service as compared with1939.(b) The maintenance, even at the pre-war level, of employment on other goods and services for home civilian use.5. The estimates, however, omit two crucial, but at present imponderable,factors : (a) It seems probable that hours of work will be less in 1952 than the pre-war average of 46-^ (the average at the beginning of 1946 Avas already down to45-8 hours); (b) no allowance is made for any increase in average output per man-hour between 1939 and 1952. Achievement of the two objectives listed above would be consistent with the proposed expansion of the Forces only if there were a. sufficient increase in output per man-hour between 1939 and 1952 to offset bothany reduction in hours of work and also the gap between probable supplies and estimated demands.There is at present no evidence that output per man-hour over the whole range of production of goods and services is greater now than it was before thewar. It would certainly be imprudent to rely upon any particular figure of theprobable increase in output per head during the next six years.6. The economic cost of half a million additional men in the Armed Forcesmay be measured in another way. At present prices, the average net output ofa young man in industry is probably about  400 a year. The removal of half amillion young men from industrial employment into the forces w-ould thus repre-sent a loss in production of about  200 million a year.  This loss represents : about 3 per cent, of the expected level of personal expenditure on consump-tion at market prices in 1946-47 ( 6,400 million); oiabout 22 per cent, of the expected level of net fixed investment in 1946-47( 925 million); or about 22 per cent, of the expected level of exports in 1946-47 ( 900 million).Annex A.Expected Changes in Man-Power Supply and Requirements 1952 comparedwith 1939.1. Increased Total Working Poptdation.The Ministry of Labour estimates that working population will be about20,050,000 at mid-1952, compared with 19,750,000 in 1939.
2. Decrease in Unemployment.Allowance is made for 500,000 unemployed in 1952, compared with 1,270,000in 1939. The figure of 500,000 is probably the lowest that could be expected in conditions of &quot; full employment,&quot; making reasonable allowance for such factors as seasonal variations and labour turnover. It leaves no reserve for exceptional difficulties due to special circumstances in any large section ofindustry.3. Armed Forces.If the target of 650,000 regulars and short-term volunteers is attained, thetotal strength of the Forces will be 1,003,000 with 1-* years&apos;, or 898,000 with1 year&apos;s National Service.   This compares with 480,000 in 1939.4. Equipment and Supplies for the Armed Forces.In June 1939 there were 1,270,000 engaged. The Supply Departments esti-mate very provisionally that 600,000 may be needed in 1952.&apos;5. Exports.To balance the country&apos;s inteimational accounts, exports of goods must beincreased by about 70 per cent. A 70 per cent, increase in the 1,150,000 workingdirectly for export in 1939 would require another 800,000. The increase might,however, be as little as 700,000 if account is taken of the possible change in the composition of exports from industries with relatively low output per head(e.g., textiles) to those with higher output per head (e.g., engineering). Inaddition, it is probable that at least 500,000 were engaged indirectly in export(in distribution, transport, &amp;c.) in 1939. A consequential increase of 150,000to 200,000 may well be required in this total.6. Investment.This comprises two items : (a) an expansion in the building labour forceof 250,000 above the 1939 level as part of the Governments housing policy, and(b) the numbers involved in schemes of large-scale industrial re-equipment, suchas those for the coal and iron and steel industries. (It should be noted that thelatter has a military aspect; industrial equipment is part of national economicwar-potential.)7. Increased &quot;Numbers in Government Service (Civil Servants, Local Govern-ment, &amp;c).The numbers have increased greatly during the war and have only shown aslight tendency to decline since its end. Improved education, expansion of social services and the whole structure of the Governments policy will tend to sustaintheir numbers. There are now 450,000 more in Government service than in 1939;it would be imprudent to assume that the total will exceed the 1939 level by lesthan 150,000-300,000 in 1952.
8. Raising of School-Leaving Age to 16.The raising of the school-leaving age from 15 to 16, as envisaged in theEducation Act of 1944, would lose industry about 400,000 juveniles, the equiva-lent, say, of 200,000 adult workers.9. Reservists.At any one time some of those returned to industry after National service will he performing Reserve service.Annex B.Additional Man-Power Supply and Requirements in 1952 compared with1939.
