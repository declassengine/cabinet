THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  October 1946.162SECRET. Copy No. 2cp. (46) 394.21st October, 1946.CABINET.GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS :  INDIANCOMPLAINT AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I have seen the memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(CP. (46) 373) and am in entire agreement with the proposal in it thatthe United Kingdom Delegation at the forthcoming Assembly, while refraining from expressing any opinion on the merits of the Indian complaint, should support the contention, which I understand the Delegation of the Union ofSouth Africa will urge, that the matter is excluded from the purview of theAssembly as one of &quot; domestic jurisdiction &quot; within the meaning of Article 2 (7)of the Charter.2. I agree that there could be no question of our intervening in the merits of the dispute. We have carefully avoided doing this throughout. But it is, inmy view, out of the question that the United Kingdom Delegation should takethe line that, since the dispute lies between two members of the British Common-wealth, they will take no part at all in the discussions. The reasons for thisview are : (1) The interpretation of this vital part of the Charter is a matter whichthe United Kingdom, as one of its framers, cannot properly ignore.(2) It would be a grave matter for the United Kingdom, as a Colonial Powerresponsible for Indian communities and minority groups in variousBritish territories, if any other view than that maintained in para-graph 3 (ii) (b) of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum were adopted.(3) In the circumstances of the case, complete silence by the United kingdom delegation on the question of interpretation of the Charter in this instance would certainly be regarded as indicating that we did not agree with the Union Governments view that the matter is one of domestic jurisdiction. This would inevitably cause resentment in theUnion and would be highly prejudicial to relations with the UnionGovernment.3. I consider, therefore, that it is most important to adopt, without qualification, the Foreign Secretary&apos;s recommendation, and I hope that theCabinet will approve this policy.A.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,21st October, 1946.[32573]
