THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  October 1946.SECRET. Copy No.    35cp. (46) 365.1st October, 19416.CABINET.LABOUR CONDITIONS IN THE ANGLO-IRANIAN OIL COMPANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN view of the frequent discussions in Cabinet about the affairs of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, my colleagues may be interested to see the attachedsummary of the reports rendered to me by the three Members of Parliament who,at my request, visited the Company&apos;s area in June. I am not circulating the full text of the reports because each Member of Parliament put in a separate report and there is thus a considerable amount of over-lapping between the reports.I should add that the report of each member of the Delegation was in all casescountersigned and approved by the other members.Since the receipt of these reports I have had a despatch from His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Tehran containing recommendations for action which, althoughcovering a much wider field, are in general consistent with those put forward by the Parliamentary Delegation, and, as my colleagues are aware, the Ministerof Fuel and Power and I have vigorously impressed on the Chairman of theAnglo-Iranian Oil Company the need for his Company to do everything possibleto provide satisfactory conditions for its Persian employees and to improve its relations with them. In this connexion I should like to record that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company has recently stated that it is fundamental to its policy to pay wages to its labour more favourable than those paid by other employers in Persia. The Company has stated that wage increases granted since the1st March of this year to Persian employees amount to over two million poundsa year. At the same time, the Company is building up its Industrial RelationsDepartment, and with the help of the Ministry of Labour is selecting LabourOfficers for duty in Persia. The Company&apos;s housing and amenity programmerequires supplies from this country, and I have therefore asked my colleagues in the Supply Ministries to ensure that everything possible is done to meet theCompany&apos;s requests for materials.   They have all given the most helpful replies.On the political side, the Delegation made two principal recommendations :That there should be a strong British publicity drive in Persia and that we shouldimpress on the Persian Government that we look to them to provide for thesecurity of our nationals in South Persia. Action has been taken in the sense of both of these recommendations.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,1st October, 1946.ANNEX.Summary of Reports on Labour Conditions in the Anglo-Iranian oil company, presented by Mr. W. N. Cuthbert, M.P., Mr. F. Lee, M.P.,Mr. J. Jones, MP, after their visit to South Persia in June 1946.The Company&apos;s Educational and Training Facilities for Persians.A high standard is maintained at the Company&apos;s training and educationalcentres. Speaking of the Abadan Technical College, Mr. Jones reported thatthe papers were well up to the best of British standards and that the collegeoffered splendid facilities for Persian youths. The facilities offered at youth&apos;hostels for young Persian students were also excellent.13597   [32474]
The Company&apos;s Hospital and Medical Facilities for Persians.Excellent work is being done by the Company&apos;s medical staff, but more staff and accommodation is needed. Mr. Jones noted at one Company hospital anunusual treatment for burns which he thought worthy of consideration by theBritish medical services. Special praise was given to the Ophthalmic Depart-ment of the Company&apos;s medical service which was very busy treating trachoma,which is common in Persia.Conditions of Work.Mr. Lee reported that at the refinery at Abadan, where more than 30,000men are employed, general conditions were good; in fact, the Trade Union didnot complain of the working conditions.The only criticism of working conditions noted in these reports is one byMr. Jones of a sulphur plant at Masjid-i-Suleiman.Mr. Cuthbert reported that when the Governor-General of Ahwaz was askedwhether his countrymen would rather work for Persian or British-ownedindustry, he replied that they seemed to prefer the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company,as workers were always applying to him for recommendations to enable them toget jobs with the Company.Housing.The houses built by the Company are far better than the others in thedistrict, most of which are small mud huts erected by the workers themselves.There is a great need for many more thousands of homes. This situation has arisen because during the war oil output was practically doubled and the numberof employees of the Company was more than doubled, and, as in this country,provision of housing and social amenities was checked. Houses are now being built for the Company in fairly substantial numbers by British contractors.Relations between the Company and its Persian Labour.The Company&apos;s attitude towards its employees appeared more favourable than that displayed in other Persian industries in areas visited by the Delegation.The Delegation felt that the Labour Movement in Khuzistan was genuine but had its immediate clangers in that it was to some degree encouraged and enforcedby intimidation and was being exploited in an anti-British sense at Sovietinstigation. They considered it essential that the initial stages of this genuineTrade Union Movement should be handled from the Company&apos;s side by trainedstaff with a good knowledge of how negotiating machinery should be set up and used. The following quotations from Mr. Jones&apos;s report are of particular interest in this connexion : &apos;&apos; To summarise the position as I personally saw it, I am bound to statethat the interests of His Majesty ^Government with reference to oil supplies from Persia are being jeopardised by the influence now being exercisedthrough the Tudeh Trade Union Movement by our Russian Ally. There isnot the slightest doubt that the desire of the Persian working masses for ahigher and better standard of life is being exploited for reasons which are difficult to determine. It is, of course, humanly impossible to expect evena Persian to advance his knowledge technically in the interests of british oil production and at the same time expect any individual Persian or Persiansnot to acquire knowledge which creates within them a desire for a much better existence than has obtained heretofore. Other influences have had their effect upon the mind of the Persian, i.e., employment by the american forces during the war at comparatively high wage levels for campduties, &amp;c.&quot;&quot; The great immature force which has sprung up in this new TradeUnion Movement should in my opinion be carefully handled by trained personnel who are well versed in Trade Union activity and with a very sound and complete knowledge of collective bargaining. It would be absolutelyfutile to make the effort to deny the right of this new Movement to gain fulland complete recognition as we know it in this country, and a very seriouseffort should be made to obtain the goodwill and constitutional procedure of the officials of the same. The conception of the rights of the Persianas known 20-30 years ago by the Company must undergo a complete and fundamental change and, therefore, I would with respect suggest that HisMajesty&apos;s Government make representation as strongly as possible to theCompany on these lines.&quot;
Wages.The lowest-paid workers in Persian-run industries received considerably lesspay than the lowest-paid workers in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. TheCompany also provided various facilities such as the medical treatment and so on.Mr. Lee reported that much of the unrest could be attributed to the change-over from overtime conditions during the war when a 60-hour week brought afar bigger wage packet than obtains now. There was room for great improve-ment in the pay of the lower-paid workers.Local A uthorities.The standard of Persian local administration was very bad and because ofthis living conditions for workers not provided for by the Anglo-Iranian oil company were of a very low order. Despite the revenue which the PersianGovernment derived from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, including income tax on the pay of all Anglo-Iranian Oil Company employees, they spent nothing onhospitals, schools and housing for Anglo-Iranian Oil Company employees,although these were all matters which should normally be dealt with by the localauthorities and not left to the Company. The Delegation hoped that it might eventually be possible for these responsibilities to be taken over by Persianauthorities from the Company. The Delegation noted the impotence of localPersian Government officials to control the local representatives of the TudehParty.Political Questions.(a) Security of the British Staff. There was considerable apprehension lest the Persian Government should fail to provide security and lest British staff andtheir families might be subjected to violence. The Delegation recommended that immediate steps should be taken to compel the Persian Government to provide thenecessary forces for such security and failing this that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould take urgent measures themselves to ensure the safety of the Britishinterests in South Persia.(b) Propaganda. The Delegation stressed the need of a strong propagandamovement with a view to moulding the Labour Movement into a democratic form.as a result of which it would look to us rather than to others.
