this document is the property of his britannic majest Y&apos;s governmentPrinted for the. Cabinet.   September 1946.SECRET. Copy No.cp. (46) 357.26th September, 1946.CABINET.CABINET COMMITTEES.Note by the Prime Minister.THE burden of work imposed on many Ministers last Session was made moreheavy by the amount of time which they had to spend in attending meetings ofCabinet Committees. It is perhaps inevitable that in the first months after anew Government has taken office an exceptionally large number of problems shouldbe put forward for collective decision by Ministers. In the coming Session,however, means must be found of reducing the demands which Committee work has hitherto made on the time of busy Ministers. The Cabinet Committee system has a valuable part to play in the central machinery of government, both in relieving the pressure on the Cabinet itself and in helping to give practical effectto the principle of collective responsibility at times when the Cabinet does not include all Ministers in charge of Departments. Its value will, however, be impaired if Ministers are asked to spend an excessive amount of time at Com-mittee meetings. This can be avoided if Ministers will (a) refrain from referring to Committees questions which do not engage the collective responsibility ofMinisters and can readily be dealt with by other means; and (b) assist in securing that business which must be discussed in Committee is handled speedily. Tothis end I ask my colleagues to keep in mind, in the coming months, the suggestions set out in the following paragraphs of this note.2. First I look for a marked reduction in the number of problems putforward for discussion by Ministerial Committees.In many fields the broad lines of Government policy have now been settled;and Ministers should find it possible to decide themselves, without discussionamong their colleagues, many questions which in the last Session had to be referredto Committees.Where colleagues have to be consulted, but only two or three are directly concerned, agreement can often be reached by correspondence or by personalmeetings.   Where it is thought likely that a serious conflict of view will develop,
it may be convenient to ask a senior Minister possibly the Chairman of theCabinet Committee to which the problem would otherwise be referred to convene a meeting of the Ministers directly affected and seek to arrive at a settlement between them.Reference to one of the Standing Committees of the Cabinet will still benecessary when important questions of policy are involved, and it is also a convenient method of handling less important matters which are of interest toa number of Departments normally represented on that Committee. committees should not. however, be used for the purpose of transacting less importantbusiness which directly concerns only two cr three of the members of theCommittee.3. Chairmen of Committees should be vigilant to prevent papers coming-forward for discussion in Committee which could be settled otherwise. Apartfrom the methods mentioned in the preceding paragraph, discussions in Coin-mittee can often be avoided by intimating, when a paper is circulated, that its recommendations will be taken to be approved unless comments are sent to theSecretary of the Committee by a specified date.Chairmen should encourage the Secretaries of their Committees to submit to them suggestions for reducing, by these and similar means, the amount ofbusiness to be transacted at full meetings of the Committee.4. A Committee cannot transact its business with efficiency and despatch ifpapers are discussed before Ministers have had time to consider and obtain adviceupon them. It is the rule that a paper for consideration by the Cabinet, otherthan one commenting on a paper already circulated, must be circulated two cleardays before the meeting at which it is to be considered; and exceptions to this rule are made only for matters of extreme urgency, with the sanction of the PrimeMinister. This rule applies also to Cabinet Committees, and their business wouldbe facilitated if Chairmen insisted that it should be complied with, save in themost exceptional circumstances.5. Attendance at Committees should be restricted to the permanent members and other Ministers who have a major interest in the questions under discussion.Ministers should not be required to sit through lengthy discussions in case pointsaffecting their Departments should be raised. Nor should they insist on attendingmeetings for the purpose of making Departmental points which have no important bearing on the main issues under discussion. Such points can always be broughtto the Committee&apos;s notice by a letter to the Chairman or a message to theSecretary.Chairmen and Secretaries of Committees should keep this in mind in deciding which Ministers, other than the permanent members of the Committee,should be invited to meetings.6. Ministers are responsible for seeing- that memoranda circulated to theCabinet and its Ministerial Committees are kept as short as possible and contain,wherever appropriate, a concise summary of the proposals put forward for decision.
Chairmen of Committees are responsible for re-establishing the normal practice whereby Ministers assume that the papers which they have circulatedhave been read and refrain from opening discussion of each item by oral repetition of the arguments already set forth in the papers.The Chairman of a Committee is responsible for the orderly conduct of its business. He should see that discussion is kept to the point and irrelevance orrepetition is checked. It is also his duty, in advance of the meeting, to makehimself thoroughly familiar with the papers circulated and to think out tentativelines along which the issues for discussion might be resolved and, where appro-priate, to take preliminary soundings among his colleagues with a view to avoiding unnecessary discussion.7. The Chairman of a Committee is also responsible for ensuring that theSecretary, under his direction, follows up questions which are not settled at meetings and takes steps either to get them disposed of or to have preliminarypoints discussed outside the Committee so that the issues remaining for decisionmay be clearly defined when the matter is again put on the Committee&apos;s agenda.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,26th September, 1946.
