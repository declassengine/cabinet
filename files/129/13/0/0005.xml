(46) 355.24th September, 1946.CABINET.FULL EMPLOYMENT IN THE SOVIET UNION.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.MY colleagues will recall that in my CP. (46) 309 of the 30th July on full employment in Germany before the War, I mentioned that I had asked theEconomic Section of the Cabinet Office to produce a similar note on the U.S.S.R.I now circulate, for information, the memorandum which the EconomicSection have prepared.Owing to the limited amount of material available, this cannot be as detailedas the one on Germany. It is, I think, interesting and valuable as a generalsurvey.H. M.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,24th September, 1946.Full Employment in the Soviet Union.ALTHOUGH &apos;&apos; full employment&apos;&apos; was long ago achieved in the soviet union in the sense that there was no problem of industrial unemployment, itwould be very dangerous to attempt to draw lessons from the manner in which thiswas done without first stressing the differences between the Soviet and Westerneconomies.2. The Soviet Union after the revolution was fundamentally a peasantcountry with a leavening of industrial wage earners the total number of these in 1917 cannot have exceeded 3 million. Moreover, it was a peasant country ofthe eastern European rather than the western type, with an enormously high rateof population growth, primitive methods of agricultural production and a chronicsurplus of labour on the land which may be regarded as &apos;&apos; concealedunemployment.&apos;&apos;3. Consequently, when industrialisation and economic developmentgenerally were pushed forward there was little difficulty in obtaining unskilled labour, though there was a desperate shortage of skilled. It is hard to say when&quot; concealed unemployment &quot; ceased to exist; it may be presumed that it did not exist in the war, and there was probably relatively little of it for some years before 1941, but one cannot be more precise about it.4.   It is, however, very instructive to consider 1(a) how a high and increasing level of economic activity was attained in theSoviet Union; and(&amp;.) which of the problems connected with full employment in western countries confronted the Soviet authorities.5. There is little difficulty in understanding how economic activity wasstimulated and increased. The Government, being the sole employer of industriallabour and exercising complete control over industrial activity, was able to order as much production as it liked, of whatever kind it liked, up to the limit of theresources at its disposal. The scarce resources which limited its activity were[32437]
plant and skill; but the scarcity of these did not restrict the amount of employment which it was able to give in any rigid way, because a large number of activities were undertaken which demanded little of either. The construction of the WhiteSea Canal and other very large inland water-ways, for instance, was carried outwith much labour and with little capital equipment; a high ratio of labotyrto equipment has, indeed, been characteristic of much Russian production. Thisis, of course, a perfectly normal result of the reasonable and economic use of resources in any undeveloped country where labour is plentiful.6. The distribution of labour between different kinds of activity was naturally not a very difficult matter so long as a ready supply oould be drawn from the under-employed peasantry, and the supply from this source was main-tained all the longer because the mechanisation of agriculture, especially after itscollectivisation, led to economies in agricultural man-power. Up to 1935, whenthe publication of full wage statistics ceased, it was possible to trace the use of differences of wage levels to direct labour to the occupations where it was wantedmost; the industries which were expanding most rapidly had offered higher wages than others. The same instrument for inducing labour to go where it was most needed has certainly continued to be used, and the recent decree raisingwages east of the Urals, as a means of preventing the westward drift of labourevacuated there during the war, shows the continued importance attached towage-inducements. Even in the period when labour was relatively plentiful,however, compulsion was used to obtain it for particularly unpopular work inremote places. The very large amount of oonvict and political prisoner labour which was available in the early 1930&apos;s (largely through the internment ofpeasants who resisted collectivisation) was directed mainly to canal digging andlumbering.7. The (relatively) very high rewards given for skill in the Soviet union were sufficient to attract trainees for industry as fast as the training system couldcope with them until shortly before the war. In 1940, however, a shortage of recruits appears to have been foreseen, and a State Labour Reserve was instituted.This consisted of boys conscripted between the ages of 14 and 17 forbetween six months&apos; and two years&apos; training, followed by four years&apos; work inthe factories to which they were compulsorily assigned. Up to the outbreak ofwar, however, compulsion appears to have been unnecessary, the quota of recruits(up to a million a year) apparently being filled voluntarily.8. A tendency of the workers to drift from job to job too frequently forefficiency was pei&apos;haps a characteristic of the Russian working man rather thana result of full employment; it had existed in Tzarist days. Steps were taken to check it after 1932, when it was ordained, for instance, that any worker leavinghis job without permission might not be re-employed within six months. Itseems, however, that, so far as skilled men were concerned at least, the shortagewas such that factory managers took what labour offered without asking-questions. During the war, of course, a complete system of industrial andmilitary conscription was introduced, and the penalties for desertion were almost as severe on the industrial as on the military front.9. The tendency to price-inflation, with which full employment economiesalways have to reckon, was not entirely escaped in the U.S.S.R. Wages rates or at least the total wage bills in each industry are laid down by the State PlanningCommission; the wholesale prices are apparenty derived from costs of production,allowing planned profit margins, and retail prices are related to wholesale pricesmainly by the extremely high and flexible turnover tax. This turnover tax is thus the chief instrument for preventing inflation. It has to cover most of the gap between total incomes paid out (i.e., the cost of production of all goods and services) and the wholesale value of the goods which the public are allowedto buy. Other taxes, and even some borrowing, help to bridge this gap, but70 per cent, of it is filled by the turnover tax alone. In the conditions of greatscarcity from 1928 to 1935, however, the marketing mechanism could not be trusted to secure equitable distribution of necessities, and these were accordinglyrationed at fixed low prices. A free market remained in which prices roseDtogreat heights, and when rationing was abandoned in 1935 prices of formerlyrationed goods had to be raised three- or four-fold by the imposition of extraturnover tax to secure equilibrium. The nature of the pressure for increased wages is uncertain, but it is clear that wages, as well as prices, rose rapidlybetween the early 1930&apos;s and the war. It was chiefly because of this that therouble had to be devalued in 1936 and again in 1937.
Conclusion.10. As was suggested at the beginning, it is difficult to derive lessons fromSoviet experience which have any great relevance to the very different economies of the West. The method of controlling the level of total economic activity thereis radically different from anything which we are likely to adopt, and theconditions of labour supply are equally remote from ours. It is clear, too, thatthe Soviet Government exercises, and the Russian people is accustomed to, far more stringent control over choice of occupation and level of wages than ispossible here. Nevertheless, it is significant that manipulation of relative wage rates has remained important as a means of directing labour to the places whereit is needed in the Soviet Union, even latterly under conditions approximatingto full employment as we know it.
