(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)S 3ii C R E TC.P.(U6)  553 COPY NO,      ,&quot;- b23RD SEPTEMBER ,  19R6CABINETIpSTPOMEMEPT Cm MUNICIPAL ELECTIONSMemorandum by the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for scotland .      -Ye have &quot;been advised by the Controller of the stationery office that there is a serious risk that the present, ............&apos;difficult conditions in the printing industry may,  in somecases, prevent the holding of the municipal borough elections in England and  /ales on 1st November.      There are two majordifficulties-(a) The Register is required by statute to be published on 15th October and must be available beforenomination day (23rd October) because the signatory to a nomination paper is required tobe on the Register - his number thereon mustbe stated on the nomination paper.(b) The Notice of Poll and the ballot papers willrequire,  in accordance with the time tablecontained in the Second Schedule to the LocalGovernment Act,  1933, to be printed betweenFriday, 25th October, and Thursday, 31st October.2.      Owing to the ban on overtime work in the printingindustry, which has been operative since 12th August,  it isvery doubtful whether the Register for all municipal boroughswill be published in time to be effective for nomination day,or whether Notice of poll and ballot papers could in alleases be printed within a period which was none too long evenin normal conditions.      If the rislc of a breakdown in theseelections is to be avoided, the position can only be safe-guarded by legislation which will amend the Representationof the People Act,  1 9U-5 (as to the publication of theregister) and the Local Government Act,  1933 (as to the timetable for the municipal elections).3.      It would be undesirable to make provision by legislation for the elections to bo held on the register which at presentceases to have effect on 15th October, and accordingly werecommend that at Bill should contain the following provisions relating to England and wales which have been discussed withthe Secretary of the Association of Municipal Corporations.(i)    Phere the register fox1 a municipal borough is published on 15th October, 6th November is to besubstituted for 1st November&apos;,  as the date of election and the time table in the Second

Schedule to the Local Government Act,  1933,  isto he extended by this additional period.This would afford longer time for the printingof the ballot papers but would still enable anannual general meeting to be held on 9thNovember, at which the Mayor and any necessaryAldermen could be elected.      If necessary theannual meeting could be adjourned after theseelections and prior to the appointment of thevarious committees.(ii) Where the register for the whole or part of amunicipal borough is not published on15th October it shall be; published by the electoral Registration Officer concerned assoon as It is available.      In any suchcase:-(a) The forthcoming elections shall be held19 days (excluding Sundays) after thepublication of the Register, i,e.allowing the same period as between  -15th October and 6th November and the intermediate time table in the second schedule to the 1933 Act shall be amended to allow four further days(excluding Sundays) between nominationand poll.(b) The annual general meeting shall be heldsix days (excluding Sunda3^s) after theda:/ of election.      This postponement ofthe general meeting will automaticallycontinue in office the present Mayorand any Aldermen due to retire.(iii) Councillors due to retire on 1st November shallbe continued in office until the day of election.(iv) Electoral   Registration Officers shall beindemnified against failure to publish theregister for any constituency or part of a constituency on 15th October.(v) In order to ensure that an election for a casualvacancy,  which under Section 67 of the 1933Act is required to be filled within 30 days of- notice of the vacancy,  is not held prior to publication of the forthcoming register,  the31.11 should contain a provision whereby the30 days in question is extended by the period by which publication of the register is delayed.Ij.,      Having regard to the  real possibility of a strike..in the printing industry which,  if it occurred between the date of publication of a register and the date of election would render the provisions of the hill nugatory, the Bill wouldalso need to contain.a provision whereby any of the amendeddates for. these elections can he varied &quot;by Order in Council,Exceptional provision is justified in existing circumstances.-2-

5.      So far a,s Scotland&apos; is concerned there seems less likelyto he difficulty unless a strike occurs,  in securingpublication of the register by the 15th October;    but v/cthink it would be wise to provide that if in any area it isnot so published,  it shall be published by the electoral registration officer as soon as it is available.      We do not propose to have any general postponement of the date of .town council elections in Scotland, which will fall on tuesday 5th November&quot;    but to guard against the risk of delay in the publication of the register, or failure (forexample, because of a strike),  to arrange for the printingof ballot papers, we propose that power should be taken byOrder to postpone the date of election,  either generally orin a particular area.6.      ge recommend that approval should he given to the drafting of a Bill on the lines indicated with a&quot; view to its introduction, immediately Parliament reassambles and its passage into law by 15th October.(In-bid.)    J.O.E.Whitehall,  S.W.1.23RD SEPTEMBER,  1,9^+6.
