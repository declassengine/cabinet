IHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (46)  5662ND OCTOBER,  1946. copy NO.CABINETINDIAN POOD REQUIREMENTSMemorandum by the Minister of food..      In his memorandum of the 30th September ,19 46, theSecretary of State for India refers to  the worsening of theposition in India since the date of his previous memorandumof the 2nd idem.      This he attributes (a)  to the strike ofmaritime workers in the United. States of America and(b)  to the non-availability of export licences from theArgentine Government in respect of a- balance of some130,000 tons of cereals already purchased.      Expectedarrivals during October are now estimated at 291,000 tons,and 350,000 tons during November.      These figures compare with 394,000 and 480,000 previously assumed as arrivals for october and November respectively.2.      The figures do not differ materially from our ownestimates and in particular the total for November is necessarily conjectural as it  involves thof the speed with whichU.S. ports.      Insofar as axunderstood that the necessary  exportable butNovemberthis in anyarrivals.unknown factorcargoes will now be cleared fromAvovjntina is concerned it is nowlicences will be avail-event will be  too late to influence3.      To bring stock levels to the equivalent of 5 weeks&apos;consumption requirements  the Secretary of State for Indiaestimates that arrivals would have to be increased by213,000 tons in October or 333,000 tons over October/November in addition to  those now in sight and proposes  thatthis should be partly effected by the diversion of 100,000tons of Canadian wheat programmed for the United Kingdom.Even if such a diversion were agreed to there would stillbe a gap of some 233,000 tons between arrivals and the totalof 775,000 tons required to maintain stocks in India equiva-lent to 5 weeks&apos;   consumption at end November.      On the otherhand if no diversion be made India will still have cover for about 3 weeks, and this is certainly no worse than theposition which obtains  in our For Eastern Colonies, Ceylon,Malaya, Hong Kong and Borneo.4.      From supplies presently assured it will be impossible,owing  to the short fall in rice,   to meet the minimum statedneeds of our I&apos;ar Eastern territories during the periodOctober/December,  even if we divert these territories thewhole of the Canadian flour likely to be available forexport to the United Kingdom and British territories forwhich we procuresome 130,000 torn-1-

5. .    I have received the most urgent appeal from theColonial Secretary in this respect and it seems probablethat it will be necessary to find from somewhere for these territories an additional 87,000 tons of flour over and abovethe quantities which&apos; we had hitherto programmed during thelast quarter of this year.6.      It is  true  that we hope  to  obtain comparatively largequantities of Canadian wheat during the coming quarter, but every  ton of this wheat is urgently needed for the UnitedKingdom and the  territories directly dependent upon us inorder to raise our stock to a level which will enable us togo through the winter months, with their more difficultnavigation, with safety.7.      If diversions of supplies indispensable to restoring theposition in the United Kingdom are now diverted at this  early stage in the crop year, we shall, I take it, have  to  informthe House that we have had  to reconsider the emphaticstatements which we made during the bread rationing debatesthat,  with the introduction of bread rationing,  this country-could not make further sacrifices by way of diversion ofwh dat supplies e s.8.      I note that the Secretary of State for India states  thatthere will be &quot;very grave political repercussions&quot; in India&quot;if His Majesty&apos;s Government should decide in the near future to abolish bread rationing in this country&quot;.    I will not press jfor  the abolition jyf.. bread.-rationing at*&quot;the next ration-^ing.....period , 12th October ,but I cannot possibly accept the&quot;position that this country cannot abolish bread rationingbecause of unfavourable international reactions.      This  isprecisely the situation which I most feared when it wasdecided to proceed with the bread rationing scheme on the eveof its introduction.      If we allow these arguments  to weighwith us unduly, we shall find ourselves in the position ofsaddling the British people with bread rationing at least until the next harvest, and quite possibly beyond that.0.      I therefore cannot recommend  the cliversien of 100,000tons of Canadian wheat from the United Kingdom to India atthis   juncture.      Ho new circumstances have arisen which shouldpermit us  to modify the Cabinet decision of  the 14th Augustlast that &quot;there should be for  the present  no diversion ofwheat shipme nt s d estinod &quot;for  the Uni ted Kingdorn&quot; .      0n thecontrary,.&apos;Canadian September shipments will be over 100,000tons less than the original  Canadian programme.      TheAmerican maritime strikes have delayed shipment of   thebalance of wheat from the United States agreed to at the timeof the Lord President! s visit,  and our own harvest has,of course, been late and disappointing.10.      Wo will, of course, continue to give what assistance isin ear power  to India&apos;s attempts  to procure wheat,  but I must point out that India has. now powerful and effective represen-nation  of her  own in both Washington and&apos; Buenos Aires, andhas  hitherto been more, rather than less,  successful than ourselves in obtaining supplies.J.S.Minis try of Pood ,Whitehall, S.*y-Wl.2.HD OCTOBER ,  1946.-S-
