THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  October 1946.SECEET. Copy No.cp. (46) 382.15th October, 1946.CABINET.AMENDMENT TO THE PARLIAMENT ACT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and leader of the House of Lords.THE Lord Chancellors Memorandum (CP. (46) 376) calls for considerationof policy on which, if action is to be taken, and if there is disagreement betweenthe two Houses upon it, it would be necessary to take the action not later than the session of 1947-48.2. Before discussing the issues, it is desirable to report events of the lastParliament. In November 1943 I was approached by the Marquis of Salisbury,,who enquired as to whether the Labour Party would be willing to consider ameasure for the reform of the House of Lords. I replied that I did not know ofany detailed authoritative statement by the Party on the subject and that thematter could only be considered as without prejudice on either side, but I addedthat I felt sure that in any case no proposals would be considered that perpetuatedthe hereditary right to attend and vote, or that increased the powers of theHouse.3. On this Lord Salisbury said that he would send me a note based on theacceptance of these principles. He subsequently sent me a memorandum enclosinga draft of a short Bill under which no Peer would be entitled to attend and voteunless he received a special writ of summons. The right to receive the writ ofsummons was to be limited to those who possessed the qualifications set out in the-schedule. Broadly, these were to the effect that they were limited to persons appointed Peers because of special distinction or service, to ex-Cabinet Ministers,,to Privy Counsellors and others, including the Lords of Appeal and the SpiritualPeers. The proposals also included the right to appoint a number of life peers.My comment was that the schedule, in my view, was very generous, but thatI could do no more than thank him for his memorandum and make my colleagues of the Labour Party, who were members of the War Cabinet, acquainted with it. I took this action and subsequently informed Lord Salisbury that our view was that the time was not appropriate for any action to be taken.4. The reason behind this action of the Conservative Party, as I have found from several conversations with Lord Cranborne, is that they are very appre-hensive of any possible action by the hundreds of peers who seldom, if ever, attend.Also they are satisfied that the hereditary principle is indefensible.5. At present, I am convinced that there is a great anxiety on the part ofthe Opposition to avoid any conflict between the two Houses and, for my part, Iam inclined to think that the Leaders of the Conservative Party are determined to avoid it if possible.6. It is the case, of course, that after thirty years of the present arrange-ments, the House of Lords seems to have accepted the fact that it is a RevisingChamber, and not authoritative in matters of policy, although we have to remember that for nearly the whole of the time there have been Governments in power to their liking.[32544]
7. It is fair to say that at present we get on very well indeed and there seems to be a clear understanding that the House must accept the mandate of thepeople. There is, of course, no sort of guarantee that this attitude will remainafter a year or two, except that I am quite sure that I have stated the desires ofthe Leaders of the Conservatives in the House of Lords correctly.8. If any action were taken at all, I am convinced that it would be very,desirable, and be more likely to be accepted, if it were accompanied by a reform of the House something on the lines of the suggestions already referred to.9. The question is whether it is desirable to make any move at all. my view is that to do so now might seem to be provocative unless it could be doneby agreement. My disposition is to continue as we are going on, rememberingthat if, in a year or two&apos;s time, the Lords took some action which was directlycontrary to the policy of the Party, they would be providing us beforehand withan unanswerable case for action. Meanwhile, we might have proposalsconsidered and formulated in the event of a dispute between the two Houses.House of Lords, S.W. 1,15th October, 1946.A
