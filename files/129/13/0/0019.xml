CHURCHILLlleraora.nd.urn by the Prime minister mr. Churchill,  in the letter reproduced as the appendix to this memorandum,  says that he wishes to give his accountof the British A/ar story,- and asks whether there is any objection in principle to his including in this story certaindocuments.      He has submitted specimens of the documents,which consist of:-(i)   memoranda circulated to the gar Cabinet onitrategic issuessuch as Defence Against(ii)(iii)Invasion,  the Mediterranean situation,Norway iron ore traffic;minutes addressed to the Chiefs of Staffs or tohis colleagues on strategic matters or matters relating to the war effort;telegrams to President Roosevelt and other headsof governments.2.      On y the basis of the general policy approved by theCabinet/- the following points must be considered: -(a) ,/oulcl disclosure of any of these matters injureus in our relations with other nations or be contrary to the public interest?(b) Would it impair the confidential relationships between Ministers,  or between Ministers andtheir advisers?(c) Is it a breach of the rule that the publication in externso of official documents,    otherwisethen by the Stationery Office,  should be allowedonly in very exceptional cases;    and then only when the document is in some sense personal   tothe writer?(d) Is consultation necessary,  e.g. with the U.8.Government in regard to the telegrams to president Roosevelt?3.      As to (a) and (b)  above, Mr.  Churchill says in his letter that he is ready to discuss the omission of anyparticular phrase,  sentence or passage,   to which objectionmay be taken,  and that he would agree to the text beingrevised on behalf of the Government before publication,  inthe light of the situation existing at the time./    CP. (US) 138

As to (c):,  it may be thought that Mr.  Churchill &quot;position,  sad the character of the documents which he wishes to quote, would justify his case being treateda s exc ep t i on a 1.s to (&amp;).,  I understand that although  it is not strictly necessary to consult another Government beforepublishing communications addressed to it,   the ForeignOffice normally do so before  publishing a series of suchcommunications,  from which the general tenor of the replies may be inferred.      This would be all the more necessary in the present case, where it is proposed to publish summaries of the replies received by Mr.  Churchill,U.      Since this is the first important case under thegeneral policy/decided by the Cabinet on 23rd May and22nd duly last/&quot; I think my colleagues will wish to havean opportunity of considering what reply should begiven.C.

,,PPBNDIXCopy of a Letter dated 25rcl September,  &apos;\ 9h6from Mr. Churchill to Sir Edward BridgesI am pressed from many quarters to give my accountof the British war story and, without at present making any definite plans,  I have been getting my papers inorder and considering the project.      I should like totell the story so far as possible in ray own wordswritten at the time      as you know a great part of raywork was done in writing (dictated typescript) and Ishould scarcely/ need to publish any documents otherthen those I have composed myself.      I should of coursenot wish to publish any paper which was not considered in the public interest by the Government of the day,and I should be quite ready to discuss the omission ofany particular phrase,  sentence or passage in memorandaotherwise unobjectionable.      Moreover I do not expect that any publication can take place for two or threeyears and 11103- not live so long.      I should agree toa final revision of the text in detail by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment before publication,  in case the foreignsituation might be such as to make what is now harmlessinjurious.      This can only be judged, in the future.2.      I should, like to know, without necessarilyaccepting the view as final, whether in principle therewould be any objection to the publication of the kind of memoranda which are attached to this note.      I feel Ihave a right,  if I so decide,  to tell my tale and I am convinced that it would be to the advantage of our countryto have it tola,  as perhaps I alone can tell it.      Thereare three classes of documents composed by myself whichmust be considered:-(a) Papers written by me as Minister of Defenceor Prime Minister (or as First Lord of theAdmiralty in the early months).      Specimensof these will be found attached..      I mightnot wish to quote these papers in full.That would depend on the course of thenarrative.      But,  subject to the publicinterest being; safeguarded on particular points (as judged by the Government of  theday before publication),  I should like toknow that I am free to use them as I may think fitting to the narrative.(b) There is an immense series of my Minutes whichI had printed for convenience of reference in a series of monthly records.      In usingthese I should naturally consider my ownobligations to oil those who served with or under me.      You have copies of all these in your possession and I should, be veryready to&quot; consult with the Government ofthe day on any particular point which theymight question.      Some day undoubtedly theywill all be published.      However,  in tellinga tale the words written in the circumstancesof the moment are of far greater significancethan any paraphrase of them or subsequentcomposition.

(c)    Finally taero is the &quot;Personal&quot;  correspondence.This consists of ahout 1,000 telegrams to president Roosevelt and his successor andprobably as many more to other Heads of governments within and without the BritishEmpire.      These telegrams will certainlybecome public&apos;one day but,  subject to reviewbefore eventual publication,  they constitute a very favourable explanation of the course and conduct of the National coalition government of which I was the head.The answers which were received to these telegrams from President Roosevelt and fromother Heads of Governments,  includingespecially Dominions, could not of course be published without the agreement of theParties concerned, nor indeed is theirtextual publication necessary to the courseof the narrative.      They could easily besummarised in so far as it is necessary and of course I know all that  happened.3.      What I should like to know now is that the kind of use I propose to make of papers, Minutes and. telegrams which I wrote myself, as the responsible Head of theGovernment, would be agreeable in principle to HisMajesty&apos;s present advisers,  subject of course to a finalreview on particular points and passages by the Governmentof the day before any publication is mode.h.      I should be glad to receive the Prime Minister&apos;view upon this matter at his convenience in order thatI may consider what course to take.

yN 0 T Eif    Ministers having comments on theattached Paper (CP. (h6) 370)  are asked to arrange for them to he sentto me by 10 a.m. on Saturday,i2th October,  19h .The Prime Minister will thendecide,  in the light of any commentsreceived, whether it is necessary thatthe Paper should be discussed at anesting of the Cabinet.(Signed) NORMAN brook cabinet Office,  S.W. 1.8th October,  f92+6-
