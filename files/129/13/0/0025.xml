THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1946.SECRET. - Copy No.CP. (46) 375.8th October, 1946.CABINET.UNITED  STATES  AND CANADIAN  DRY  CARGO  SHIPPING  INOUR SERVICE.Memorandum by Minister of Transport.Part I.FROM time to time in papers upon our shipping resources and prospects Ihave referred to the fact that we have on bareboat charter from the UnitedStates and Canadian Governments a large block of shipping at present operating under our flag and with British crews.These ships are all dry cargo ships. We have no United States tankers onsuch charter. This paper deals only with dry cargo shipping; the tankersituation will require separate consideration.Ships on Bareboat Charter from Canada.2. Excluding ships for military and naval service we have from Canada onbareboat charter about a million tons deadweight of shipping, mainly of ocean-going types. These were taken .up from the Canadian Government during thewar, but in 1945 we successfully negotiated with the Canadian Government anew agreement leaving the ships in our service on bareboat charter for a further period against payment of hire. Under this agreement we must begin tore-deliver the ships to the Canadian Government during 1948 and completere-delivery by September 1949.3. We pay no hire for the ships on military and naval service, of whichwe have 16 (about 160,000 tons deadweight). If ultimately it were decided thatsome of these were worth keeping the purchases would be additional to those proposed in this paper. No immediate difficulty arises in connection with these ships.Ships on Bareboat Charter from the United States.4. These ships were also made available to us during the war. We sought in 1945 to reach an agreement with the United States Government to continue thecharters for a further period, but under the United States Ship Disposal Act theUnited States Government was denied by Congress the power to enter into bare-boat chartering agreements with foreign flags. Nevertheless, they agreed with us not to terminate the wartime agreement for the time being, and we have continued to have the use of the ships, but against payment of dollar hire since december 1945.5. During the summer of this year, I was given to understand that the interim arrangements cannot continue &quot;indefinitely, that the United States Govern-ment are under pressure to terminate them, and that at any time action mightbe taken by Congress, or have to be taken by the United States Government to terminate the agreement precipitately unless we can come to some definite under-standing about the rate of re-delivery.[32519] B
6. We must expect that the United States Government will require us to buy a substantial proportion of these ships, or possibly all of them, as analternative to early re-delivery.7. The tonnage from the United States on bareboat charter amounts to2-8 million deadweight tons, consisting mainly of large oceangoing types of standard design. I think that if we are prepared to buy some of this tonnagewe may succeed in persuading the United States Government to accept there-delivery of the remainder at a reasonable rate over the next two or three yearsrather than to require it next year.8. A few of these ships are in naval or military service. If we cannotspare these within the time set for re-delivery, as we should make every effort to do, we shall have to purchase. Such purchase would be additional to that proposed in this memorandum for civilian purposes, but the problem is on asmall scale and can be treated separately.United States and Canadian Ships on Voyage Charter.9. Apart from this American and Canadian tonnage on bareboat charterwhich is operating under our own flag and with our own crews, we are alsotalking on voyage charter month by month a large number of American and canadian ships under their own flag and with their own crews, to make goodour tonnage deficiencies. These charters require payment of high freights in dollars. While it is no part of our policy to become entirely self-sufficient in shipping, and while we must continue to receive the services of foreign ships in our trades just as we wish to offer our own services to other countries, it is highly undesirable that we should be dependent for so large a part of this foreignhelp upon expensive dollar tonnage. The ships are mainly required in the tramptrades carrying bulk cargoes and the necessity for continuing to charter these ships in considerable numbers is one of the major factors operating against our efforts to get freight rates down to a more reasonable level. While they have tobe taken on the current scale, they tend to make the market.10. Further, so long as we go on taking these ships on voyage charter,we encourage operators to speculate in the tramp trades, taking up the surplus war-built tonnage for the purpose. This would tend to retard the recovery anddevelopment of our own tramp industry, for although in the long run the high cost operators might not be able to sustain highly competitive conditions in worldtramp trades, the harm will have been done by absorbing too many of thesewar-built ships into commercial circulation. When the high cost operators areforced out of business, they will sell their ships as best they can, and there will always be takers of tramp ships at a low enough price.11. These objections operate with less force against Canadian voyagechartering than against chartering of United States ships. The number of canadian ships available is small. The Canadian Government seems at themoment disposed to operate a merchant marine under the Canadian flag, and while in the tramp trades I feel they have no long-term prospects of success, itwas part of the understanding under which we retained so many ships on bareboatcharter that we should continue to use in our trades a reasonable amount oftonnage under the Canadian flag.12. The number of American ships involved, is much larger; we are taking50 or 60 a month at present. There is a vast amount of American tonnage whichcould be taken up by American speculators and the present high rates areattracting them. It must be our object to leave as much American war-builttonnage as possible in the hands of the American Government so that inDecember 1947 it is placed in permanent reserve as required by existing UnitedStates law.13. The conclusion is that we must try now to cover our immediate require-ments of additional tramp shipping, beyond what we and the European maritimenations can supply, by means which do not involve taking large numbers of american ships on voyage charters.Review of Tonnage Requirements and Resources for 1947, 1948 and 1949.14. In Annex B, I have recorded the results of estimates of our tonnagerequirements and resources for these three years.   Even the estimates for 1947
cannot be close and those for later years can only be broad generalisations. Butthe review demonstrates that we cannot afford the loss of all the bareboat charteredtonnage. It also indicates the extent of our dependence upon voyage chartering of American ships, upon which we should have to rely to make good any deficiency.15. Our tonnage needs during the period reviewed, and the effect of loss ofthe bareboat chartered ships upon the employment prospects of our seamen, after allowing for the manning of our own new construction, must be balanced againstthe long-term interests of our shipping and shipbuilding industries. If wepurchase too much war-built tonnage, we shall damage both these interests.Part II.Proposals.16. I propose that we should try to resolve these difficulties on the following-lines : -(i) We should be prepared to purchase a proportion of the United Statesships on bareboat charter. In negotiating this proportion our aim should be to reduce the ultimate net loss of&apos; tonnage by re-delivery tomanageable size. It must be sufficient, of course, to enable us to persuade the United States Government to accept re-delivery of theremainder over a period of years. We must expect to have to re-deliversome ships next year drom July onwards or perhaps earlier but may hope, if we can offer the United States Government limitedpurchase, to spread the re-delivery of the remainder over 2 or 3 years.If we could get an option which would enable us to spread deliveryover a longer period if necessary, so much the better, but it would be unrealistic to base our calculation on extension beyond the end of 1949.(ii) We should also ask the Canadian Government to spread re-deliveryover a longer period, beyond September 194,9. We should not rule outthe possibility of purchasing a limited number of the Canadian ships if that would help to get a satisfactory agreement as to re-delivery ofthe remainder, and provided, of course, the Canadian Governmentwould agree to transfer to United Kingdom Register.(iii) We should be prepared, if necessary, to buy now a limited number ofadditional ships to reduce our dependence upon American and canadian voyage charters to reasonable proportions. The only sourcefrom which we can purchase additional ships is the United StatesGovernment war-built tonnage.17. If we are to buy any ships from the United States or Canada we savedollar expenditure on hire or freights by buying at once.18. Any ship re-delivered to the United States Government after December1947 is required by their present statute to be put into permanent reserve. It isimportant for our long-term shipping interests that the maximum amount of thewar-built tonnage should be withdrawn from trading in this way.Purchase of United States Bareboat Chartered Ships.19. These ships are operated at present by British owners for my account.From preliminary soundings I believe that owners would bid for about 75 of thelarge ocean-gcing types (&quot;Sams&quot; and &quot; Forfs &quot;) if dollars were available.These are ships which owners are operating in trades from which they cannotspare the ships without detriment to our long-term interests; and a limitedpurchase of these American types will help to maintain our footing for a year or two until new buildings come forward.20. In addition, and for similar reasons, owners might bid for a few of aspecial type of smaller ship (&quot; Hickorys &quot;).21. Bareboat chartered tonnage includes 35 intermediate ships (&quot;Baltic&quot;and &quot; Northern Coasters &quot;) which are engaged in our short sea trades, mainly ontimber carrying. We cannot afford to be without these if our timber importsfrom Sweden and the Baltic are to be maintained at a high level. On the otherhand, their price is disproportionately high compared with that of other UnitedStates tonnage and owners could not afford to buy. If I found that these could[32519] b 2
not be retained on bareboat charter at least until the end of 1949, I should be compelled to buy. As there are other bidders (e.g., the Chinese) for these ships,we may have to take this course.22. Purchases of United States chartered ships would thus amount to1 million deadweight tons, more or less, out of 2-8 million tons. I should hopeon this basis to get re-delivery of the remainder spread at least until the endof 1949.Arrangements regarding Canadian, Bareboat Chartered Ships.23. We should aim to get re-delivery of some of the ships postponed afterSeptember 1949. If we have to buy a few Canadian ships, the number wouldbe small, and should reduce correspondingly the American purchase (inparagraph 22).Purchase of Additional Ships.24. According to present information, the Canadians have no more ships to sell, except those on bareboat charter to us. We may also have difficulty in persuading the Americans to sell us additional ships if our proposals for purchaseof those on bareboat charter are not acceptable as on a sufficient scale.25. United Kingdom owners are already bidding with our backing for about40 United States ships of liner type; but the Americans are being extremelyslow in coming to a decision on these bids. Possibly they are waiting to see what we propose to do about the bareboat chartered ships. In all my calculationsI have assumed that the outstanding bids are substantially successful, and that from this source our tonnage resources will be increased, from the beginning of next year, by about 350,000 tons deadweight.26.   The further purchase I have in mind is a maximum of 50 ships of thebulk cargo type to be bought by His Majesty&apos;s Government.27. This further purchase involves an immediate expenditure of 30 million dollars, against which over the next two years or so we could set an equivalentdollar saving in freights. The justification for it depends largely upon thecorrectness of the assessment of the tonnage balance sheet. But we cannot at this date draw up an accurate balance sheet, and, if I am to contemplate as a targeta United Kingdom import programme of 40 million tons in 1947 and 45 million tons (50 per cent, more than 1946) in 1948, we shall need the additional shippingtonnage which a purchase of this order would represent. I feel that my colleagues will wish to run no risk of allowing shipping again to become a limiting factor in our import of food and raw materials. A fleet of 50 ships employedcontinuously on the North Atlantic represents imports of about 2 million tons ayear, or a proportionately lesser quantity if the ships are sent further afield.Apart from this consideration, we should gain the advantages of greater controlover the situation in directions which I have described above.Methods of Purchase.28. Nearly two-thirds of the tonnage would, on these figures, be bought atowners&apos; expense for their own trades, as explained above. Those bought for HisMajesty&apos;s Governments account would be let out to owners in accordance withour general disposal policy, on bareboat charter at a market rate for not less than3 or more than 5 years. While this may leave the Government with some financial loss, I feel we are justified in taking this risk in order to retain a certain flexibility in the determination of policy as to disposal when we can see more clearly thetonnage situation, and the position in our shipbuilding yards, ahead of us in afew years&apos; time.Summary of Proposals..29.-(i) About 1 million deadweight tons of the American and Canadian- Jbareboat chartered tonnage to be purchased for United KingdomRegister,   including approximately 75  &quot;Liberty&quot;  ships whichowners  would  take  over,  together  with  the   &quot;Baltic&quot;  andNorthern Coasters &apos;&apos; which I should purchase for government account;(ii) Re-delivery of the remaining 2-8 million tons on bareboat charter to be deferred as long as possible;.
(iii) Authority to be accorded me to purchase up to an additional 50 ships(about 500,000 deadweight tons) of bulk cargo carrying ships(mainly Liberty ships), not on bareboat charter, for transfer to united Kingdom register.This programme may not eliminate our tonnage difficulties in the next fewyears, but it will reduce them to manageable proportions and limit the reactionson our long-term shipping and shipbuilding prospects.30. I propose that my representatives should open negotiations with theUnited States and Canadian Governments on the above lines while they are in north America for the meeting of the United Maritime Consultative Council.If satisfactory progress cannot be made within the framework of these proposals,I may have to seek further guidance from my colleagues at short notice.31.   The financial implications of the proposals are shown in Annex A.A. B.Ministry of Transport,8th October, 1946.ANNEX A.United States and Canadian Shipping in our Service.Financial Implications of the Proposed Purchases.Dollar Cost of Purchases.There is no fixed price for Canadian ships but they would cost approximately the same as equivalent United States ships.The price of the American ships is fixed under United States legislation,and varies according to age.The oceangoing ships already on our service being relatively old will beobtained at about the minimum price. 75 of these ships will cost about 41 million dollars.The cost of 50 additional large bulk carriers at a slightly higher average price (say, 600,000 dollars per ship) would be about 30 million dollars.The cost of 35 American ships of intermediate type will be about 16^ million dollars.The total dollar expenditure of all the purchases proposed would thereforeamount to some 88 million dollars, to be paid immediately.Foreign Exchange Savings.The dollar outlay on purchasing and operating an American Liberty shipat 600,000 dollars is equivalent to the net dollar outlay on voyage charteringa similar American ship for North Atlantic trading over 21 months, at presentfreight rates. It cannot, of course, be assumed that freight rates will in factremain at the present high level over that period. But on that assumption the dollar cost of purchasing 50 Libertys to save voyage chartering of Libertys underthe American flag to give the same service would be recovered in 21 months.Against the dollar cost of purchasing ships already on bareboat charter canbe set off the dollar expenditure on bareboat charter hire. The dollar cost ofbareboat hire on 75 standard bulk carriers for 3 years amounts to 21-5 million dollars.Intermediate types. The dollar outlay in purchasing these ships can beset against the exchange cost of obtaining the foreign tonnage on voyage charteron which we should have to call if we lost the ships. This is mostly in hardcurrencies. The dollar cost of the purchases would be offset in about three and a half years in this way.Net Cost to the Exchequer of Ptirchases by His Majesty&apos;s Government.The cost of voyage chartering an American ship for North Atlantic tradingat present freight rates is about  50,000 more per annum than the cost of1    voyage chartering a similar British ship.   Assuming that this difference were saved by an importing department on freight payments the cost of the proposed50 additional ships (at  150,000 per ship) would be offset in three years. -
ANNEX B.United States and Canadian Shipping in United Kingdom Service.A. Examination of policy regarding United States and Canadian ships inrelation to estimated requirements and availabilities for 1947, 1948 and 1949.1. Estimates of requirements in 1947 are based upon a United kingdom import programme of 40 million tons, compared with a little over 30 million tons in 1946. The tonnage resources include new buildings expected ^ to be delivered from our yards during the year, United States ships of &quot; C &quot; andVictory type for which owners have already submitted bids for purchase, and services from foreign charter or liner berth (excluding voyage chartering underthe United States flag) at the rate of 1 million tons deadweight, rising to1-25 million tons later in the year. These figures include continued chartering of Canadian ships at about the current level throughout 1947.2. The calculations do not allow for abnormal delays on the scale whichhas recently been experienced (through exceptional delays in movement of cargcto loading ports, embargoes, and export licences). The calculations may alsoprove optimistic in the allowance for new buildings, since deliveries of ships are already delayed. On the other hand, cargo may fall short of the target of40 million tons.3. The estimates for 1948 are based on a United Kingdom import pro-gramme of 45 million tons, with more or less the same assumptions as to tonnageavailabilities. The conclusions as to the position in 1948 are assumed to holdgood in 1949. Estimates of the demands upon tonnage and the performance of ships so far ahead are guesswork, and any figures can only be taken as abroad guide.4. On the above basis our net forward position against requirements,assuming we were able to retain all of the United States and Canadian bareboatcharters, would show a small deficiency of tonnage in the first half of 1947, dis-appearing later in the year as the factors improving our tonnage availabilitycome into play (e.g., new buildings, more economical voyages, &amp;c), so that there might be a small surplus of tonnage over minimum requirements from that timeonwards.5. But we have to start re-delivering the Canadian bareboat chartered ships in 1948 and complete it in 1949, and we must expect to be obliged to startre-delivering United States bareboats in 1947. If we could spread re-delivery ofUnited States tonnage from mid-1947 till the end of 1949, our net forwardtonnage position could be stated thus :- Million tons deadweight.1947. 1948. 1949.First Half.    Second Half.-0-5 Balance. -0-8 -2-46. If we are to purchase any American bareboat chartered ships, by pur-chasing at once we save bareboat charter hire, but such purchases will only affectthe number we ultimately have to re-deliver. The purchase of 75 &quot; Sams &quot; and&quot;Forts,&quot; plus &quot;Baltic&quot; Coasters and some &quot;Hickories,&quot; would re-adjust theposition shown above to the extent of reducing the deficiency in 1949 to 2 million tons.7. An immediate purchase of 50 additional oceangoing American ships would readjust the net position in 1948 and further improve it in 1949 a^follows : Million tons deadtveight.1947. 1948. 1949.First Half.     Second Half.Balance +0-5 -0-3 -1-58. Deficiencies of this order might be said to be manageable to the extent that they can be re-adjusted somewhat by spreading the re-deliveries into 1950 andhaving regard to the variables in our estimates for the later years.
B. The Manning Problem.9. We have to redeliver .3 - 8 million tons of shipping at present manned with british crews, within the next 3 years, and our new buildings for United Kingdomowners during the same period might amount to 2-7 million deadweight tons.The loss of opportunity for employment at sea, represented by the difference,cannot be wholly eliminated but we can reduce it by buying a proportion of theAmerican bareboat chartered tonnage.I10. The proposed purchase of 50 ships forthwith, in addition to the bareboatchartered ships, represents a net immediate gain in the employment opportunities for our seamen. I am advised that there should be no difficulty in manning the extra ships, except perhaps as regards certificated engineers.C. Effect on Building Prospects in the United Kingdom.11. At first sight the purchase of an American ship represents the loss ofan order in our yards. Over-buying of American ships would certainly affectadversely the prospects of orders for United Kingdom yards; but the converseis not true that if we buy none the British yards will be so much the better off.12. Our estimates of our tonnage resources have included new buildings tobe delivered from our yards for United Kingdom owners. Our yards could not possibly replace for United Kingdom owners the whole of the bareboat charteredtonnage concurrently with its redelivery even if every new building could beregarded as a replacement of a redelivered bareboat chartered ship. building in the United Kingdom yards must over the next 5 years cover to some extentreplacement of obsolete ships.13. There is no fear that purchases of United States ships on the scale proposed will reduce the amount of shipping that should be built in our yardsfor British order in the next two or three years below what the industry can produce at current rates of production; on the contrary, we shall need every shipour owners can get from British yards to fill our gaps. The purchases of UnitedStates ships are necessary to enable our shipping industry to maintain its com-petitive position immediately; if this is not done, the long-term prospects of our shipping and shipbuilding will be impaired.14. It is proposed that the 50 additional ships to be purchased from theUnited States should be bought by His Majesty&apos;s Government and bareboatchartered for 3 to 5 years to United Kingdom owners. Of our Government-owned ships so far disposed of, 63 of the oceangoing types have been bareboatchartered for a period of 3 to 5 years as against 223 sold outright.D. British and World Tonnage at the End of 1949.15. It is relevant to our immediate decisions to try to forecast the Britishand world tonnage situation at the end of 1949.16. At the end of 1946 United Kingdom tonnage of ships over 1,600 tons(excluding tankers and excluding all foreign bareboat chartered ships) will bebarely over 13 million deadweight tons. By the end of 1949 we shall have addedby new buildings something between 2-g and 3 million deadweight tons at the outside. Against this we have to allow for loss of tonnage through the normalcauses of marine losses, obsolescence, &amp;c. While no doubt every effort will be:made to keep ships in service while freights are good, we have to set against this the accumulation of such efforts throughout the war and we must expect the rate of obsolescence in the latter part of the period to be higher than theaverage. However, allowing an average rate of loss and the maximum amountof new building, we might expect by the end of 1949 to have increased thefigure of 13 million tons to something over 15 million tons deadweight. Purchaseson the scale proposed from the United States or Canada would bring our tonnageat the end of 1949 to over 16-5 million deadweight tons. Our figure on the3rd September, 1939, was 17-2 deadweight tons.I 17. In estimating the world tonnage figures the major factors are theamount of American tonnage that may be expected to be available for employmentin 1949; and the future of our ex-enemies as maritime Powers.
18. As regards American tonnage it will be prudent to assume that thefleet operating under the American flag for overseas trade at the end of 1949 willbe 50 per cent, greater than in 1939. A substantial amount of the American war-built tonnage will be operated under other flags as well as our own.19. Of the ex-enemy Powers, Germany will be adding nothing to hermerchant fleet; Japan may be adding something and Italy will also be rebuildingher shipping. From these sources there will be little in total by way of additionto the world&apos;s tonnage resources.20. Other maritime Powers will increase their tonnage from new buildings at about the same rate as our own.21. On these assumptions world tonnage available for trading (i.e., excludingUnited States shipping in &quot; reserve &quot;) would be 57 million deadweight tons atthe end of 1949. In 1939 the equivalent figure was 62 million, but the 1949fleet will on the average be faster and more efficient.22. No one can estimate now with accuracy the demand for shipping in1949, but tonnage of the volume estimated above is not likely to be seriously outof proportion to demand.
