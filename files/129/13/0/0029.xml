this document is the property op his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1946.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.   It is issued for the personal use of top SECRET Copy No.CP. (46) 379.14 A October, 1946.CABINET.INQUIRY INTO THE PRESS.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.AT their meeting on the 3rd October (CM. (46) 84th Conclusions, Item 2),the Cabinet invited me, after consultation with the President of the Board ofTrade and the Lord Chancellor, to submit a note setting out the suggested termsof reference and membership of the proposed Royal Commission on the Press,together with a statement of the Commission^ powers to obtain evidence. Inaccordance with this decision, I have consulted the President of the Board ofTrade and the Lord Chancellor, and we have had the benefit of the assistance ofthe Minister of Health and the Minister of Labour.(1) Terms of reference.We came to the conclusion that it was desirable that the terms of reference should give some indication of the particular aspects of the problem which werecausing concern and were the immediate occasion for the inquiry, and we suggestterms of reference as follows :  With the object of furthering the free expression of opinion through thePress, to inquire into the control, management and ownership of the news-paper and periodical press and the news agencies, including the financial structure and the monopolistic tendencies in control, and to make recommendations thereon.(2) Composition.(a) Chairmanship.In view of the objections to inviting a Judge to preside over the inquiry,we thought that it would be wise to abandon the idea of having a Judge forthis purpose. It is, however, as I have already pointed out, of the utmost importance that the Chairman shall command public confidence. The namewhich occurred to us as being most suitable was that of Sir Hector Hetherington,the Vice-Chancellor of Glasgow University, who, apart from other qualifications,is a man with great experience of Governmental inquiries.(b) Other Members.As with the Chairmanship, the aim should be to secure competent personswho will command confidence, and it is desirable that persons drawn from scotland, Wales and the Provinces should be included; there should be at least one woman.I should have liked myself to include some Members of Parliament, because i think that they would have a useful contribution to make.  My colleagues felt,[32530]
however, that if active politicians were amongst the members, it would beimpossible to exclude party politics from the proceedings of the Commission,and I agree that this objection is substantial. Similarly, despite the advantages of having persons with inside knowledge of the newspaper world, we concluded that, while there need be no bar on occasional contributors to the Press and persons who have severed their connection with it, it would be inadvisable to puton the Commission anybody who was professionally engaged in newspapermanagement, journalism, &amp;c.We had a talk about possible members for the Commission, and I attach a list of the names which occurred to us as making up a suitable team. This listis quite tentative, and our colleagues may have alternative names to suggest. Itmay, however, serve as an indication of the kind of body which we have in mind.It is, of course, of the utmost importance that there should be no leakage of anyof the names on the list; any leakage could not fail to make it more difficult forus to get together a suitable membership.(3) Poivers of Royal Commissions.I attach (Annex II) a note on the powers of Royal Commissions, which isbased upon information supplied to me by the Home Secretary.H. M.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,Uth October, 1946.ANNEX I.Possible Names for Consideration.Sir   Hector   Hetherington :    Vice-Chancellor   of   Glasgow   University(Chairman).Michael Balcon : Film producer.Sir Sam Brown : Solicitor.George Chester : Trade Unionist.The Bishop of Coventry.A. S. Frere: Formerly Director of Public Relations, Ministry of Labour,and now a publisher.G. M. Garro-Jones.Sir Philip Morris : Vice-Chancellor of Bristol University.Harold Nicholson.Miss Eirwen Owen :  Formerly Deputy Regional Commissioner for Wales.J. B. Priestley.Sir George Schuster.W. H. Thompson : Solicitor.George Wansbrough.Metfoad Watkins : Director of John Lewises.ANNEX II.Powers of Royal Commissions.I find, on consulting the Home Secretary, that there is no fixed rule as to giving Royal Commissions power to call for persons, papers and records, but thatit is fairly common practice to include in the Royal Warrant setting up theCommission a clause as follows : &quot; We do give and grant unto you, or any three or more of you, full powerto call before you such persons as you shall judge likely to afford you any information upon the subject of this Our Commission; and also to call for,have access to and examine all such books, documents, registers and recordsas may afford you the fullest information on the subject, and to inquire ofand concerning the premises by all other lawful ways and means whatsoever.&quot;
Examples, in the last twenty years or so, of Warrants containing a formulaof this kind are the Royal Commissions on Honours, 1922; Lunacy and MentalDisorders, 1924; Transport, 1928; Police Powers and Procedure, 1928; Licensing(England and Wales), 1929; Civil Service, 1929; Labour in India, 1929; Lotteriesand Betting, 1932; Despatch of Business at Common Law, 1934; Private Manu-facture and Trading in Arms, 1935; Safety in Coal Mines, 1935 and IndustrialPopulations, 1937.There is no record in the Home Office of any difficulty, in recent years, in securing compliance with a request made by a Royal Commission under the clausequoted above, and it would seem that any questions which may have arisen wereresolved by the tact and discretion of the Chairman and members of the Corn-mission, and by the recognition by those concerned that it is loyal and dutiful to respond to a request made by a body appointed by The King under the Royal SignManual.The Home Secretary points out, however, that provisions of this kind in a royal Warrant are illusory to the extent that, in the last resort, there is nomeans of enforcing them unless they are based on a statutory enactment, either the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, or legislation ad hoc. An example of the Act of 1921 being applied&apos; to a Royal Commission is the case of theCommission on Lunacy and Mental Disorders.The possibility of an adverse situation arising was apparently foreseen inthe case of the Royal Commission on the Private Manufacture of and trading in Arms. Here, Mr. Ramsay MacDonald stated, in reply to a parliamentary question of the 18th February, 1935, that it would be a great mistake to begin to assume, by the special power given to the Commission, that they were goingto have any trouble in getting witnesses and their evidence. &quot; The Governmentmeant, however, to give the Commission full support for the discharge of their duties .... To begin with the Commission would not have the power to take evidence on oath : it was not a power given to Royal Commissions except in special circumstances. If there was any impediment that the Chairman foundin his lack of being able to administer an oath to a witness he only had tocommunicate with the Government, and it would be removed. Documentsbelonging to Government Departments would not be produced if those dtepart-ments pleaded privilege .... The Commission had power to ask for papers and it was left to the discretion of the Commission how that power was to beapplied and operated.&quot;In brief, therefore, the position is that it would&apos; be consistent with practice to include the clause in the Warrant, but that it would not be open to the RoyalCommission to administer an oath to witnesses, and that if any person summoned to attend or produce documents declined to do so, there would be no means ofcompelling him short of obtaining Resolutions in both Houses under the act of 1921 or of promoting separate legislation.
