OKaJUvrH).....I (Q......At..5I.&amp;v- -/d3(THIS DOCUMENT ISTHE PROPEIiTY OFGOVERNMENT)HISBRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SSECRETCP.(46) 56150th September 1946 COPY NOCABINETINDIAN FOOD REO,UIM-&apos;I/iENTSMemorandum bv the Secretary of State for india regret that I must yet once more bring the Indianfood situation to the notice of my colleagues.    Since theCabinet last reviewed the position on 9th September thesituation has deteriorated disastrously owing to theshipping strike in the United States and to a failure toobtain export licences from the Argentine Government forany -further supplies.     A memorandum explaining theposition in detail is annexed.     It is now exacted thatthe average of Government-held stocks in India will atthe end of October sink to - less than four weeks&apos; offtakeand to less than three weeks&apos; off take at the end ofNovember as compared with the Government of India&apos;sestimated minimum requirement of six weeks&apos; off take toprevent breakdowns in rationing.      It is estimated thatin order to keep Government-held stocks at five weeks&apos;&apos; off take it would be necessary for arrivals to beincreased by 213,000 tons in October or 333?000 tonsover October/November in addition to those in sight.It is difficult to see how famine conditions extending over wide areas can be averted in October, November and early December.     Any recrudescence of shipping strikes in the United states would -make the position even grimmer.2.   - As I see it, the only remaining possibility ofmaterially alleviating this disastrous situation would bethe early diversion to India (as already suggested in my previous memorandum C.P.(46) 328 of 2nd September) ofa substantial quantity, say 100,000 tons, of canadian wheat out of shipments at present destined for theUnited Kingdom.     I would urge most earnestly that from thepoint of view of our future relations with an independentIndia, it would be well worth while for the United kingdom to take this course even at the cost of some domesticsacrifice,     I must again emphasise the very grave(I political repercussions which would inevitably resultIj in/India if H.M.G. should decide in the near futureI to abolish bread, rationing in this country at a time when millions in India will be facing starvation.    The,f inference inevitably drawn by Indians from such action wouldbe that though it was in our power to help India materiallywe have been unwilling to do so: and this would hove amost embittering effect on our future relations with India.

India, Office,30th September, 1946.There is also the consideration that readiness onour part and on that of the Canadians to divert someOctober sailings of Canadian wheat to India would belikely to encourage the Americans to maximise the shipment of grain from the U.S. A. to India in October.&apos;3.     Apart from the diversion to India of Canadiansupplies I also suggest that the Embassy at washington should be asked to impress on the United StatesGovernment the importance of giving every possiblepriority to shipments of cereals to India.P.-L.

THE INDIAN FOOD situation the recent shipping strike in the United States andthe failure of the Indian Food Delegation to the Argentineto obtain export permits for the balance of about 130,000tons of Argentine cereals purchased by the Government ofIndia have very gravely affected the Indian food situation.Stocks of cereals likely to be available to the authoritiesin India for meeting the ration in the deficit Provincesduring the next three months are now estimated the figures being in thousands of tons.and states as followsOpeningstocksat begin-ning ofmonthInternalsuppliesduringmonthImp-ortsduringmonthTotalsupp-liesMonthlyofftakeClosingstocksOctoberNovemberDecember8005624431552166002913501 ,d,1,1246684685562ICS &apos;weekssf off-2.     It will be recalled that the Government of Indiaestimate that at least six weeks&apos; stocks are required inorder to prevent local breakdowns In the rationing system.The average weekly off take in India against the ration isabout 155,000 tons.   On the basis therefore of the above figures average stocks at the beginning of October will amount to a little over five weeks&apos; off take (775,000 tons)but will be reduced to between three and four weekofftake on 1st November and to less than threetake (465,000 tons) on 1st December.   This disastrousposition is almost entirely attributable to the sharpdecline in expected arrivals of United States wheat andArgentine maize in October and more especially in November.It should also be emphasised that the figure of 350,000 tons estimated for arrivals in November assumes that about100,000 tons of cereals can be snipped from the UnitedStates between the time when the strike ended and themiddle of October so as to reach India before the end ofNovember.   Very little of this has been shipped up to date and it is extremely doubtful if this target can be attained.The gap between estimated supplies available to the Indianauthorities and the amount required to bringstocks up to a level of five weeks&apos; offtakewidened to 213,000 tons at the end. of October and to333,000 tons at the end of November.averageQ now&quot;has3.     Cases of inability on the part of the authoritiesin India to meet the ration in full have recently been increasing, especially in Southern India, and it has alsobeen necessary in the rice eating areas to make all-roundreductions in the rice content of the 12 oz. cerealsration, for example from 12 ounces to 7i ounces a day in

Bengal and from 10 ounces to 3 ounces a day in Madras.In Travancore the basic cereals ration is now 9 ounces aday, of which only 4i ounces can be drawn in rice.   Itis reported that in Bengal stocks will fall on 1stNovember to 20,000 tons of rice and 50,000 tons ofwheat against an estimated monttily&quot;&quot;o ftake from government stocks of 125-y000 tons.   The Government---ofIndia have told the Government of Bengal that it is no-tpossible to augment their supplies from outside theProvince,  during October and November and chat-theironly hopta lies in the maximum procurement from the Bengalaus rice crop which is now coming to market.   This cropis subsidiary to the main winter (aman) rice crop andis normally consumed locally in the distriots.   TheGovernment of India are quite-definite that unless&apos;further steps can be taken to increase imports, a breakdown in food distribution over wide areas in &quot;India,in the latter half of October and in November cannot be averted..4.     The following is the present position in regardto supplies-es of cereals for India from various sourceswhich seem to call for detailed comment:--(a) canadian  addition to the four cargoes of Canadian wheaton the Pacific Coast originally intended for the UnitedKingdom which have been released by the Ministry of Food,for shipment to India in return for an equivalentquantity of wheat provided by Canada in the St. Lawrencefor shipment to the united Kingdom, the Government ofIndia have been able to arrange United Statesshipping for two further cargoes of Canadian wheat from -the&quot;St. &quot;Lawrence.   It is hoped that all six cargoes,amounting to about 53,000 tons, will reach india during November,(b) United states the balance from programmes of United States wheat and other cereals, originally intended for shipment toIndia in September or earlier months but remainingunshipped when the strike ended, amounted to about275,000 tons.    It is impossible to estimate at presentaccurately what proportion of this amount can now be shipped in time to reach India before the end ofNovember but it is unlikely to exceed 100,000 tons.(c) UNRRAOwing to the strike UNRRA&apos;s offer of 25,000 tonsof United States wheat for November arrival has lapsed.UNRRA has offered instead 25,000 tons of barley which theMinistry of Food have bought in the Argentine and were

intending to hand over to UN.RRA in repayment of a loan.This offer is being investigated.(d) australia the Government of India have appealed to theAustralian Government through the Indian High commissioner at Canberra for increased shipments of wheat or flour.Judging however from the reply received from theAustralian Government to a similar appeal on behalf ofIndia which was recently made to them through theDominions Office, it is unlikely that the Australians willbe able to assist, owing to drought in Queensland,difficulties of internal transport and the requirementsof New Zealand-(e) ArgentinaThe Indian Food Delegation were successful inobtaining export permits from the Argentine Governmentfor about 140,000 tons of maize and other cereals, and shipping has been arranged to enable all this to arrive in India before the end of November.   But export permitshave not yet been obtained for the remaining 130,000 tonsof grain bought by the Government of mdia and in any case it is probably too late now for shipping to be arranged to bring any further quantity to-India by the end ofNovember.(f) JavaH. M. Go recently agreed, despite the objections ofSACSEA, to the supply to the Indonesians of 2003-ton lorries and coal for the purpose of acceleratingthe movement of paddy to Indonesian held ports for export to India.   But owing to the delay there has been on this issue and the difficulty &quot;of shipping lighters toIndonesian ports, it is not possible to assume anysubstantial increase in arrivals in India before december.(g) Siam and BurmaIn present circumstances not more than about,20,000 tons&quot; of rice per month can be expected by india from these sources.   The responsible British authoritiesare doing what they can to improve the situation.5.     It is too late to take any&apos; steps which couldmaterially affect the position in India in October.   Butthe position in November will be even worse than inOctober and the period of acute crisis in India willcontinue into December.   The following appear to be theonly possibilities of alleviating the situation:-

o 0(a) To arrange for more wheat to be shipped from canada to India for November or early December arrival,say 100,000 tons oresujp.ab.Iy by diversion of supplies atpresent destined for the United Kingdom,   it isunderstood that more than 600,000 tons of wheat havebeen programmed for shipment from Canada during October,mostly to the United Kingdom.(b) To make a diplomatic approach to the UnitedStates Government on the lines suggested in paragraph (v) of she enclosure to ft P. (46)328 urging that every possible priority should be given to the shipment of UnitedStates cereals already allocated to India and the grantof a further generous allocation to India by the UnitedStates for shipment in October.   The Indian FoodRepresentative at Washington has already pointed outboth to the Canadians and the Americans the desperateposition in which India will find herself in Novemberbut their reactions have not been very encouraging.   the americans apparently think that Canada is programmingher exports with a view to her post-war trade&apos;and leaving the United States to carry alone the burden of relief for famine-stricken countries.   Tae Indian Foodrepresentative at WasMngiori considers that a fewshipments from Canada to India in oarlyJ3ctobar wouldinfluence the Americans a good deal In india!s favourand convince them of her need,   if the proposal at(a) above is adopted, KM. iiimbassy at Washington couldpress the more forcibly on the-staps Department thedesirability of the U, 8. A. making a substantial contribution.
