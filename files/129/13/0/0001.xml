Cca&quot; (LvJlsxAJisi   SU.C,This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentPrinted for the Cabinet, September, 1946SECRET a/.Copy No. Oicp. (46) 35124th September, 1946.CABINETCLOTHING AND  TEXTILES  FOR  THE  services memorandum BY THE  PARLIAMENTARY UNDER SECRETARYOF STATE FOR WAR1. I feel that Ministers may wish me to comment on the proposals made by thePresident of the Board of Trade in CP. (46) 348 on the subject of clothing and textilesfor the Services.2. Coupons for Civilian Clothing.I have noted with appreciation the decision to issue 21 coupons a year to other ranks.3. Pyjamas and Handkerchiefs.I do not think it proper or healthy that in peace the soldier should have to sleep inhis underclothing. The Army draws its recruits from the whole gamut of the socialscale and should not require them to adopt a standard lower than that to which theymay have become accustomed and which it is an aim to secure for all. I ask, therefore,for confirmation in principle that pyjamas should be a normal issue. Nevertheless, Irecognize the difficulties facing the President of the Board of Trade and, in view of theoffer by the President to raise the issue of clothing coupons to the soldier from 21 to 30a year, I agree to this project being deferred. But I request that the necessity for itsimplementation at the earliest practicable moment be recognized and that the questionbe reconsidered at latest in a year&apos;s time.4. Sheets.Here again, I think it important to establish in principle the necessity of an issueof sheets. Before the war the soldier was provided with sheets which on hygienic groundswere regarded as being as essential in his case as for the ordinary civilian. Moreover,it must be remembered that the British soldier is a British citizen and he should havehis share of whatever is available to the civil population. But, in view of the situationrepresented by the President, I am prepared to agree that, subject to the preservation ofexisting special entitlement, e.g., for hospitals, the full provision of the Army&apos;s require-ments should be deferred for a year, as he proposes, provided that:  (a) on grounds of hygiene and morale, sheets for the Army are recognized as an urgent requirement which should be met at the earliest practicable moment;(b) all married soldiers receive comparable treatment with civilians in the issue ofdockets for sheets;(c) single soldiers get comparable treatment with civilians to the extent that theArmy receives from now onwards its due proportion, vis a vis the civilian population, of the net availability of sheets after the needs of priority classeshave been met.5. Walking-out dress for the Army.Considerable publicity has been given to the new walking-out dress and the army has been led to expect its appearance within a reasonable time. The Financial Secretaryto the War Office informed the Plouse of Commons on 9th July, 1946, that arrangements would be made to show it to Members of the House. A dress of similar pattern andcolour has been worn by the Recruiting Column which has now almost completed itstour of the country. As the Treasury are aware, a sum of money stands in estimates for this provision.
2As I understand it, the Presidents proposal is not merely to postpone the issue fora year or so, but to abandon the project indefinitely. If this were done, the effect on recruiting and on the morale of the Army of what might well be regarded as a breach of faith would be serious. Incidentally, it would cast doubt on all the other promises,e.g., of better accommodation and conditions generally, which have been made both to attract recruits and to improve morale. It would give the potential recruit no hope of having anything smarter and more presentable to wear than battle-dress which is naturally unpopular for peace-time wear and compares unfavourably with the presentdress of the other Services. Experience has shown that an attractive uniform is an aid to recruiting and it has real importance from the point of view of national prestige in overseas commands. Anything likely to impair public confidence in the Army&apos;s ability to achieve the improvements already announced in the soldier&apos;s way of life would have serious consequences.But I realize the force of the case presented by the President, and I am anxious tofind some way both of assisting him and of overcoming the formidable difficulties of abandoning this project, which I have set out above. I had hoped that 500,000 yards of cloth would be available by August, 1947, and thereafter the same amount every4 months.I appreciate that this would represent a heavy call upon capacity but I ask theCabinet to approve provision at some less rate, which might be 250,000 yards at months&apos; intervals. This would at least provide evidence of our intention to carry out what the public has been led to expect.N. of C.The War Office,24th September, 1946.(B46/13)   no   9/46   W.O.P.   26498
