B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,23rd September, 1946.Note.I. In troduc tion.The question of the disposal of the Italian colonies was last considered by theCabinet in April 1946 (CP. (46) 165 of the 18th April, 1946). My purpose inthis paper is to summarise the position reached as a result of subsequent nego-tiations within the Council of Foreign Ministers about Libya and to make proposals for future policy with particular reference to that territory.2. On the 28th May, 1946, I proposed in the Council of Foreign ministers that the whole of Libya should be given independence. This was unacceptable tothe other Delegations, but in the course of subsequent discussions the Sovietwithdrew its claims to Tripolitania and gave support to the French proposal thatall the Italian colonies should be returned to Italy. Since the United states delegation seemed likely to support this view, at least in regard to Tripolitania,I put in a claim that Cyrenaica should be placed under United Kingdom trustee-ship. It was finally decided that the various proposals should be referred to the deputies for further examination.13571   [32421]
3. The Deputies made no useful progress but a compromise was reached onthe basis of a United States proposal that the whole problem should be deferred fora year. An article was therefore agreed by the four Foreign Ministers for inclusion in the Draft Peace Treaty with Italy, which reads : &quot; Section III.Article 17.1. Italy renounces all right and title to the Italian territorialpossessions in Africa, i.e., Libya, Eritrea and Italian Somaliland.2. Pending their final disposal, the said possessions shall continueunder their present administration.3. The final disposal of these possessions shall be determined jointly bythe Governments of the U.S.S.R., United States, United Kingdom andFrance within one year of the coming into force of the present Treaty, in themanner laid down in the joint declaration of [date] issued by the saidGovernments.&quot;The agreed text of this draft Declaration reads :  &quot; 1. The Governments of U.S.S.R., United States, United Kingdomand France agree that they will, within one year from the coming into forceof the Peace Treaty with Italy bearing [date], jointly determine the finaldisposal of Italy&apos;s territorial possessions in Africa, to which, in accordance,with Article      of the Treaty, Italy renounces all right and title.2. The final disposal of the territories concerned and the appropriateadjustment of their boundaries shall be made by the Four Powers in thelight of the wishes and welfare of the inhabitants and the interests of peace and security, taking into consideration the views of other interested governments.3. If in respect to any of these territories the Four Powers are unableto agree upon their disposal within one year from the date of the cominginto force of the present Treaty, the matter shall be referred to the general assembly of the United Nations for a recommendation, and the four powers agree to accept the recommendation and to take appropriate measures for giving effect to it.4. The Deputies of the Foreign Ministers shall continue the considera-tion of the question of the disposal of the former Italian Colonies witha view to submitting to the Council of Foreign Ministers their recom-mendations on this matter. They shall also send out commissions of investigation to any of the former Italian Colonies in order to supply the deputies with the necessary data on this question and to ascertain the viewsof the local population.&quot;4.   The reasons which prompted me to agree to this course were : (i) No agreement which would satisfy our requirements was in sight.(ii) Our strategic requirements in Cyrenaica are to some extent dependenton the outcome of our negotiations with Egypt and the delay might enable us to estimate these requirements more precisely.(iii) A year&apos;s delay would provide the Council of Foreign Ministers withthe opportunity of obtaining a closer acquaintance with the problemsof these colonies and this was likely to be to our advantage. A betterappreciation of the facts of the situation might prevent settlement ina manner likely to disturb our relations with the Arab States and ethiopia in the future. In Cyrenaica, where our main interests lie,the people have expressed themselves since 1940 in favour of a con-tinued association with the United Kingdom. It would be to our advantage for the Council of Foreign Ministers, through the corn-missions of investigation mentioned in the proposed Declaration, tobe informed of this by the people themselves.II. Objectives.5. Our main aims in negotiating a settlement for the Italian Colonies were summarised in paragraph 25 of CP. (46) 165 of the 18th April, 1946, asfollows : &quot; (a) To arrive at a settlement which satisfies the interests of imperialdefence;
(&amp;) to prevent the Russians gaining ,control of any one of the colonies,and to reduce to a minimum their share in any international arrange-ments and their opportunities for interference;(c) to sponsor a settlement which will meet, to the fullest extent practicable,the needs and wishes of the inhabitants of the ex-Italian colonies,i.e. : (i) self-government for Libya;(ii) a united Somalia;(iii) the fusion of the major part of Eritrea (i.e., excluding the moslem area) with Ethiopia;(d) to secure United States support.&quot;6. So far we have succeeded in eliminating Russia&apos;s direct claims and it ismy belief that they will not be renewed. Progress has also been made in obtainingUnited States support. This has not yet been clearly expressed, but the UnitedStates Delegation is now beginning to appreciate that international trusteeshipfor all the colonies is not practicable and is therefore more disposed to consider proposals for separate solutions for the various colonies according to their individual requirements.7. At the same time developments which have occurred since last April havemade it necessary to reconsider objectives (c) (i) and (ii) in paragraph 5 above. Inthis paper I confine my remarks to Libya only.III. Policy.8. It has become increasingly evident that finding a solution for the Libyanproblem is a matter of great difficulty and importance. Its geographicalimportance in relation to Imperial Defence needs no emphasis and the Chiefs ofStaff have recently stressed the strategic importance of Cyrenaica as a result ofthe trend of negotiations for a revision of the Egyptian Treaty. At the sametime, the position of Libya as a disputed frontier between Europe and the arab states makes it difficult to find a solution which will satisfy our military require-ments, the interests of Italy and France, Libyan nationalism, and the regionalclaims of the Arab States.9. In view of these difficulties I consider that for our immediate purposesit would be wise to treat the two parts of Libya separately, on the assumptionthat separate solutions will be found for them.   My reasons are as follows: (i) There are great difficulties in negotiating independence or a Britishtrusteeship for the whole of Libya. Italy has enlisted the support ofvarious Powers, including Russia, for her claim to a future interestin Tripolitania. France, particularly, will resist the extension ofan independent Arab sphere to the frontiers of Tunisia.(ii) There is fairly general acceptance of the United Kingdom&apos;s special interest in Cyrenaica.(iii) It is probable that the people of Cyrenaica would be willing to seek aseparate settlement for their country if they realised that by linkingtheir case with Tripolitania the prospects of gaining autonomy werediminished.10. I recommend, therefore, that as our immediate aim we should nowconcentrate on securing a British trusteeship for Cyrenaica, so drafted as togive us the necessary strategic facilities, and leading up to independence afterten years, with an extension if necessary by agreement with United nations organisation.11. The difficult problem of the future of Tripolitania will require further study.12. If this policy is adopted it is essential to ensure the good-will of thepeople of Cyrenaica and their leader, El Sayed Mohammed Idris el Senussi.During the past five years very friendly relations have been established, butthe administrative arrangements in Cyrenaioa have remained of a ratherprovisional nature. This was partly because there was some doubt as to howfar our hands were tied under The Hague Convention, and partly because it was felt that there was insufficient justification for incurring substantial capitalexpenditure so long as the territory&apos;s future was undecided. The prolongation-tion of the period of occupation has now given the more politically-minded Arabsthe opportunity to criticise the unprogressive nature of our administration in
the hope that we shall thereby be led to commit ourselves in advance to giving them the independence they seek.13.   In my opinion action under the following heads should now be taken :  (i) El Sayed Idris el Senussi is the acknowledged leader of the people, aswell as of the Senussi religious sect, and it was he who in January1942 was thanked by name by Mr. Eden for the assistance which hehad given during the Western Desert campaign. He should be awarded an honorary K.B.E., and the Military Administration should bring into use the title of Emir in its honorific application.(ii) From the beginning of the occupation the Military Administration hasadopted a policy of training the Arabs to bear more administrative responsibility, with the result that some 500 Libyan Arabs areemployed in the Civil Service as compared with 80 foreigners, nearly all from Middle Eastern countries, who fill only those posts for which local men lack the technical qualifications. The promotion of Arabsto fill more responsible posts should now be accelerated, althoughexecutive authority will have to remain in the hands of the military administration and the Arab officials will continue to be employedby that Administration.(iii) The Military Administration has already appointed local advisory councils in both municipal and rural areas in Cyrenaica. The time has now come for the appointment of an advisory council for the whole country under the chairmanship of Sayed Idris. The terms ofreference of this council must necessarily be restricted, but there isa useful role for it to fill as the body concerned primarily with studying the future administration of the country, and with the preparationof the Arab case for presentation to any visiting commission whichmay be sent out by the Council of Foreign Ministers.(iv) Cyrenaica has suffered heavily from war damage and disruption oftrade. Indeed, it is probable that to the majority of the inhabitantsthe financial restrictions involved by the &quot; Care and Maintenance&quot;policy are more irksome than the political. Further efforts to restorewar damage and to remedy the economic disabilities of the country arenecessary if the continued friendship of the people is to be ensured.(v) The Military Administrations in Libya, and in the Middle Eastgenerally, have suffered severely from wastage of experienced staff and urgent steps are necessary to rectify the situation. I hope that theColonial Office and the Sudan Government, and possibly also the IndiaOffice, will assist in this matter.(vi) The Chief Civil Affairs Officer, Middle East, has already prepared pro-posals on these administrative and financial matters, and I am anxiousto collaborate with the Secretary of State for War in appointing a working Party, under the eegis of the War Office, to visit Cyrenaica,for consultation on the spot, with a view to presenting His Majesty&apos;sGovernment with a comprehensive plan for dealing with (ii), (iii) and(iv) above.14. I hope that my colleagues will concur in these proposals. As explained,if the Peace Conference approves the recommendation agreed by the Council ofForeign Ministers, an International Commission will shortly be visiting theterritory to advise the Council of Foreign Ministers on its disposal. It is of greatimportance that, when this Commission arrives, it should find the inhabitantssatisfied with our administration and anxious to see our association with thefuture of their country continue. I consider that the administrative measures recommended above will materially contribute to this end.15. As regards Tripolitania, no change in administration is proposed atpresent. I hope, however, that a working party on the lines of that suggested forCyrenaioa will be able to visit this territory too, since a report from them would assist in the review of Tripolitanian problems which is required, and they could at the same time advise on&apos;the removal of certain economic discontents which have arisen.   Similar visits could also be made to Eritrea and Italian Somaliland.Foreign Office, 14j/j September, 1946.E. B.       (J
