(46) 383.17th October, 1946.CABINET.GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.THE economy of the British Zone has run down to an extremely seriousextent and is still deteriorating. To relieve the position a further capital investment will be necessary. The recovery of the Zone cannot be expected in under three years, and the investment may be as much as an additional 250 million above the monies already voted. The comparable figure for theAmerican Zone is  125 million.2. Last July a decision was taken to link the British and United StatesZones economically. The sharing of the financial liability was left to lateragreement, which has not yet been reached. The Americans are thinking in termsof approximately equal shares. We cannot afford anything like this. TheChancellor of the Exchequer has suggested to Mr. Clayton a ratio of 4 to 1 betweenthe United States and ourselves. I have informed Mr. Byrnes that we cannot accept anything approaching a fifty-fifty split.3. The heavy financial burden with which we are now faced is not theresult of the decision taken by the Cabinet last July to fuse the two Zoneseconomically. Indeed, unless we are prepared to treat our own Zone as a closedeconomy and sell to the United States Zone for dollars (a policy which was rejected by the Cabinet), fusion, even on a fifty-fifty basis, does not increase andmay reduce our financial burden.4. Provided the necessary capital can be found; a determined effort is madeto increase coal production, and sufficient coal is retained in Germany, the two zones should, over a period of years, be able to repay the money invested.5. I have agreed with Mr. Byrnes that discussions shall take place in washington during November, between officials of the two Governments and representatives of the two Control Commissions, with a view to finding a solution to the financial difficulties and agreeing on the short-term policies necessary toright the situation.6. These discussions should also cover long-term policy questions which will arise during the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers. Theprincipal matters upon which agreement is required, and the line of policy which our delegation should advocate, are as follows  (a) Treatment of Germany as an Economic Whole.We should insist on the Russians implementing the full terms of the potsdam Agreement, even though this may involve maintaining for sometime to come the practical separation of East and West Germany. If the americans wish to make concessions to Russia, it should be on the clear understanding that they bear any additional financial commitments that maybe involved.(b) Level of Industry.We should press for a substantial upward adjustment on the present plan, particularly in regard to steel.T32554] b19
;  (c) Reparations.At present the Americans are refusing any further allocation anddismantling of reparation plants. Future policy will have to be discussed atWashington and at the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting. Meanwhileindividual items of equipment urgently required in the United Kingdomand the other I.A.R.A. Powers should be removed from the British Zoneat once. If economic unity is not achieved in November, we should reserve.&apos;i all capital plant removed from Western Germany for the I.A.R.A. Powersexcept for the 15 per cent, deliverable under Potsdam to the Russians againstcounter-deliveries of an equivalent value.(d) Socialisation.Our policy must be to press forward with the socialisation of the heavy industries in Western Germany.7. The future constitutional structure of Germany should be on broaddecentralised lines with certain powers reserved to the centre, and the residueleft to the Lander. No central German Government should be set up until certainsafeguards have been agreed between the Controlling Powers.8. The remainder of the British Zone outside the Land North Rhine-Westphalia should be reorganised into two Lander, viz., Schleswig-Holstein and lower Saxony. Hamburg and Bremen should each be given an independent status outside these Lander.9. Nominated Governments should be set up as soon as possible in all theLander (and in Hamburg and Bremen) with instructions to draft constitutionsfor submission to their Parliaments as soon as these have been elected.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,17th October, 1946.Memorandum.Introduction.1. We have now reached another critical period with regard to our german policy, and it is necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to take certain decisions to carry us over the next stage. Two factors in particular have arisen whichaccentuate the urgency of the German problem.   These are : (a) The fact that a large capital investment will have to be made in theBritish Zone in Germany before it can reach a stage where it is notonly self-supporting but can begin to repay the money borrowed.(&amp;) A meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers on Germany is scheduledfor the end of November, to be followed later by a further meetingat which a number of major decisions, some of them highly con-controversial, will have to be taken.These two factors are closely linked particularly because the economic fusionbetween the British and United States Zones makes it necessary that we and the americans shall keep our policies as far as possible in step.2. This memorandum sets out my views and recommendations under thefollowing main heads : State of Economy of the British Zone : fusion with american Zone and its financial implications; suggested discussions in Washing-ton and their scope; and political questions upon which immediate decisions arerequired. \Section I.State of Economy of the British Zone and the Financial Commitment Involved.3. It is now nearly eighteen months since Germany, with her administra-tion in a state of complete collapse, accepted the Allied terms of unconditional surrender.   Since then great progress has been made in the recreation of an
administrative system and in the restoration of law and order, but our financial burden, instead of diminishing, will be increased before conditions of economic stability can be restored.  The main factors in the situation are : (a) Stocks.At the time of surrender considerable quantities of stocks of all kindsexisted in Germany. These have hitherto been available to supplementcurrent production, but the time is rapidly approaching, and has in certain cases already arrived, when stocks will be exhausted, and the essential import programme will have to include basic raw materials which are either notproduced in Germany or cannot be produced for the time being due to shortage of coal, power and labour.(b) Food.Western Germany has always been deficient in food-stuffs. Shortageof fertilisers during the war years has reduced pre-war yields substantially,and even to maintain the 1,550 calorie standards some 3 million tons ofwheat imports will be required for the Anglo-American Zone. Morefertilisers are being made available this year which should produce some increase in the harvest of 1947; the calorie standard, however, must beincreased as soon as possible abjout the 1,550 calorie level if the germans are to be given the means and incentive to work. There is no likelihoodtherefore of the food import bill being reduced below this figure for manyyears to come.(c) Coal.Under the Level of Industry Plan about 80 million tons of coal wouldbe needed in Western Germany to render her self-supporting on the basisof the &quot; average European standard of living.&quot; Although this implies agood deal higher standard than that at present in force (the normal con-sumer would receive about 1,000 calories more per day than at present)there are enormous arrears of plant maintenance to make good before thecoal consumption by industry can give an efficient yield. Thus, even onthe low living standards now in force some 40 million tons of coal a year are required in the British Zone alone to produce conditions of reasonableeconomic stability and probably 20 million tons in the United States Zone.These demands together are about 10 million tons per year in excess ofthe current production level of the combined zones, and allow nothing for exports which must take second place until our basic requirements havebeen met. If exports are to be maintained at 12 million tons, and certainquantities of coal made available to the French Zone, an increase of over50 per cent, in production must be achieved.(d) Basic Industries.The basic industries are closely interlocked and the lowering in efficiency of any one is affecting the others. It has not been possible with the coalavailable to reduce maintenance needs in these industries, and their con-dition is continually deteriorating. To take two examples : the coal industry itself required in pre-war years about 800,000 tons of steel to maintain it.The amount allocated during the war years was continuously reduced untilin the last year of the war rather less than 50 per cent, of its pre-war con-sumption in steel could be allotted to it. It is not possible to improve onthis percentage at the current rate of availability, and deterioration inequipment is therefore continuing at an accelerating pace. With regardto railway transport, on which the whole life of the country depends, theamount of steel available is also inadequate for its sustenance, and thenumber of railway wagons in use is being reduced in the British Zone ata rate of approximately 500 per week. A similar state of affairs is occurringin the other basic industries, in particular in the output of electric power,metallurgical industries, fertilisers and in the production of food and agricultural requirements, all of which are interdependent.(e) Housing.The housing conditions in the British Zone are worse than in any other,and of 5^ million dwelling units only 3^ million are now habitable. Recon-struction and replacement of the balance is dependent on coal availability[325541 B 2
for the manufacture of building materials. By reducing coal allocations to steel, fertilisers and various secondary industries an increased allocation to the building industries has recently been made. But even so there isno overall improvement in accommodation per head of population owingto the influx of refugees. This shortage -renders labour extremely immobile&quot; and prevents its attraction and diversion and the concentration of output in efficient plants.(f) Manpower.The inadequacy of food and other consumer goods has not only reduced the man-hour output to about 50 per cent, of the pre-war level but resultedin a high rate of absenteeism. In the coal mining industry, notwithstanding the drive that is being made to improve its status, it is proving difficult toincrease the labour force or to reduce absenteeism. The position here isaggravated by the heavy destruction of houses in the Ruhr.(g) Currency.Lack of confidence in the currency has reduced the normal monetaryattraction of work and is leading to the hoarding of what small quantitiesof consumer goods are available in the Zone.(h) Prices and Wages.Adjustments are necessary in the wage/price situation. certain categories of workers are hard put to it to obtain a livelihood from theirexisting wages while the majority of producers are being forced &quot;to work at a loss.(i) Summary.Each of these factors contributes to Germany&apos;s present state, and eachaggravates the others. Because less coal is available less food is produced;less food means less coal; and so on over the whole field. The process ofdeterioration has long been going on and is now reaching a critical point.The last reserves are being drawn upon, and the working capital of germany is being daily used up and not replaced. For each month that the basicrequirements of German industry in the form of coal, steel and other materials are withheld, so that the primary equipment is worn away, three or four months are added to the period of recovery which must elapse before our Zone can be self-supporting again. This time lag will increaseprogressively if the steps necessary to arrest the decline are delayed.The Remedy.4z. The cure to the present position in Germany entails acceptance of thefollowing principles : (a) An increase in food rations as and when additional food becomes avail-able, with a view to providing the normal consumer, as soon aspossible, with a diet of 2,000 calories per day.(b) Giving to our drive to increase coal production the same priority as wouldbe given to an operation of war, including the import of pre-f abricatedhouses, consumer goods, and other commodities which, if made avail-able now, would reduce the time it would take to achieve our objective.(c) The retention in Germany from domestic  coal production of the quantities necessary to rehabilitate the basic industries.(d) The importation of substantial quantities of raw materials on whichthe basic and essential consumer industries depend.(e) Financial reform, which can give the Germans some confidence in thefuture value of the Mark.(/) Within the limitations imposed by security, to relax the present restric-tions on German trade as soon as possible. Subject to such limitationsGermans should be allowed to send and receive mail and telegrams,and be given facilities for foreign travel in order to. re-establish their commercial connections.5. The extent and period of the capital investment needed to achieve this programme depends primarily on the time it-will take to improve coal production.This will be no easy task, and although the potentialities are great it will be unwise to underestimate the difficulties.    More labour is needed;   housing
conditions must be improved; absenteeism must be reduced. A quadripartiteCommittee of Experts has recently drawn up a report on these and other measures necessary to increase coal output, and many of them have already been adopted(see Annex A). Even so it is likely to take at least a year before any large-scaleincrease in output is achieved. During this period German import requirements will rise and, if the necessary reduction in coal exports takes place, the moneyreceived on account of exports will be less. Even when the position of the basic industries has been restored there will still be a heavy import bill to meet for food, fertilisers and essential raw materials. The greater part of German output during this period will be needed to carry out arrears of maintenance and therewill be an inevitable time lag, in certain cases amounting to as much as a year,before raw and semi-finished materials can be converted into manufacturedgoods. The latter will then be required to an increasingly great extent withinGermany since by that time there will be an accumulated domestic consumerdemand which must receive attention.6. An estimate of the amount of money involved is now being prepared inBerlin. It will inevitably be subject to a wide margin of error; but it may wellshow that over the next three years the order of magnitude of the capital invest-ment needed to achieve a balance of payments in the British Zone may be as high as  250 million, over and above monies already voted. For the American Zonethe comparable figure might be  125 million.7. In spite of this gloomy picture the position is not hopeless. ProvidedGermany is given the necessary capital and the Level of Industry Plan is amendedwhere necessary to provide greater production margins both for internalconsumption and export, saleable goods will be produced of good, quality and atcompetitive prices. The capital must largely be provided by the Americans;the adjustment in the Level of Industry Plan should be capable of achievementsince Mr. Byrnes in his Stuttgart speech clearly indicated that the Morgan thanplan for a pastoral de-industrialised Germany no longer governs the Americanattitude towards this problem. Though the Germans are in a highly depressedstate at the present moment, they possess great natural skill and tenacity andplenty of resilience. Once they are made to feel that there is some future forthem they will settle down to work and should in due course produce a sufficientexportable surplus to repay over a period of years the loans they have received.Section II.Fusion with American Zone and its Financial Implications.8. During the July meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers I made, for political reasons and in order to bring matters to a head, a declaration to theeffect that, unless the economic unity of Germany became a reality, the british zone would be operated as an independent unit with a view to eliminating as rapidly as possible the burden now falling on the British taxpayer. I added thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to reciprocate with any other zonethat was ready to co-operate. Mr. Byrnes at the same meeting offered to operate the American Zone together with the zones of any or all of the other occupying powers as a single unit. Mr. Byrnes&apos;s proposal was considered by the Cabinetin July (see CP. (46) 292) and accepted, the financial implications of fusion being left for later agreement.9. Under the previous financial arrangements which are still operating, webear the whole cost of the imports into the British zone. We collect the proceeds of exports from the zone, but under an agreement made last year with the americans we are due to pool the export nroceeds of the two zones and dividethem m proportion to the cost of imports. As our zone exports much more thanthe American Zone, this agreement works to our disadvantage; it has not yet been implemented, but the Americans are pressing us to do so.10. Under the new arrangements which will come into force when theeconomic fusion of the two zones becomes fully operative, we and the americans will jointly bear the cost of the imports of the two zones, in proportions yet to beagreed, m so far as this is not covered by the proceeds of exports from the two zones.11. Fusion, in itself, will not change the basic conditions which have ledto the present heavy cost of the British Zone, though in the longer run it will be economically advantageous, and should tend to alleviate the burden.    The real
financial effect of fusion is that the charge which the taxpayer has to pay is nolonger the deficit of our zone but a proportion of the joint deficit to be fixed by negotiation with the United States.12. It is plain from the facts and figures quoted above that the prospectivedeficit of the British Zone, or even an equal share of the joint deficit of the two zones, (which should be a smaller sum), is beyond this country&apos;s capacity to pay.We shall have to ask the United States to bear much the larger share of the costof the common enterprise, as they have done in other cases, such as U.N.R.R.A.and the cost of civil affairs supplies.13. To persuade them, we can point to these precedents, to the facts of our financial position and to their own statement that they will not let the fusionbreak down for financial reasons. There is also a more specific argument. Atpresent, large quantities of coal, iron and steel are sent from the British to theAmerican Zone against payment in Reichsmarks only. The alternative to fusionis that we should organise our zone as a closed economy and charge dollars for those inter-zonal transactions. This would go some way towards balancing ourbudget, but was rejected by the Cabinet in July, as politically impossible. I hopethat.we shall not have to revert to this idea; but the fact that our zone does con-tribute so much to the American Zone is a strong argument in favour of theUnited States bearing a larger share.Section III.Discussions with Mr. Clayton and Mr. Byrnes.14. The seriousness of the economic situation in Western Germany, thefinancial commitment involved, and the sharing of the commitment between theBritish and United States Government were discussed recently by the Chancellorof the Exchequer with Mr. Clayton in Washington. Mr. Clayton was of theopinion that the burden should be borne in approximately equal proportions. TheChancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the formula used for U.N.R.R.A.(viz., about the proportion of 4 : 1) was the fair one to adopt in this matter.15. I had two interviews with Mr. Byrnes in Paris and emphasised to him the gravity of the financial position. I pointed out to him the need of a jointBritish-United States-German effort to rehabilitate the Ruhr industries as soonas possible and the help which America could give by supplying some of the equipment and goods needed by the mines and miners for this purpose. I saidthat there must be no bottlenecks and that the whole matter should be treatedas an operation of war. Mr. Byrnes agreed and we arranged for a team ofBritish officials to go to Washington to discuss all these matters with UnitedStates experts about the 12th November. My proposal is that the team from london should consist of representatives of the Foreign Office, the Control Officeand the Treasury, and that two or three members of the British Control Corn-mission from Berlin should go with them.Section IV.Scope of the Washington Discussions.A. -Finance.16,&apos; It should be the aim of our delegation to persuade the United StatesGovernment to bear as large a share as possible of the cost of the two zones.It is impossible, at this stage, to give them final instructions; we have not yetgot sufficient information about the total cost of the enterprise, and we shallhave to consider the matter again in the light of the American reactions. Butthey should start with the suggestion which the Chancellor of the Exchequermade to Mr. Clayton in Washington that the burden should be shared in the proportions of 4 to 1, which are suggested by the U.N.R.R.A. and civil affairsagreements.17. Our object should be to induce the Americans to enter into an open and published agreement with us which will settle our respective financialresponsibilities for the whole period of the operation. We must seek to avoidtheir backsliding half-way through the operation.
18. The Americans are likely to propose that part of the money shouldbe found by private capital or by bodies like the R.F.C. This will involve difficult questions of what priorities such investors should have on German exportsms--d-vis His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government.19. Our negotiators should, I suggest, be empowered to implement the oldagreement for pooling export proceeds. Our commitment under it is open to more than one interpretation, and the State Department stand ready to discussthe matter with us. But I regard it as essential that we should not appearto be trying to evade our obligation, though we should argue for a favourableinterpretation of it.B. Procurement.20. Another question related to the financial talks is that of procurement.It is important that as well as the indigenous resources of the two zones allimports should be pooled. It would further be desirable to reach an agreement which would avoid the two Governments buying against each other in the samemarket. The best way of ensuring this would be to agree that the UnitedKingdom should purchase in the Dominions and sterling area and the UnitedStates in the United States, Central and South America. In the case of wheat,we should also try and obtain United States agreement to the Anglo-canadian wheat contract being reserved for the United Kingdom and other areas of UnitedKingdom responsibility, excluding the British Zone of Germany. This would ineffect place the primary responsibility for feeding the combined zones on theUnited States. This, however, is a very delicate matter owing to Americansensitiveness on the Canadian wheat contract, and we must not allow our majorfinancial objective to founder on this point.C. Short-term Economic Policy.21. No estimate can be prepared of the financial cost of operating the combined zones, without making certain assumptions in regard to import and export policy. The two most important commodities which are involved are food and coal. As regards food, we should aim at increasing imports as soon as supplyconditions permit so as to provide the normal consumer with a diet of 2,000calories per day. This is unlikely to be possible until after the 1947 harvest. It ishoped to reduce coal exports from the British Zone in December by 350,000 tons ascompared with September. We should certainly not assume any increase in exportsabove this figure during 1947 until a substantial increase in coal production hasbeen achieved. If the Americans are prepared to agree to a greater reduction than this we should be prepared to follow, even up to a complete moratorium on exports for a period of, say, six months. We should in this case press the americans to provide extra coal to take the place of these German exports. Asregards other imports and exports we should be governed by two principles : (a) That Germany should be allowed to import commodities which are essential to the rehabilitation of her basic and principal consumerindustries.(&amp;) That we should not force her to export goods which, if temporarilyretained in Germany, could be calculated to produce larger dividendsat a later date.We should, however, closely scrutinise Germany&apos;s import and export trade as a whole, and in particular take steps to see that indigenous resources of Germancommodities in short supply, and for which a substantial demand exists(e.g., cereals) are properly collected and distributed.D. Long-Term Problems.22. If the Americans agree to accept the major share of running our two zones, they will expect to take the lead in framing long-term policy towards germany. We can influence their policy but we must be prepared to makesacrifices to their point of view. It is, therefore, important that the washington disscusions should include a review of the major issues that are likely to arise atthe meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers, with a view to reaching generalagreement on the basic principles.
The chief matters are the following :-,(a) Economic Unity.23. In order to comply with the Potsdam principle in regard to economic unity, we have the right to demand of Russia :  (i) that there shall be equitable distribution of indigenous resourcesthroughout the zones and a common ration standard;(ii) that a common import/export programme shall be established for germany  IS  1 whole;1     (iii) that there shall be no reparation deliveries from current production solong as there is an accumulated deficit in the balance of paymentsaccount of any one zone.In order to preserve a basis of equality between Russia and the western powers, two further points follow from these principles, namely: (iv) that Russia should make a payment towards the accumulated deficits ofthe British and American Zones of an amount to be determinedrepresenting the value of continuing reparation deliveries taken by russia to date;(v) that the four  Occupying Powers should share in the deficit fromfinancing Germany in agreed proportions.  .24. The Russians will never accept (iv), are very unlikely to accept (v) and,judging from conversations with them in Berlin, will probably not accept (iii).If a compromise with Russia to obtain economic unity can therefore be achievedonly on the basis of (i) and (ii) and some limitation of (iii), the financial cost tothe United States and United Kingdom will inevitably be higher than it wouldbe if their liability was confined to the British and American Zones only. If thereis complete freedom of movement of goods within Germany, and Russia takescontinuing reparation deliveries from her own Zone, goods imported into andproduced in Western Germany will inevitably flow eastwards to fill the vacuum.25. On the other hand, if we do not make these concessions, we shall be forced to keep the British and American Zones separate from the rest of Germany,and it is doubtful whether this area can be turned into a going concern withoutthe establishment of central political as well as economic administrations and perhaps without the establishment of a separate currency. This would be tantamount to splitting Germany into two.26. It must, however, be recognised that the political and economic methods which the Russians are adopting in their own Zone (e.g., building up the SocialistUnity Party; the steady integration of German industry with that of the soviet union) are leading to the virtual establishment of a separate State in eastern germany. All the evidence suggests that even if Russia agreed, on terms, to continue unity she would not act in accordance with the spirit of the agreement.We should have little opportunity of checking what she did in her own Zone andenforcing her co-operation. Furthermore, economic unity would enable Russia tohave free access to Western Germany, which, so long as its present economic difficulties and political disunity prevail, would be highly vulnerable toCommunist infiltration.27. Nevertheless, the Russians are anxious to achieve unity, but on theirown terms. These are the domination of a Central German Government, and through it, the control, or at least an equal voice in, the administration of the ruhr. Moreover, the Russians are over-driving the industries of their own zoneto such an extent that, unless they are able to draw on the resources of western germany, it will become, even with its relatively prosperous agriculture, a serious financial and political liability to them. If, therefore, we and the Americansstood fast on the non-acceptance of unity except on our own conditions, it is atleast possible that the Russians might change their tune and make a considerable advance towards us. Even if this . was not sufficient, and the separation of western Germany resulted, the Russians would almost certainly choose to regard this as only a temporary measure, and would wish to retainvthe machinery of theControl Commission in Berlin. We should, of course, accept this, even&quot; thoughthe powers of the Control Council would, in fact, be very small.28. The disadvantages of the present situation are therefore such, and arelikely to remain such, that we should be unwise to press.for unity unless theRussians are prepared to accept all the conditions set out in paragraph 22 above,
with the possible exception of (iv). We should certainly start by maintaining a claim to all five. If this should lead to a split between Eastern and western germany, this need not necessarily be permanent. If would however provide anexceedingly valuable opportunity to rebuild the economy of the British and american Zones. This would improve our bargaining position against theRussians by making them more ready to accept our conditions for unity in returnfor the economic benefits which unity would bring them.29. In the course of the Washington discussions we should try and persuade the Americans to pursue a similar policy. If, however, they are so set on unitynow as to be ready to make concessions, we should attempt to reach agreementwith them on their extent and nature and to induce them to accept the additionalfinancial burden that such concessions would involve.(b) Level of Industry.30. It is generally accepted that the Level of Industry Plan agreed in Berlinlast March is too severe, particularly in regard to German steel capacity, whichshould, in my view, be raised from the present figure of 7\ million to 11 million tons. The Americans and the Russians agree in principle that the level shouldbe raised, but we do not know to what extent. The French are anxious to see aGermany which is industrially weak and would probably like to see the Plancarried out in full. The British Element of the Control Commission have recommended that, rather than try to re-assess the capacity needed to ensure for germany a reasonable standard of living, we should apply a rough and readymethod of modifying the Plan by reducing by, say, 50 per cent, the restrictionson production recommended in it. They also suggest the reconsideration ofcertain of the total prohibitions on industrial production with a view to allowingsome limited output in certain fields.31. I agree in principle with this proposal but have asked for it to be examined by the Departments concerned, particularly as regards the securityaspect, and will submit detailed proposals as soon as their report is available.In the meantime, I would ask my colleagues to agree that we should seek Americanapproval to sufficient modifications in the present Plan to ensure that Germanyshall eventually be assured of a large enough favourable trade balance to enable her to repay the liabilities that have been and will be incurred by the occupying powers.(c) Reparations.32. So far only a very few plants which are surplus to German require-ments on the basis of the Level of Industry Plan have been declared available as reparations and allocated to the claimant Powers. The Americans have refusedto proceed further with the allocation and dismantling of reparation plants until a decision has been reached on the economic unity of Germany. I propose thatthis should be discussed with them in November, since I do not think any useful purpose would be served by raising it earlier. The reparation claimant powers are getting extremely restive about the slowness of reparations deliveries and decisions on our future reparations policy should be agreed with the Americansas soon as possible. Meanwhile, I am prepared for individual items of capital equipment which are urgently needed in the United Kingdom and by the I.A.R.A.Powers to be removed from the British Zone.33. As regards the line we should take with the Americans on reparationsgenerally, my views are as follows. If we achieve economic unity we shouldcontinue to deliver to the Russians the 25 per cent, to which they are entitled under Potsdam. With the proposed adjustment of the Level of Industry plan the amount available to them will, of course, be reduced. If, however, we fail to achieve economic unity, we must face the fact that in respect of reparations a breach of the Potsdam Agreement has occurred. We should therefore reserve allplant delivered as reparations from the combined Anglo-United States Zones forthe I.A.R.A. Powers, except for the 15 per cent, which under Potsdam isdeliverable to the Russians in return for supplies of an equivalent value.34. As regards reparation deliveries from current production in the western zones, there can be no question of these until Germany has repaid the advancesshe has received from the Occupying Powers including external occupation costs.If, by the time these have been repaid, Germany has a substantial favourabletrade balance, we should consider taking current deliveries from the Western[32554] c
Zones for a limited period, but these should be exclusively for the I.A.R.A.Powers. The Potsdam Agreement limits Russia&apos;s claims on the Western Zonesto capital equipment, and her current deliveries must be obtained exclusivelyfrom her own Zone. These should not, however, under Potsdam, be taken so longas there is a deficit in the balance of payments of any one Zone. This is an indispensable condition to the treatment of Germany as an economic whole (thispoint is discussed in greater detail in paragraphs 23-29 abqve).(d) Control of Industry.35. The proposed modification of the Level of Industry Plan will bring to the fore the question of Allied control over German industry. The americans are believed to favour a plan for the control of industry as a whole. This canbe worked in with our plans to set up a special control for the Ruhr, on which Ishall be circulating a separate paper.(e) Socialisation.36. The S.P.D. party in the British Zone produced, on the 25th September,a manifesto which included the socialisation of Germany&apos;s basic industries. they further stated that the introduction by us of measures to give effect to theirpolicy would be regarded as the price of their collaboration. We cannot acceptdictation from any German political party, but it is clear that a large measureof socialisation in Germany is inevitable, and the Germans of all parties in ourZone (apart from the Right-wing of the C.D.U.) would accept any lead whichwe gave them in this direction. Socialisation is, in fact, the only course to follow in our Zone as regards the major heavy industries. The Americans in theirZone are more inclined to support the C.D.U. Party, which in that Zone haspronounced Right-wing tendencies. I have no confidence in the CD XL provingin the long run an effective barrier against the revival of German nationalism,and feel convinced that this can only be achieved by building up the S.P.D. Thisis an additional reason for encouraging a programme of socialisation. I do not anticipate any strong objection from the Americans, provided our public utterances are tactfully phrased and as far as possible allow the initiative tocome from the Germans.Section V.Political Questions.37. Apart from the two questions relating to the British Zone, upon whichI am asking for immediate decisions in paragraphs 44-48 of this memorandum,the broad future political structure of Germany requires consideration and discussion with the Americans. I have received from the Commander-in-Chief,in answer to the Directive of the 9th September (circulated to the Cabinet asCP. (46) 340) a number of fairly detailed proposals, which appear generally satisfactory. These will require careful study as we go along. At the moment,however, I do not ask for any decision by my colleagues upon them, but merely for authority to discuss, first with the Americans in Washington, and later atthe Council of Foreign Ministers, a scheme on the lines set out below.38. The long term policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government with regard toGermany is to establish political conditions which will secure the world against any German reversion to dictatorship and any revival of German aggressivepolicy. Constitutional machinery to ensure these ends must be established whichwill be acceptable to ttfie German people and have a good chance of beingpermanent. In order- to achieve this, the occupation of Germany as a whole must continue for a number of years, so that habits of orderly self-government maygrow up amongst the Germans and the ideals of freedom and democracv becomefirmly established.39. The constitutional objective to which His Majesty&apos;s Government are working in Germany is the establishment of a fully decentralised system consist-ing of regional units (Lander) with the widest possible powers, and of a centralelected Government with exclusive or over-riding powers on such matters as arereserved to it. We wish to steer a middle course between a loose confederation ofmore or less autonomous States on the one hand and a unitary centralised State,controlled in all essential matters from the centre, on the other. The thoroughlydecentralised system which we favour is one in which sufficient powers areretained at the centre for the economic planning and co-ordination which are
essential in a modern State, the residual powers being left to the exclusive com-competence of tlhe constituent Lander. Encouragement would be given in this way for differences in tradition, religion and economic circumstances which exist invarious parts of Germany. There might be an intermediate category of administrative powers in which the Lander would carry out certain fundamental principles issued by the central authorities, using for this purpose their ownCivil Service and administrative machinery. The precise definition of the powersto be reserved to the centre, and of the residual powers to be exercised by theLander (and of any intermediate powers) will require further careful study.40. The advantages of some such scheme is that considerable progress can bemade towards it (and has already been made) while the present Zonal boundariesstill remain.  It is in general accord with American thinking.41. As regards the establishment of a Central German Government, it isclear that certain necessary pre-conditions must exist before such a government can be set up.  These are :-. (a) To allow free movement for Allied personnel, as well as Germans, with-out regard to Zonal boundaries;(b) To treat all members of the Central Government and its administrationas under the joint control of all the Occupying Powers, and not to arrest them or charge them with offences against those Powers except by quadripartite agreement;(c) That Germany must be treated as a genuine economic whole.(d) That conditions must exist throughout Germany as a whole wherebythere can be free elections, and a reasonable prospect of the GermanCentral Governments authority running effectively throughoutGermany. 1   -   .42. As to structure, we tentatively contemplate a Two-Chamber legislature,consisting of a Lower House, elected by the whole of the German people, and anUpper House, consisting of representatives of the Lander. The powers of theUpper House would be restricted to those necessary for maintaining the positionof the Lander in the Constitution. There might also be a Supreme Court, onthe lines of the United States Supreme Court, with jurisdiction to give rulingson the vires of all central and provincial legislation.43. On two matters, however, in connexion with the political situation of the British Zone, I require the approval of my colleagues so.that immediate action can be taken.  These are:  .(a) The number and boundaries of further Lander with nominated and ultimately elected Governments in that part of the British Zone which lies outside the new Land North Rhine-Westphalia.(b) The devolution of governmental powers and responsibilities to thenominated Governments of the new Lander, the determination of thepowers of the two Governments in relation, on the one hand, to military Government authorities (distinction between reserved andunreserved powers) and, on the other hand, to the newly constitutedInter-Zonal German Agencies.44. As to (a) the Commander-in-Chief recommends that, in addition to LandNorth Rhine-Westphalia, two other Lander should be formed, namely thefollowing : Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen) comprising Hanover, Brunswick, Olden-burg and Schaumburg-Lippe.Schleswig-Holstein.In addition the Hanseatic towns of Hamburg and Bremen should for thetime being each be given independent status until their final place in the Germanorganisation is later agreed by German opinion. The boundaries would remainin principle as at present.45.   I recommend acceptance of these proposals.   They are the proposalswhich obtained the largest measure of approval of our German Advisers.   Theyare reasonable and fit in with parallel arrangements in the American Zone.   The[32554] d
risk that the new Lander will be outweighed by the powerful North Rhine-Westphalia Land can be discounted, since it is intended that the latter will besubject to International Control.46. As to (b) the Commander-in-Chief reports that a nominated repre-sentative council is being set up in the Land North Rhine-Westphalia. It willbe possible to hand over immediately to the Government of the Land all powers which it is not intended to reserve for a future German central government. Itshould be possible to set up Governments in the remaining Lander in our Zonewithin two months of their boundaries having been settled, and these Govern-ments should be exercising full powers by the end of the year. Each LandGovernment will be asked to propose its own constitution which will then besubmitted to the Land Parliament, after this has been elected, and passed subjectto the. approval of the Regional Commissioner. Provided certain principles areobserved the constitutions of the various Lander need not be identical. Withinthe Lander there will be decentralisation to local authorities and the administra-tive structure must not be too expensive. As soon as the newly formed land governments have acquired legislative powers they will pass legislation subjectto the approval of the Military Governor acting in each case through the regional commissioner. Arrangements will be made to ensure that the powers exercised by the Land Governments will not conflict with the powers at present exercised by the Central Bipartite Board which deals with certain functions arising fromthe fusion of the British and United States Zones.47. I recommend that these proposals be adopted. They meet with theapproval of the Germans in our Zone and are reasonable.Ruhr Coal : Steps Taken to Give Effect to Recommendations of Experts,E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,&quot;17th October, 1946.ANNEX ARecommendations.(1) Recruitment of moreworkers.WTe are still continuing with our drive toobtain more labour. There is, however, nomeans, short of force, to ensure that directedworkers arrive and remain at the pits. to attract labour every effort is being made toimprove the status of miners, e.g., increasing-wages, improving housing, increasing sup-plies of consumer goods. If these measuresdo not achieve results, we may have to intro-duce some form of compulsory service, evenalthough this is unpopular with the minersthemselves.Action Taken.(2) Improved incentives to pro-duction.This point is partially dealt with under(1) above. In addition, steps are beingtaken to link the increases in wages and the improved supplies of consumer goods withincreases in output.(3) Improvement   in   technicalcontrol and discipline.This question is closely bound up withthe question of denazification. &apos; A Germanpanel of trades unionists and mine managersunder an independent chairman has beenestablished. It has worked well and fast and.should complete its task in a matter of weeks.Trades unions and works councils are closely associated with the running of the mines andthe measures necessary to improve attendance at work. The question of giving attendancebonuses is under examination and will, ifconsidered necessary, be introduced when the wage increase comes into effect (see para-graph (10) below).
Recommendations.(4) Increased propaganda.(5) Increased production of mining supplies.(6) Reduction in colliery con-sumption.(7) Plans  should be  preparedfor future coal production.(8) More food should be givento the miners, includingminers&apos; families.(9) Improvement    in    housing conditions.Action taken:Steps are being taken, to insert advertise-ments in all papers in the Zone emphasising the importance of coal production. Theinformation services of the British element of the Control Commission are in close touchwith the North German Coal Control and are working out with them measures for intensi-fying propaganda.Thirty per cent, of steel production in theBritish Zone goes into mining supplies.Together with transport, food and B.A.O.R.requirements, mining supplies receive toppriority. We cannot give them a higher priority than this without affecting in-dustries on which a continuation of thepresent rate of coal supplies depends, e.g.,sufficient steel must be allocated to transport to ensure that the coal can be moved, and to agriculture and food-processing industries toensure that the population is fed.Colliery consumption is almost identicalin the Ruhr and in the Saar. Both we andthe French are trying to reduce this consump-tion, which is abnormally high, owing toinefficient plant and to the disproportion-ately low output of the mines.This has always been done in the british zone, production targets being establised for each group of collieries.Rations for miners have been graduallyincreased since last July, and from the14th October next miners will receive 4,000calories per day, plus an additional 200calories for those living in urban areas. Atthe same time, the rations of miners&apos; familieswill be raised to 1,550 calories per day, witha similar 200 calories bonus for urbandwellers. We are not prepared to increasethe rations of miners&apos; families above those inforce for families of other categories ofworkers.. Unlike the Saar, the Ruhr minesare part of a much larger industrial con-centration, and the increase in the rations of miners&apos; families would lead to demands for similar increases in other classes of depen-dants, which would be difficult, if not impossible, to resist.For the fourth quarter of this yearallocations of building materials have been greatly increased and now amount to all that can be handled by the available building labour force.&apos; Nissen huts have been erected,and more are being sought. It must, however,be emphasised that temporary housingabsorbs considerable quantities of building materials for foundations, services.which could otherwise be used for repairpurposes. There is therefore a limit on theamount of prefabricated houses that canadvantageously be imported.
Recommendations.Action taken.(10) Increased wages for miners.(11) There are too many surface workers at the mines.This question has already been partiallydealt with in paragraph (1) above. Agree-ment has now been reached between repre-sentatives of all Four Powers on a 20 percent, increase in wages. It has been left to each zonal authority to decide how the detailsshall be worked out. In our Zone we intend to leave it for negotiation between themanagement and the trade unions. TheFrench policy, however, is to decide thedetails of the increase themselves.We agree, but those working on the surface are medically unfit for undergroundwork. Medical standards, which have been checked and considered reasonable by medicalexperts from the British mines, are beingtightened up, and any fit men found aboveground are being sent below ground. Wehave agreed to employ women on surfacework. These, however, are not needed atpresent, and will only be needed when the underground labour force has been sub-stantially increased.We have already carried out this policywhenever it has seemed desirable to do so.Concentration implies a greater mobility oflabour than exists under the present economicconditions of the Ruhr. Moreover, if thispolicy is carried too far, it leads to deterioration-tion in the working conditions of the unusedpits, which in turn means a lowering of our production targets.The above catalogue of Recommendations made and Action taken represents,with one exception, all of the major findings of the Committee of Experts. Theone exception where we and the Americans are in disagreement with the Frenchis the question of management. The French wish to substitute for the control which we at present exercise over the mines the direct management of production by non-German technicians. We cannot accept this suggestion. Experience hasshown that the assumption of direct management responsibility by foreigners will lead to passive resistance on the part of the workers, who will plead as an excuse for their own shortcomings that they were acting under instructions of the Allies.Moreover, the principle of foreign management is completely inconsistent withour objective of socialising this industry, a policy which has the general supportof the vast majority of the German people.(12) Work should be concentratedboth at efficient pits andunderground.
