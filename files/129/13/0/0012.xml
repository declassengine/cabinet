(46) 362.27z?A September, 1946.CABINET.THE FIFTH SESSION OF THE U.N.R.R.A.  COUNCIL.Memorandum by the Minister of State.THE Debates of the Fifth Session of the U.N.R.R.A. Council were, of course,dominated by the fact that the Governments of the contributing nations had made it plain that they considered the post-war emergency period to be over, and thatthey could make no further percentage contributions to the U.N.R.R.A. funds.2. This decision was naturally unwelcome to the Governments of the receiving nations, whose delegates were acutely conscious of the fact that theagricultural and industrial rehabilitation of their countries is far from complete and that the standard of living of their peoples is still extremely low.3. It seemed likely at the beginning of the session that this might lead toa sharp conflict about &quot; the continuance of U.N.R.R.A.,&apos;: in which the greatachievements of this first organ of the United Nations might have been obscured.There was also a danger that Mayor La Guardia might fan the flames, and might say and do things during the Council which would have seriously underminedthe credit of the Administration.4. Happily these dangers were averted. As the result of a thorough andsearching discussion, broad agreement was reached on the following points : (i) U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s work should be regarded as the first stage in the policy set forth in the Atlantic Charter, namely, that the United nations would strive by international economic co-operation to free &quot; all menin all lands &quot; from want,(ii) In this first stage, free relief was needed for nations who had sufferedso much in the war in the common cause that they were unable to.reconstruct their national life by their own efforts, or to pay for theimports they required.(iii) U.N.R.R.A. had administered this reiief with very notable success andhad thereby averted grave disasters starvation, epidemics, perhapscivil wars which would have affected most adversely not only the receiving nations, but the world at large.(iv) As a result, a large measure of rehabilitation had been achieved in allreceiving countries. While some of them might require imports during the present crop-year (1946-47) for which they had not atpresent the visible resources to pay, broadly the period of relief was over, and their needs now represented primarily a balance of payments problem.(v) It was too soon to determine in August 1946 what, if any, the uncovereddeficit in their balance of payments accounts would be. This was truefor two reasons.(vi) First, the full results of the harvests were still unknown. It was alreadycertain, however, that in most cases these results would be much morefavourable than had been expected when the claimant countries had prepared their written statements asking for U.N.R.R.A. help. Thedeficits they had shown would, therefore, in most, if not in all, cases,be correspondingly reduced.13589   [32454] b
(vii) Second, it was not possible to know in August 1946 what amounts offoreign exchange the claimant countries would be able to obtain duringthe crop-year 1946-47. The United States Government might placefurther resources at the disposal of the Import-Export Bank, but hadnot yet made a definite decision; the International Bank of Recon-struction might be brought into action, and might grant them loans,sooner than could then be foreseen; the exports of these claimantcountries might expand more rapidly than they had allowed in theestimates they had made.&apos; (viii) In the light of these considerations, the U.N.R.R.A. Council agreedunanimously on a resolution (Appendix A) which invited theAssembly of the United Nations to &quot;establish or designate suchagency or agencies &quot; as might be appropriate to review the importneeds of the receiving countries in 1947, and to make &quot; recommenda-tions as to the financial assistance that might be required to meetsuch needs as are found to exist as a result of foreign exchange difficulties which cannot be dealt with by existing agencies.&quot;5.   This sensible compromise had the following advantages : &apos;(i) It recognised that, while there may still be a need for some direct relief,the nature of the problem has been changed by the success of u.N.R.R.A.&apos;s work. Broadly, the remaining task is that of long-termreconstruction, which should be carried out through the permanentinstitutions of the United Nations.(ii) The forthcoming Assembly can deal with the matter in the early future,and the &apos;&apos; agency or agencies&apos;&apos; to which it entrusts the work will beable to report in good time for the necessary action, if any, to be taken.(iii) The provision of relief, if it be needed, will remain the internationalresponsibility of all the more fortunate Members of the united nations, and will not be left simply to the United States and theUnited Kingdom.(iv) Needs and resources will be screened and examined in a more compre-hensive and expert manner than ever before,(v) All other means of finding the necessary foreign exchange will be explored before the provision of direct relief is agreed to (e.g.. Inter-national Bank of Reconstruction and other loans; the organisationof the purchase of exports from the claimant countries; the bookingof remittances, &amp;o).The adoption of this Resolution was, therefore, a considerable achievement.Incidentally, the Resolution, and the discussions from which it emerged, havebeen of service to the Devasted Areas Sub-Committee of the Economic and social council which is now at work.6. That the Council passed a unanimous resolution, which was unquestionable-ably the best action it could take, should not, however, disguise the fact that notonly the U.N.R.R.A. recipients but also a number of the &quot; middle Powers,&quot; suchas Canada, New Zealand and Norway, believe that more help is needed and shouldbe given by U.N.R.R.A. or a successor organisation of similar character. the uncertainty about the date on which the International Bank may begin operations,and the present likelihood that it will only give loans to good risk countries andso not help those in greatest need, add weight to this belief. If the climate fora degree of economic collaboration between East and West in Europe whichU.N.R.R.A. has created is to be maintained, much remains to be done, on bothsides, and the time is not long. The discussions in the Economic and social council and in the Assembly on these matters will have an importance beyond that of relief and reconstruction, important as that is.Displaced Persons.7. Similarly, the Council&apos;s debates on Displaced Persons were more frank,friendly and constructive than ever before The Administration by a resolution(see Appendix B) for which the United Kingdom and the United States Delega-tions were jointly responsible, and which was eventually adopted unanimouslywith only certain limited reservations by the Soviet Union. Byelorussia and theUkraine, were authorised : (i) to intensify their efforts to encourage repatriation by all legitimatemeans;
(ii) if necessary, to continue their Displaced Persons work until the30th June, 1947;(iii) to set aside funds for this purpose to make the continuance of this workon the present scale of expenditure possible up till that date;(iv) to apply the general principles embodied in the Draft Constitution ofthe International Refugee Organisation;(v) to extend their work to any of the categories of refugees included inthe definition in the Draft Constitution, thus greatly widening andsimplifying its mandate.    (This is important to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment);(vi) to make agreements with Governments, Voluntary organisations or such bodies as the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees with a viewto helping in the re-settlement of &quot; non-repatriables &quot;;(vii) to hand over responsibility to any Refugee Authority which the united nations may designate, together with the funds mentioned above, andto arrange for the transfer of its personnel to any such authorityat any time.Thus the period in which U.N.R.R.A. was confined to the emergency main-tenance or repatriation of Displaced Persons is at an end. It is now helping toprepare for the long-term solution of the Refugee problem by the United NationsHealth.8. The Director-General was empowered to hand over to the Interim Corn-mission of the World Health Organisation any of the more important U.N.R.R.A.health functions which the Commission were willing to undertake, together withthe duties and functions entrusted to the Administration under certain Inter-national Sanitary Conventions (see Appendix C).Social Welfare.9. The Director-General was similarly authorised to hand over to the SocialCommission of the Economic and Social Council any parts of U.N.R.R.A.&apos;sSocial Welfare which it may be deemed useful to carry on for some further time(see Appendix D). A further Welfare resolution (see Appendix E) on the subjectof the rehabilitation of children and adolescents was subsequently adopted, onthe proposal of the Polish Delegation. This called attention to the continuedneeds of children and adolescents in all countries which had been victims of aggression, and resolved that any U.N.R.R.A. financial resources outstanding onthe completion of the Administration^ work should be utilised for the benefitof children and adolescents. It recommended the setting up of our InternationalChildren&apos;s Fund to which it was hoped that Governments, voluntary agencies and individuals would also contribute gifts. The Council set up a Standing Com-mittee to prepare recommendations in agreement with the Economic and social council.Surplus Stores and Medical Supplies.10. A resolution requested the Director-General to invite Governments and private organisations to make any surpluses of medical stores and equipmentavailable to U.N.R.RA. to assist in the completion of its work.Outstanding Contributions.11. The Director-General reported the remarkable fact that something like95 per cent, of the 2 per cent, of national income promised by the Members of u.N.R.R.A. i.e., of a total of nearly $3,700 million had actually been madeavailable to the Administration by the Governments The Council authorised the diplomatic Division to make a special effort to collect the remaining 5 per cent.,and to obtain gifts from other Governments which may be able to give them.Norway and Denmark, although not &quot; contributing States,&quot; because they were all themselves invaded, have made considerable gifts, and Italy, Czechoslovakia,Poland and Yugoslavia have also given indigenous supplies to U.N.R.R.A.Norway&apos;s amounts to about ^ per cent, of the national income.Completion of Shipments.12.   On the 30th June, 1946, U.N.R.R.A. had shipped 59 per cent, of thesupplies it has programmed, for the receiving countries and 41 per cent, remained to be shipped.    In view of this, the Council passed a further resolution[32454] b 2
authorising the continuing procurement and shipment of supplies until eachprogramme was fulfilled, without time limit, but subject to the earliest practicablecompletion. It is probable, therefore, that U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s pipelines to some countries will not be empty, or the need for its services of supply and supervisionended, until April 1947 in Europe, and until June or even September 1947 inthe Far East. A further session of the Council will, therefore, no doubt berequired.Conclusion.13. The above account of the Fifth Council Session is not intended tocreate the impression that there was complete concord among the delegationson all points. On the contrary, conflicting views were held with conviction andit may well be that in the Assembly debates keen divergences may emerge. Butthe Fifth Session has already laid down by general agreement the lines on which its Administration will be wound up and its great work merged in the continuingsocial and economic co-operation of the United Nations. If this programme iscarried out, I believe that the people of the United Kingdom will receive a lastingbenefit from the generous contributions which they have made to U.N.R.R.A.&apos;sfunds.P. J. N.

41Resolution No. 100.A Resolution relating to Future Relief Needs.Whereas 1. By their agreement to the terms of the Atlantic Charter the united nations have accepted the establishment of general economic well-being as one ofthe objectives of their association;2. In pursuance of that objective the United Nations Relief and rehabilitation-tion Administration was established in order to meet the needs of the liberatedpeoples in the emergency period following their liberation;3. UNRRA&apos;s resources, supplementing the efforts of the liberated peoplesto help themselves to the greatest possible extent, have permitted the liberated countries to make marked progress upon the road to economic recovery;4. UNRRA&apos;s funds will soon have been fully utilised toward meeting theneeds for which it was designed, and it was made clear that no further contribu-tions in addition to those contemplated under Resolution 80 would be madeavailable to UNRRA;5. Since the foundation of UNRRA, there have been established or arebeing established permanent agencies of the United Nations, including theEconomic and Social Council of the United Nations, the Food and AgricultureOrganization, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development andthe International Monetary Fund, in order to promote economic well-beingamongst the nations;6. Difficulties, including lack of adequate foreign exchange, may never-theless be experienced in 1947 by liberated countries in different degrees in ensuring that the basic essentials of life, particularly food and supplies foragricultural production, may be provided to the peoples while still maintaining that progress toward economic recovery which is a prerequisite to the successof the United Nations&apos; co-operation;7. Such difficulties may result in hardship and suffering in some countriesunless prompt international action is taken by the General Assembly of theUnited Nations;8. No organization now exists or has been designated which, after thetermination of UNRRA, can advise the United Nations of the means to provide further financial assistance, if and when required; it is therefore  resolved A. That the Council recommends-1. That the General Assembly of the United Nations, after considerationof the relief and rehabilitation problems to be dealt with in 1947, forthwithestablish or designate such agency or agencies as it may deem appropriate, whosefunctions shall include :(a) a review of the needs in 1947 for financing urgent imports of the basicessentials of life, particularly food and supplies for agricultural production, after the termination of UNRRA programs to theextent that they cannot otherwise be met; and(b) the making of recommendations as to the financial assistance that mightbe required to meet such needs as are found to exist as a result offoreign exchange difficulties which cannot be dealt with by existingagencies.2. That the Council delegates immediately consult with their respective governments with a view to the issuance of instructions by the member govern-ments to their representatives in the General Assembly to secure the adoptionand implementation of the foregoing recommendation.B. That the Council requests the Director-General to transmit thisrecommendation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for consideration at the next meeting of the General Assembly, and, in agreement with the central committee, to consult with and assist such agency or agencies as may beestablished or designated by the United Nations in order to facilitate its work.[32454]APPENDIX A.
APPENDIX B.Resolution No. 99.A Resolution relating to Displaced Persons Operations.Whereas 1. It is necessary under the provisions of Resolution 92 that the authorityof the Administration with respect to displaced persons under Resolutions 71and 92 be reviewed by the Council at this Session;2. As a result of the negotiations and discussions which followed theResolution adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the12th February, 1946, it has been proposed that a new International RefugeeOrganization should be created in accordance with the principles of that resolution, and a draft Constitution for that body was adopted by the Economicand Social Council on the 21st June, 1946, for submission to the member govern-ments of the United Nations;3. It is not known at what date the International Refugee Organizationcan begin operations concerning displaced persons;4. It is desirable that the work of UNRRA in regard to displaced persons should not cease until the time when the Internationa] Refugee Organization,or some appropriate interim organization, is able to take over this work;5. It is desirable, particularly in view of the objectives set forth in para-graph 7 of Resolution 92, that the work of UNRRA in regard to displaced persons should be carried out in such a manner as to bring it into harmony withthe eventual work of the International Refugee Organization;6. The Inter-Governmental Committee on Refugees is already undertakingpart of the work which will eventually be carried out by the International RefugeeOrganization;7. It is possible that the General Assembly of the United Nations, at its next session, may make provision, by means of an interim commission or other-wise, for carrying out a part or all of the work of the International RefugeeOrganization in anticipation of the creation of that body, or that some other international body or commission may be created to carry on this work untilthe International Refugee Organization begins operations;8. It is the policy of the Administration, as it is that proposed for theInternational Refugee Organization under its draft Constitution, to encourageand assist in every way possible the early return of displaced persons to theirrespective countries of origin, subject to the conditions laid down in the Reso-lution adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the12th February, 1946, and in the draft Constitution of the International RefugeeOrganization;9. Since the conclusion of special agreements between the control authorities and UNRRA, agreements have also been concluded, in conformitywith the draft Constitution of the International Refugee Organization, betweenthe governments participating in the Control Authorities and the governments of countries of origin of displaced persons; it is therefore  resolved 1. That the Administration be authorized to continue its various operationswTith respect to displaced persons until such time, or times, as they are under-taken by the International Refugee Organization, or by any appropriate interim commission, or by any other appropriate body, provided that none of these operations shall be continued by the Administration after the 30th June, 1947.2. That a fund shall be set aside from the resources of the Administrationsufficient for the continuation of these operations until the 30th June, 1947,on a scale of cost not exceeding that of its present operations. It is contemplated that such a fund may be made available without interfering with the fulfilment of the Administration^ programs of operations, the financing of which pro-grams shall not be affected by this paragraph without the approval of theCentral Committee.3. That the Administration, with the approval of the Central Committee,may transfer to any of the above organizations or bodies the whole or partof this fund, or the whole or part of its records, files, equipment or other propertyrelating to its operations with respect to displaced persons, and may arrange for
the transfer of any of its personnel to any of these organizations or bodies. TheCouncil expresses the hope that such transfer or transfers may take place as soonas possible and that the International Refugee Organization will begin operations at the earliest possible elate.4. That, in order to bring its work into closer harmony with that of theInternational Refugee Organization, the Administration may,&apos; in future, inconsultation with any of the organizations or bodies referred to in paragraph 1above and within the limits of the financial resources available, notwithstandingany resolution to the contrary,(a) apply the principles embodied in the draft Constitution of the Inter-national Refugee Organization;(b) extend or adjust its work to cover any of the categories of persons defined in the draft Constitution of the International Refugee Organization;and(c) enter into agreements, or cooperate in whatever way seems most appro-priate, with governments, voluntary agencies, individuals and such bodies as the Inter-Governmental Committee on Refugees, with aview to assisting in the work of resettlement.5. That the Council recommends that the governments members of theControl Council for Germany continue to provide such basic supplies, accommo-dation, transportation and other services as may be required for displaced persons under existing or revised arrangements between them and the Administration.Further, that the Council recommends that the governments members of theAllied Commission for Austria take note of the fact that on the completionof its present supply program for Austria, the Administration will be unableto provide the basic supplies for displaced persons in that country.6. That the Council stresses the importance of repatriating and restoringto useful and productive lives in their homelands as many displaced persons aspossible, and to that end recommends that the Administration, the control authorities and the governments of the countries of origin, should cooperate in facilitating and expediting the repatriation of the greatest possible number of displaced persons in accordance with the relevant principles of UNRRA, withthe Resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the12th February, 1946, and with the draft Constitution of the InternationalRefugee Organization.7. With a view to giving effect to the foregoing, the Council in particularrecommends the following measures : (a) That the Administration in the course of the performance of its functions in respect of displaced persons should bear in mind that the maintask to be performed is to encourage and assist in every way possibletheir early return to their country of origin, having regard to theprinciples laid down in paragraph (c) (ii) of the Resolution adoptedby the General assembly of the United Nations on the 12th February,1946.(b) That the Administration should facilitate the dissemination to displaced persons of information supplied by the governments of their respective countries of origin concerning conditions in those countries and thedesirability of their return through the distribution of printed matterand other appropiate means, and the establishment so far as possible of close contact between the displaced persons and liaison officersappointed by the governments of their respective countries inaccordance with the provisions of Resolution 92, and facilitatefree and uncensored communications between displaced persons andtheir relatives and friends in their countries of origin.(c) (i) That the Administration shall remove all UNRRA personnel whodiscourage repatriation,(ii) That the Administration shall admit to displaced persons camps only such voluntary agency personnel as undertake not to discouragerepatriation and shall remove any such personnel if they are found to discourage repatriation,(iii) That the Central Committee, in order to keep itself informed of theprogress of the Administration^ displaced persons operations, mayin its discretion request the Administration to organize field trips by representatives of the governments concerned to such assembly centersas the Central Committee deems appropriate.
(d) That close cooperation and consultation should be established between thegovernments of the countries of origin and the Control authorities or the Administration and any organization or body which mayundertake any of the functions of UNRRA, with a view to furnishingan adequate number of liaison officers, appointed as contemplated inResolution 92, qualified to present the fullest information to displaced persons for the purpose of encouraging their repatriation. Thiscooperation should further aim at (i) increasing and expediting the supply of such  informationthrough other appropriate channels, including the press andthe post,(ii) facilitating free and uncensored communication between dis-placed persons and their relatives and friends and appropriateagencies in their countries of origin, and(iii) providing advice and information which may assist the Adminis-tration and the Control Authorities in segregating those whoactively, by means of propaganda or pressure, attempt toprevent the repatriation of displaced persons.(e) That the governments of the countries of origin should bear in mind the continuing necessity for making such arrangements for the reception and settlement of returning displaced persons as may expedite,encourage and further repatriation, and take such steps as may beopen to them, in consultation with the various bodies and authoritiesreferred to above, to ensure that the displaced persons concerned are adequate^ informed as to the nature of these arrangements.(/) That the Control Authorities should be requested through the govern-ments of their respective countries, to cooperate actively with theAdministration and the governments of the countries of origin so asto enable the fullest possible effect to be given to the principles andrecommendations contained in the provisions of sub-paragraphs (a),(b), (c), (d) and (e) above.(g) That the governmental and intergovernmental authorities concerned makethe best transportation arrangements possible for the movement of displaced persons to their countries of origin.8. That the Council recommends to the Administration and to the govern-ments participating in the Control Authorities that they shall continue to make every effort to ensure that no person obtains international assistance who isdisqualified from obtaining such assistance under the terms of the draft Constitu-tion of the International Refugee Organization.9. That the Council recommends to- the governments members of the control authorities and to the governments of countries of origin of displaced personsthat they should give favourable consideration to the conclusion of bi-lateralarrangements for mutual assistance in the repatriation of displaced persons,having regard to the principles laid down in paragraph (c) (ii) of the resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the 12th february,1946.10. That where this Resolution refers to &quot; the draft Constitution of theInternational Refugee Organization&quot; it shall be read as referring to the draft constitution of the International Refugee Organization as adopted by theEconomic and Social Council on the 21st June, 1946, for submission to the member governments of the United Nations, or as subsequently amended by the Economicand Social Council or by the General Assembly of the United Nations.APPENDIX C.Resolution No. 94.A Resolution Relating to the Health Activities of UNRRA.whereas the functions of UNRRA in the field of health are necessarily of a.temporary character; andWhereasThe Council has taken note of the fact that the establishment of a WorldHealth Organization is in process and that an Interim Commission thereof hasbeen established and is functioning; it is therefore

That the Director General consult with the Interim Commission of theWorld Health Organization with a view to the transfer as soon as practicable to the Commission of the duties and functions &quot;entrusted to the Administration,under Resolutions 52 and 85, by the International Sanitary Convention, 1944,modifying the International Sanitary Convention of 21 June, 1926, the protocol to Prolong the International Sanitary Convention, 1944, the Inter-national Sanitary Convention for Aerial Navigation, 1944, modifying the Inter-national Sanitary Convention for Aerial Navigation of 12 April, 1933, andthe Protocol to Prolong the International Sanitary Convention for AerialNavigation, 1944, as well as such other functions of UNRRA in the field ofhealth as the World Health Organization or its Interim Commission may be willing&apos; to undertake.2. That the Director General is authorized to take such steps as arenecessary to effect the transfer to such Organization or Commission of UNRRA&apos;s functions under such Conventions as well as any of UNRRA&apos;s other functions in the field of health which such Organization or Commission is willing toundertake.3.   That the Director General is further authorized(a) to transfer to the World Health Organization or its Interim Commission,from time to time, any available records, equipment, materials and personnel which such Commission or Organization may desire toaccept and which are relevant to its functions; and(b) subject to the approval of the Central Committee, to transfer to suchOrganization or Commission, from the available resources of unrra, such funds as may be necessary for the performance ofthe transferred functions provided that the Organization or Corn-mission has not available other resources for financing the performance of these functions.APPENDIX D.Resolution No. 95.A Resolution Relating to the Social Welfare A activities of UNRRA.WhereasUNRRA is now performing functions in the social welfare field such asthose concerned with the problems of undernourished and orphaned children,the maimed and the handicapped, the training of skilled personnel, materials and equipment for community services; andWhereasThe Council is of the view that international action in regard to certain ofthese functions will be necessary beyond the present emergency period; andWhereasThe Council has taken note of the establishment by the Economic and social council of the United Nations of a permanent Social Commission to advise theEconomic and Social Council, inter alia, of requirements in the field of social welfare and methods by which such requirements may be met; it is thereforeResolved1. That the Director General consult with the appropriate authorities ofthe United Nations with a view to considering the desirability of transferring tothe United Nations the functions being performed by UNRRA in the field of social welfare exclusive of those relating to displaced persons.2. That the Director General is authorized to transfer to the united nations such of those functions now being performed by UNRRA in the social welfare field as the United Nations desires to undertake.3.
