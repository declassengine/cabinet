141FfIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (46)   58518TH OCTOBER,   1946.CABINETGERMANYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer,&apos; I must once more put before my colleagues the bare facts of the financial burden which the British tax-payer is carry-ing on behalf of the Germans.2.      The original estimate of the net cost of the british zone in 1946/47 was  80 millions,  of which  54 millionsrepresented the excess cost  of imports over  exports.      Thiswas bad enough - it was the equivalent of 8de   in the   on theIncome Tax, or half the  total &quot;yield of the Purchase Tax,,3.      But the picture is now much worse,      I am told that a supplementary Estimate of anything between  30 millions and 40 millions will be needed before the end of  this financialyear&apos;.      Practically all this new imposition on our people isdue to a widening of the gap between German exports and imports.     The former will fall short of the estimate by atleast  10 millions  and  the latter will exceed the estimate byat least  20 millions.      This is a scandalous state of thingsand I am deeply dissatisfied,  in particular, with our failure to obtain, more timber from our Zone.      For this failure, Iam inclined to put most blame on the military.4.      These figures will not be substantially affected by thefusion of the British and American Zones, which, I under a    ud,will not take place until early in 19477&apos;,5.      The estimate for 1947/48 is, I am told, completelyunpredictable, until details of fusion have been settled withthe Americans,      But I  have no assurance, yet, of any decrease.Indeed the Foreign Secretary in his paper  (CP. (46) 383)speaks of  250 millions as likely to be needed by the british zone during the next three years alone&apos;.6.      We cannot continue to carry this mounting burden any longer.    Morally, it is wrong that the British tax-payer should pay reparations to the Germans on this appalling scale.Economically, it is wrong that our reserves of foreign exchangeshould be diverted from feeding our own people to feeding andsupplying Germans.      The dollars which, on this last estimate,I am asked to find for  the British Zone in 1946/47, amount tono less than $160 millions.      Therefore,  I have to ask theMinister of Pood to cut down his dollar expenditure and socondemn our own people to small and duller rations.COPY NO.

7,      I agree with the Foreign Secretary that the majorportion of ttre deficit on the British and American Zommust be borne by the U.S.  Government and not by us.      when-was in Washington, I discussed the cost of Germany withMr.  Snyder and Mr. Clayton,      I found them in general agree-ment with my view that we must nut an  end as soon aspossible, to  the present intolerable drain on our resources.But I warned them that there could be no question of oursplitting with the American Government,  in equal shares,the cost of the  two Zones after fusion, and  that we should expect the -Americans  to bear by far the greater part.    I suggested a ratio of four  to one.8.      My conclusion is that all possible steps must be  taken,at once, to reduce the present demands on the Britishtax-payer.      in particular(a) Subject  to the Germans being kept impotent  tomake war again,  their exports must be vigorouslystimulated.      The suggestions in the lord president&apos;s paper (C.P.(46)  384)  should be actively pursued.(b) The decision to take, by unilateral action,machinery and whatever else we urgently needout of the British Zone should be conveyed to berlin as a definite instruction, and should becarried out promptly and effectively,    It is so high time we received some reparations, insteadof paying them.(c) The greater part of the German deficit must beborne by the- Americans, and,  if they refuse to share the cost  on a basis which is acceptable to us,  there is no alternative to making- thempay in dollars for exports from the Britishto  the American Zone.      (These exports areof the order of $160 million a year).(Intld.)    H.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1;.18TH OCTOBER,   1946,
