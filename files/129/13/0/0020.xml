(U-6) 5708TH OCTOBER,  19UGCOPY NO.ABINETPROPOSED INTBR-GOVERNMENTaL SHIPPING organisation memorandum by the Minister of transport.        In my memorandum CP. (2+6) 252,  I informed my colleagues of the two Resolutions adopted by the United maritime consultative Council at Amsterdam in June.      The Council meetsagain in Washington on the truth October.      As the agreementconstituting the United Maritime Consultative192+6, the will be toCouncil ceasesmost importantdiscussto have effect on the 31st October,business at the forthcoming sessionarrangements for continued inter-governmental consultation on shipping after the termination of the United maritime consultative Council.2.        The Council will have before it the Report of theCommittee it set up to consider in detail the constitution,scope and procedures of a possible future inter-governraentalbody to deal with shipping matters.      This Committee met inLondon under the chairmanship of the Deputy Secretary of rayDepartment in July.      It included representatives of Belgium,Canada, France, Netherlands, Norway, Poland,  United Kingdomand United States.3.        The Committee prepared, a Draft Plan for an Inter-Governmental, Maritime Consultative Organisation,  a non-executive body of which the scope is described as follows in Article I of the Draft Plan:-&quot;The Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative organisation shall be established as a permanent inter-governmental agency in the shipping field:-(i)    to provide machiners^ for co-operation between governments in regard to matters in the field of Governmental regulation and technicalpractices of all kinds affecting shippingengaged in international trade,  and in matters concerning maritime safety and efficiency of navigation to encourage the general adoptionof the highest practicable standards;(ii)    to encourage the removal of all forms of discriminatory action and unnecessaryrestrictions by Governments affectingshipping engaged in international trade,and to promote the free availability ofshipping services to the commerce of theworld without discrimination in accordancewith the principles underlying the atlantic charter;

(iii)    generally to provide for the consideration &quot;by governments of any shipping problems of aninternational character involving mattersof general principle, which are unsuitable for settlement through the normal processes of international shipping business, ana to exchange information between the Governmentsrelevant to matters arising under sub-paragraphs(i),   (ii) sad (iii)  in regard to merchantshipping&quot;.h.        The Organisation would consist of(a) on Assembly representative of all participating governments;(b) a Council of 16 members of which 8 would begovernments of nations with the largestinterest in the provision of internationalshipping services,  h being governments ofother maritime nations with the largestinterest in international trade, theremaining h being elected with regard tothe desirability of adequate geographicalrepresentation on the Council;and,(c)    a Maritime Safety Committee of 12 governmentshaving an important interest in maritimesafety and owning substantial amounts ofmerchant shipping,  of which not less thannine would be the largest ship owningnations.      The Organisation would also havea Secretariat with carefully defined functions.5.        The Draft Plan provides that the Council should exercise all the powers and functions of the Organisation;it would meet as frequently as necessary.      The assembly would hold regular meetings once every two years.      Theinterests of the maritime nations would be given full weight through the Council.6.        My colleagues will -recall that,  (as reported inC.P.(h6) 230),  the Temporary Transport and CommunicationsCommission,  established by the Economic and Social Council,proposed that the United Nations should sponsor theestablishment of a world-wide inter-governmental shippingorganisation to deal with technical matters.      following the lead given by the United Kingdom, the Committee of theUnited Maritime Consultative Council approached this question on the lines that the proposed body should handle thoseshipping matters which are properly the concern of governments,and which are unsuitable for settlement through the normalprocesses of international shipping business.      If thisdefinition  of function is adopted, we&quot;should be assisted in the promotion of conditions in which our shipping canrestore and improve its position in the world carryingtrades In fair competition with other flags.      The proposedOrganisation would provide a forum at which we could discuss-2-

the policies of other governments v/hich might hoverestrictive and discriminatory results,  and attemptto reach agreement for the elimination of such practices,without running the risk that the Organisation would interfere in the normal processes of business,  on whichwe rely to hold our own in international shipping.      Inthis respect, we have hitherto been successful in guiding -the course of the discussions along the lines of theproposals v/hich I mode in ray memorandum C.P.(b,6) 230.7-      I have informed representatives of owners and of theseafaring unions in confidence of the proposals preparedby the Committee of the United Maritime consultative council.    Both sides of the industry have expressed generalagreement with the proposals and with the view that theUnited Kingdom Government should support them.8.        Subject to some minor points of difference,   theCommittee which prepared the Draft Plan were unanimous in their conclusions.      I believe that it will be generally acceptable to most,  if not all,  of the Governments on theUnited Maritime Consultative Council.9.        The proposed Organisation would be open to all nations willing to subscribe to the instrument establishingit.36     The intention is that it should become a &quot;specialised agency&apos;1 of the United Nations brought into relation to theEconomic and Social Council.        The United maritime consultative Council was invited by the Secretary Generalof the United Nations to acquaint the latter with itsviews on the need for a future inter-governmental organisation in the shipping field as proposed by the Temporary transport and Communications Commission.      The Council will no doubtreport to the Secretary General when it has reached agreement at its forthcoming session.      On the assumption that themajority,  if not all,  of the Governments on the united maritime Consultative Council will be favourably disposed towards the Draft Plan,  I propose to instruct my delegation to aim at establishing a Provisional Organisation pendingthe setting up of a permanent Organisation under the auspices of the United Nations.10,      It is important to provide for continuity in thearrangements for inter-governmental consultation on shippingafter the cessation of the United Maritime consultative council.      The maritime notions would then possess an organfor expressing their agreed views when  consulted by theTransport and Communications Commission.      I consider,  andthe Foreign Office are in  agreement with this view,  thatthere is advantage in establishing a Provisional organisation on the basis now proposed.      When the constitution of apermanent Organisation comes to be considered by the Economicand Social Council,  it will be easier to secure satisfactory arrangements if they are already in being than if they haveto be created de novo from discussion in the Economic and.Social Council.      This is important because,  whilst the35   More strictly the Organisation may be open to all members of the United Nations, and to other Statessubject to the terras of any relationship agreement which may be concluded with the United Nations.

proper weight given to &quot;the interests of meritIrae notionsis necessary for the effective working of a &quot;body dealing withShipping matters, I  am advised that this might seem to involve some departure from the normal composition of United Nations&quot;bodies.It would be useless,  and probably dangerous&apos;to our interests, to establish a body to deal with shipping in whichthe maritime powers were not effectively able to influence the discussions and decisions.    ,1 do not consider that we could safely support the establishment&apos;  of such a body.11.      I hope,  therefore,  that the United Maritime consultative council will agree on Recommendations to its constituentmember governments to the effect that they should constitute a Provisional Organisation v/hich would come into being when a sufficient number of governments had notified their acceptance of the Recommendations to the United States and united Kingdom Governments.      The Provisional organisation would deal with matters falling within the scope of theproposed permanent Organisation, and would in close contact with the Transport and Communications Commission of the UnitedNotions consider the convention which will be necessary forthe establishing of a permanent Organisation.      I also proposethat the Recommendations should include a clause to theeffect that other governments interested should be invitedto adhere to the Provisional Organisation,  and that there shouldbe certain vacancies available for such governments on itsCouncil.12.      The Soviet Government has not so far participated inthe United Maritime Consultative Council although it hasbeen given the opportunity to do so.      I should welcomeRussia&apos;s adherence to the proposed Provisional Organisation,and opportunity will be given to the Soviet Government to adhere.13&quot;      The proposals embodied in the report of the Committeev/hich has met in London under United Kingdom, chairmanshipdo not commit the United Kingdom Government.      We should not finally commit ourselves to a particular course of actionbefore we know the views of maritime governments generally.The proposals are,however,  in accordance with our shippingpolicy as previously approved, and I ask authority to makeit known at the forthcoming session in Washington that theUnited Kingdom Government would be prepared to take part insuch a Provisional Organisation if the other governments represented on the United Maritime Consultative Council,  ora sufficient number   of the important maritime governments,ore in favour of establishing it and are prepared toco-operate.A-B.Ministry of Transport.8th October,  19^6.
