Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1946.SECRET. Copy No.    3 5CP. (46) 359.-26th September, 1946.CABINET.JAPANESE MERCHANT SHIP-BUILDING.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister ofTransport.AT the request of the Overseas Reconstruction Committee, we submitted inJanuary 1946 (O.R.C. (46) 7*) a joint memorandum on the risks which would be run if various degrees of freedom were accorded to Japan to build merchant ships.2. After discussion the Overseas Reconstruction Committee referred thematter to the Cabinet, who considered it and agreed (CM. (46) 22nd Conclusions,Minute 4) &quot; that the particular question of the extent to which Japan shouldbe allowed to retain her shipbuilding industry should be left open for discussion on the Far Eastern Commission, as part of the wider problem, and that our representatives should not prejudge the discussion of this question by demandingat the outset that Japan should be prohibited from building any ocean-going vessels.&quot;3. The United States member of the Far Eastern Commission has now putforward a proposal which provides for an &quot; assured &quot; production capacity levelbelow which various elements of Japanese industry will not be reduced. TheUnited States Authorities explain that the purpose of this proposal is to offer a safe guard which will &quot; aid in the restoration of Japanese industrial initiative, the flow of capital into the selected enterprises, and the production of goods necessaryto the support of a peacetime economy on a minimum basis.&quot;4. The reparations interest in Japanese industrial capacity has alreadybeen safeguarded for the time being by the Far Eastern Commission&apos;s InterimReparations Removal Programme. This provided that all &quot; obvious excess &quot;production capacity in. the chief war industries should be made available for reparation claims, and defined the levels above which capacity was deemed forthis interim purpose to be excessive. In this way, shipbuilding capacity in excessof that required for 150,000 tons per annum of new construction and the main-tenance of a merchant fleet of 3 million tons was designated as surplus under the interim programme. The United States Authorities state that neither thisdefinition of &quot; obvious excess &quot; capacity which has already been agreed, nor their proposed definition of t: assured &quot; minimum levels are to be regarded as reflectingUnited States views concerning the level of industry to be retained in Japanunder the terms of a final programme of reparation removals.5. The assured minimum level proposed by the United States for ship-building is defined as follows : &quot; The assured production capacity level for Japan&apos;s steel shipbuilding industry should be placed at 80,000 gross tons of new construction of shipsnot exceeding 5,000 gross tons, and supporting facilities for the service and repair of a merchant fleet of 1 - 5 million gross tons.&quot;It is necessary without delay to instruct our representatives on the Far eastern commission as to their attitude towards this &quot; assured &quot; level, below which japan&apos;s shipbuilding capacity will not be reduced.[32453]* Reproduced as Appendix.this document is the property op his britannic majesty&apos;s goyernment /
6. It is unnecessary to recapitulate our arguments against permitting japan to build ocean-going ships. They are fully set out in our memorandum, and inour view they still obtain. The Governments of Australia and New Zealand,the Dominions most nearly concerned, are in accord with them.7. It will be noted that the &apos;&apos; assured &apos;&apos; limit proposed by the United states representative affects only steel ships, and that a total gross tonnage of1-5 million is visualised. This assumes a ship&apos;s life of rather less than 20 years,and a more likely total would be at least two million gross tons, plus any of herfishing and coastal tonnage which she could construct of wood.8. In 1939 her entire coastal and fishing fleet amounted to 1 - 2 million tons,her &apos;&apos; short sea&apos;&apos; tonnage to 2-7 million and her ocean-going tonnage to1 - 6 million. It follows therefore that, if we allow her two million tons excluding any wooden construction, she will be at liberty to construct a very considerablenumber of ocean-going ships, and it is probable that within measurable time weshall start to encounter the pre-war conditions in which Japanese shipping hada very damaging effect on British shipping in the Far East.9. We appreciate that Japan as an island demands a system of transportvery different from that demanded by Continental Germany. Nevertheless, wecannot refrain from drawing attention to the difference in treatment accorded to those Powers, whereby Japan is &apos;&apos; assured &apos;&apos; a gross tonnage of 2,000,000 tons,of which probably 50 per cent, is &quot; short sea &quot; and ocean-going, while Germany is permitted 175,000 gross tons, all coastal. Moreover, our plans for control overJapanese imports, unlike those of Germany, without the employment of a large and probably unwilling corps of inspectors, are largely based on the power wecan exercise at a few ports, provided that Japan does not possess ocean-goingtonnage.10. We therefore urge that our representatives on the Far Eastern Corn-mission be instructed to press for a reduction in the maximum size of shipallowed to the Japanese industry from 5,000 to 2,000 gross tons. If this is achieved we do not consider that we need object to an upper limit of 80,000 grosstons annual building capacity, even allowing for the exclusion of woodenconstruction.11. In view of the complicated nature of the American proposals we oughtperhaps to warn our representatives that care must be taken to explain any decision most clearly to the Japanese, so as to leave no room for doubt.A. V. A.A. J. B.Admiralty, S.W. 1,26th September, 1946.APPENDIX.CABINET.Overseas Reconstruction Committee.CONTROL OVER JAPANESE INDUSTRIES FOR  REASONS of security.MERCHANT SHIP-BUILDING.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister ofWar Transport.THE Overseas Reconstruction Committee (O.R.C. (46) 1st Meeting,Conclusion 2) asked for an estimate of the risks which would be run if variousdegrees of freedom to build merchant ships were accorded to Japan, it being understood that in any event all forms of warship construction will be barred.[O.R.C. (46) 7]19th January, 1946.
2.   The first point to be made is that if the building of Merchant Ships otherthan coastal craft is allowed at all, although it may be possible to bar warship.building for a time, it will not be possible to preventthe Japanese from collectingits two most important elements, skilled men and professional experience.3. A Merchant Ship-building Industry will automatically create a corps of skilled designers, draughtsmen, technicians and labour accustomed to theproblems of ship-building, most of which are common to warships and merchant ships, and it will keep alive the ship-building tradition which is half the battletowards a change-over to warship work when the time comes. It will also enableJapan to keep abreast of current ship-building developments, which is particu-larly undesirable at a time when research into hull form and propulsion is goingforward rapidly and revolutionary changes may be expected in the next fewyears.4. The Industry necessitates precisely the plant it is desired to eradicate,viz. : heavy forging plant and foundries equipped with heavy lifting gear. Solong as the Japanese are restricted to coastal craft of, say, 1,500 to 2,000 grosstons, and round about 300 feet in length, they would not require the plantrequired for warships, since a warship comparable in size, e.g., a destroyer,requires heavier forgings than such an industry could produce. But if theywere permitted to advance into the 5,000-ton field, they would necessarily acquireplant which would equip them for cruiser building.5. But even if we could keep indefinitely a constant guard Over Japanso as to prevent her building warships as such, we should not have destroyedher powers as an aggressor. For an attack on the Asiatic coast, which isgeographically her most probable objective, ships are required which can (a) carry and discharge rocket projectiles;(b) transport troops, weapons and vehicles.For these purposes a merchant ship is a warship.6. It follows that on security grounds it is necessary to limit Japan&apos;s ship-building to the construction of coastal craft if power to become an aggressoris to be denied her.        ,s.7. If it is held that Japan needs a merchant fleet to keep her economygoing and that financially it is impossible for her to exist if her trade is carried in foreign bottoms, this is no argument for permitting her to build.8. For Japan to maintain a given standard of life, without being forced into such activity in other trades, such as textiles, as will embarrass our owncommercial activities, the &quot; lift&quot; required for essential imports can presumablybe calculated^, in terms of ton/miles. It is surely not impossible for Japan toacquire this tonnage by charter or purchase instead of building it and so retaining the ship-building tradition.9. So long as she is permitted to retain only this minimum of tonnage, and solong as her imports are carefully watched, she will have no margin of tonnage for purposes of aggression and she will have had no opportunity for building-up reserves for war production. But as soon as she is allowed to purchase moreocean-going tonnage, or to build ocean-going tonnage at all, she is at once a potential aggressor, the more dangerous since in theory she would possess nonavy, and therefore give little handle for interference.10. The effect of possible Japanese competition on our own Ship-buildingIndustry is very hard to assess. Before the war, the peak output of JapaneseMerchant Ship-building was about 400,000 tons, but this was absorbed in Japan&apos;srapidly increasing commerce, and very little of it was on Foreign Account. In1937, for example, under 13,000 tons was built on Foreign Account and in 1938under 2,000. But the Ship-building Industry was also largely employed on navalbuilding and total ship-building capacity probably amounted to almost a million gross tons, and even at that the Industry had not acquired full balance, but wasrestricted by some shortages in machinery output, and possibly had outrun itsstock of some technical personnel, defects which with its present experience itcould readily put right.11. Assuming that no limitation were placed on Japanese Merchant Ship-building, her surplus output would at once come into competition largely withour own Industry, at least indirectly.   If Japan needs, as we believe has been
calculated, about 2,500,000 tons of shipping for her minimum carrying tradeexcluding coastal trade, she could presumably build up that amount in about five years and thereafter, except for say 100,000 tons replacement tonnage, hercompetitive output might be nearly a million tons a year.12. At that time our own Ship-building Industry will probably be hardput to it to find business amounting to 750,000 tons a year. An additionalcompetitor with an output of a million and almost certainly very low costs will therefore involve a risk of loss of almost all of our &quot; export &quot; market in ships.13. Once in production, it is difficult to see how the Japanese merchant ship-building Industry could be kept down to any given output. It would bepossible for some time at least to bar subsidies, but the Japanese with theirZaibatsu experience are experts at all sorts of indirect finance, and we feel the gravest doubts of the wisdom of opening the door to any such intrusion against our war potential.14. Summing up, we strongly hold that the Japanese should not be permitted to build ships larger than the coastal type because (a) we must delay as long as possible her power to change to warshipbuilding when her period of control is over;(b) an ocean-going merchant ship is to all intents a warship, for the type of aggression she is most likely to attempt;(c) any surplus tonnage over her minimum requirements would at onceimpinge on our own ship-building output, which is a vital part of our war potential, and once started the rot might be impossible to stop.A.
