At the termination of the holiday with my wife in County Cork, at thesuggestion of the Secretary of State for the Dominions and the United kingdom representative in Dublin, I called on Mr. de Valera on the 12th September atthe Ministry of External Affairs. Sir John Maffey introduced me to theTaoiseach, and Sir John, after taking tea with us, withdrew, leavingMr. de Valera and me to ourselves.Mr. de Valera.2. My interview with Mr. de Valera lasted approximately l-g hours. the subjects we discussed were varied but, for the greater part, concerned foreign,Commonwealth and Empire affairs, Ireland and partition being the last subject.3. Mr. de Valera is exceptional among Eire politicians in almost every way.It is doubtful how much Irish blood he has. He is cool and somewhat reservedthough, like most of us, liable to become worked up on the subjects which are near to his heart. He gave me an impression of considerable competence and intel-lectual ability; indeed, he could not hold the strong position he undoubtedly doesamong the people of Eire and in his own Party if he were not a man ofconsiderable strength and ability. During our interview he impressed me asrather more human than his reputation suggests, and, in facial appearance,distinctly more human than newspaper photographs lead one to think. At the informal gathering after the dinner which followed our private interview, whilstkeeping a reserve, he talked in a friendly manner to myself and the other guests,who included representatives of political parties other than his own, and seemedto me to be on good terms with all of them, although it is right to add that I gather he is on bad terms with some who were not present.Foreign A ffairs.4. At our private interview we discussed the disturbed state of the world.I gathered that he was unhappy about Soviet policy and that this would help him to be not unsympathetic with British foreign policy as a whole. I expressedmy regret that Eire&apos;s application for U.N.O. membership had not been succesful and the hope and belief that it would not be very long before Eire was in the ranks of the United Nations. He took &quot; a shrug of the shoulders &quot; attitude.He said that they had thought it right to make the application but he did notappear to be unduly disturbed at its rejection. I think his view would be thatit did not matter a great deal as far as Eire was concerned, and that it was not likely to cause him any embarrassment among his people. The only danger isthat the rejection may have offended his dignity and it may be doubted whether he will take the initiative in seeking membership again; but, on the whole, Ithink that if U.N.O. were to make it clear in some way that an application would[32535] b
be favourably received, Eire would submit herself for membership again. Ishould doubt whether the decision, coupled with the Soviet veto, will cause himto modify his Governments policy with regard to diplomatic representation from moscow.India.5. After discussing other matters (including his dislike of the trial of thewar criminals), with which I need not trouble my colleagues, we reached India,and India took the Eire Prime Minister to Ireland. He warmly praised what our Government had done with regard to India and thought it quite likely (andseemed pleased at this) that the granting of independence to India would befollowed by the new Indian Government desiring to be associated with theCommonwealth and to enter into military arrangements with us, for there wouldnot be much point in India getting her independence from the British if she thenbecame open to the risk of being dominated by some other Great Power.The Partition Issue.6. With emphasis, Mr. de Valera said that if only Mr. Lloyd George, in theIrish Treaty negotiations of 1921, had been forthcoming in concedingindependence to Ireland he, himself, would have supported, and he believed that ireland, with perhaps some argument, would have accepted, after the concession of independence, a declaration of association with or membership of the Common-wealth, and necessary arrangements for military co-operation could have beenmade. A great opportunity was lost. This brought him to partition, which hedeclared to be the outstanding issue impeding the best Anglo-Irish relations, andhe made it clear that he thought it would be a good thing if this issue could besettled.7. The Prime Minister clearly expected me to say something. I was, ofcourse, careful in response, firstly, because, as he and I clearly understood, thiswas a courtesy call and I was in no way authorised to discuss such matters onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government; and, secondly, because I could see that ourinterview might end in some heat if I did not exercise restraint. I said that I understood his views and feelings. Incidentally, I told him that I had borrowedJohn Buchan&apos;s &quot; Oliver Cromwell &quot; from our Prime Minister in the early partof the year and, after reading the chapters dealing with Ireland, I had understoodhis feeling on the subject of Oliver Cromwell with much more sympathy than i could have had I not read a life of Oliver Cromwell. This brought a laugh fromMr. de Valera, who said that I had evidently heard the story of Lloyd Georgeto the effect that he had negotiated about Ireland with Mr. de Valera for three days (or was it weeks?) and he bad not passed the period of Oliver Cromwell;this he described as an inaccurate joke and he said that, in fact, during thediscussions in Downing Street in 1921, he had only made incidental references tothe activities of Oliver Cromwell in Ireland.8. I went on to say (and he readily accepted this) that I had no authoritywhatever to say anything on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;this was buta talk between two men but that my own personal feeling was that the wisestcourse on all sides was not to hurry the partition issue. Time was a great healer,and I hoped it would be a great healer between the three parties concerned, namely,Great Britain, Eire and Northern Ireland, but if the issue were raised in anyprecipitate manner first-class trouble might ensue. From the fairly close know-ledge of Northern Ireland I had gained as Home Secretary, I was quite sure that Northern Ireland would not be a consenting party, at any rate in anything like the early future. On the contrary, they would be very actively hostile. Theyhad deep feelings about their rights and allegiances no less than Eire had abouther rights and allegiances. And, moreover, Northern Ireland had what I hadonce described in a public speech as an aggressive loyalty to the Crown and to theUnited Kingdom; therefore, to raise the matter in the early future would, i thought, cause great trouble for the three of us. Moreover, the war (and here Ihad to be very gentle) had not improved the situation. I had no wish to beprovocative or even argumentative (this he accepted with a friendly nod); I was merely approaching the matter objectively. Eire, exercising the rights sheclaimed, either according to his views about the status of Ireland or under theStatute of Westminster and Dominion status, had remained neutral in the war.As a purely practical matter, British public opinion noted that the NorthernIreland ports and airfields were of the greatest value to our war effort; and, onthe other hand, that the absence of such facilities in Eire had necessarily involved
increased Allied casualties in the Battle of the Atlantic. There was, therefore,a strong feeling that it would be dangerous to run the risk that in any futurewar the whole of Ireland might be neutral and we should be denied any military facilities in so vital an area. This was altogether apart from the great loyaltyof the British people and of Ulster to the Crown. The British Monarchy, becauseof its high standing and its strictly constitutional conduct and because of the personal popularity of The King and Queen, was held in high regard by the people jof the United Kingdom, and the tendencies away from the Crown and the 1Commonwealth in Eire during the last twenty-five years had undoubtedlystrengthened the apprehensions of the North and caused apprehension in GreatBritain. And this was to say nothing of the potential dynamite involved in the religious differences between North and South. In all the circumstances, I personally thought that from every point of view much was to be gained andnothing was to be lost by a policy of developing good co-operative relations inmatters of common concern, but not precipitating the issue of partition, which,,if raised, would lead to an explosion of no advantage to any of us. Moreover,there was plenty of trouble in the world already.9. He did not accept the view that on balance we had suffered because ofthe neutrality of Eire in the late war as compared with the official participation of Ireland in the war of 1914-18, with all the opposition and trouble which accompanied it. (He did not take this point very far because he would not wishto imply that his attitude was anything but strict neutrality in the late war.)He said he could not accept the labelling of Ireland as a Dominion because theword &quot;Dominion&quot; implied &quot;dominion over,&quot;, and, moreover, it implied TheKing&apos;s &quot;dominion over,&quot; which he and his people could not accept in view ofthe grievances that Ireland had against Kings of. England. I tried to conciliatehim by pointing out that the Dominions were, as he knew,, free and independent states within the British Commonwealth. I added that I should have thoughtthat the grievances which he&apos; held that Ireland had against us were grievancesagainst Governments rather than personal grievances against Kings. I hadlooked in at the ruins at Cashel in County Tipperary and found the burial placeof the last King of Munster, and I recalled that Ireland herself had had a goodsupply of Kings in earlier times;; my recollection of the Oliver Cromwell period was that Ireland herself was then Royalist. These representations did not affecthim; the situation was different in the Cromwell days, but in more recentyears experience had led his country into Republican paths and the word&quot; Dominion &quot; was objectionable to Irish ears; the British were too sticky aboutwords and labels. Why could not the Commonwealth, which had a considerablevariety of constituent elements, accept into membership a Republic? In the warMr. Churchill had proposed a union with the Republic of France, but surely itwas not seriously considered that the King of the United Kingdom would becomeKing of France, and if at some future date Holland or Norway or Denmarkbecame members of the Commonwealth their monarchs would have to come withthem. So why boggle at the idea of a Republic becoming a constituent part iof the Commonwealth? I reminded him that the Irish case was somewhat &apos;different in view of our near proximity and the fact of Ulster. I thought theBritish had a fairly good reputation for being adaptable about words and labels,and that some people might think the boot was on the other leg.10. Mr. de Valera held his ground and said that in his view an all-Irelandsolution was practicable. He implied.that if necessary he would be willing to concede to Ulster the powers of her existing Parliament provided there were transferred to an all-Ireland Government the powers now exercised in respect ofUlster by the United Kingdom Government. If that were conceded he appearedto be agreeable to Ireland becoming a member of the Commonwealth and makingall appropriate arrangements with regard to military co-operation. (Of course,if Eire joins U.N.O. she will undertake commitments which should producemilitary co-operation with Great Britain.)11. I thanked him very much for so freely revealing his mind to me, but said that I still felt that any&quot;attempt to rush the issue would be likely to do more harm than good. If new circumstances arose, among them a change of view onthe part of Northern Ireland (if it occurred), that would be another matter, butto expect us to coerce Ulster was expecting too much, especially in view of thetroubled world in which we all lived. He was not cross. He rather shrugged hisshoulders and indicated that in that case the difficulties in our relationships wouldhave to continue.[32535] b 2
12. It must, of course, be remembered that Mr. de Valera has been an able and lucky negotiator and fighter in Anglo-Irish relations. He has a past whichhe has already had difficulties in side-stepping in certain respects. He hasreceived much, including the Ports, without giving, and, while he manifestedmany signs of a broad and forthcoming outlook, my impression is that it isdoubtful whether he would concede anything in practice until a declaration ofall-Ireland independence had been made. Thereafter, there is a fair amount ofrisk in the light of experience (e.g., the Ports) that he might not be as forthcomingas he was in our discussion. In any future negotiations with him, it would bewell to be clear that he has to give as well as take, and that the giving cannotbe a vague anticipation of the future.Talks with other Eire Ministers.13. Our interview came to an end when we were summoned to meet theguests at the subsequent dinner which was given in my honour. Those present-included : Mr. de Valera.Mr. Sean Lemass, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry and commerce.Mr. J. McCann, Lord Mayor of Dublin.Mr. Sean MacEntee, Minister of Local Government and Public Health.Mr. Frank Aiken, Minister of Finance.Mr. Oscar Traynor, Minister of Defence.Mr. William Davin,    Members of the Dail.Mr. James Everett,    )Sir John Maffey.Mr. W. J. Dignam, High Commissioner for Australia.Mr. E. J. Garland, Acting High Commissioner for Canada.Mr. J. J. McElligott, Secretary of the Department of Finance.Mr. M. Moynihan, Secretary of Government.Mr. F. H. Boland, Secretary of the Department of External Affairs.14. The dinner and subsequent informal gathering gave an opportunityfor further conversation with the Prime Minister, his Ministerial colleagues andother guests. At these functions we all kept off high Irish politics, and myconversation with other Ministers was very largely about their departmentalbusiness. From these talks I concluded that it would be advantageous for british ministers to encourage visits from their opposite numbers in Eire or the latter&apos;principal officers and to give them such help by way of information, &amp;o, aspracticable. This should be done quietly, or suspicion might be aroused. Butit should serve to strengthen, not only good post-war relations, but a sense in eire Ministerial and official circles that they can be helped in a number of directions by friendliness and co-operation with their opposite numbers in GreatBritain.My colleagues might perhaps keep this point in mind.Visit to the President of Eire.15. On Friday the 13th September I visited the President, Mr. Sean T.0&apos;Kelly. He, also, is an old warrior of the I.R.A., but a very different type fromMr. de Valera; unlike his Prime Minister he is not an abstainer or non-smoker.He is typically Irish, hearty and full of lively good fellowship. I have no doubtthat Mr. de Valera derives some pleasure from having established the Presidentialinstitution, even though, apart from ideological considerations, it involves whatseems to me to be needless expense. I read a book called The President of ireland by the Presidents Secretary, Mr. McDunphy, on the constitutional provisionsas to the Presidency; it would appear that the Presidents powers are more limited than those of His Majesty. The diplomatic appointments are madeunder the hand of The King, countersigned by the Taoiseach. But, for therest, the constitutional functions of the President, set out in the written constitu-tion, are not materially dissimilar from those of The King, though the presidents standing is materially less and his sphere of action somewhat more limited and strictly prescribed. The President lives at the former Vice-RegalLodge in Phoenix Park.Mr. Cosgrave and Mr. Gray.16. Two other visits should be mentioned. One was to Mr. Cosgrave, theformer (Fianna Fail) Prime Minister, who was hearty and courteous but made no mention of politics; the other to the United States Minister (Mr. Gray), a goodfriend of ours and a strong opponent of Mr. de Valera&apos;s policy in relation to us.
General Observations on Eire.17.   As far as I could gather, Eire Parliamentary practice is very muchlike our own, though the Daii seems to be a quieter institution than our Houseof Commons and the Senate has more limited powers than the House of Lords;Indeed, the way in which the powers of the Senate are limited is worthy ofstudio The law is, in all essentials, British law, and I gathered that the decisionsof British Courts are accepted as decisive in some cases before the Eire Courts.I   The Local Government structure is much the same as ours, though it has beenMk thought wise in a number of cities and counties to introduce a Manager.   this somewhat limits the powers of the Councillors and would be strongly resistedif   as an undemocratic device in Great Britain.  There is a censorship on books and h   periodicals which would not be tolerated here.   Everything has been done topopularise the Irish language; it is an old language and its vocabulary is, Iif  gather, limited.  For example, there being no Irish word for &apos;&apos; telephone &apos;&apos;; theproblem is solved by knocking off the final &quot; e&quot; and printing the word in Gaeliccharacters.  Pillar boxes have been painted green, though the letters G.R., E.R.,and even V.R. survive.   Gaelic is extensively used on Irish official notepaper,H   though usually followed by the equivalent English, and the language is taughtHI   in the schools as also is English.   I did not hear Gaelic extensively spoken and,I   for all ordinary purposes, where quick understanding is necessary, for example,H   in shop windows and on the destination indicators on buses, English appearedto be universal, although in the small lettering at the bottom of the bus indicating the owner, Gaelic was resorted to.  But Gaelic did not appear to be useful whenpeople wanted to know where the bus was going.   There is no doubt, however,that despite the lack of use of the language in the ordinary way, it holds aI   strong place in the minds of a certain proportion of the Irish population.   InH   a number of ways the Irish Government have done their best to make Eire aH   foreign country, and, though success has not been by any means complete, thisH   is a fact we must face.On our holiday and otherwise my wife and I received every courtesy andI  consideration.H  Eire Labour Leaders.18. On the 13th September I had lunch with a number of leaders of theM Labour Party, who did not include Mr. Norton, the leader of the Party, as heH was in England. They were all Trade Unionists associated with the IrishK T.U.C., but not the Congress of Irish Trade Unions. They were all most friendly,i Labour politics, both in Eire and Northern Ireland, are difficult owing to the  national and religious issues.I 19.   The United Kingdom Representative (who was our host in Dublin1 and to whom I am greatly indebted for the able assistance he gave me andI&apos; all the trouble he took) was kind enough to give a cocktail party in honour ofi Mrs. Morrison and myself, where we met a large number of representative EireB  people.II. Northern Ireland.20.   On Saturday, the 14th September, we journeyed to Northern Ireland,which was very necessary if offence was not to be caused; moreover, it was aft pleasure to meet friends of my Home Office days.   We were the guests of theM Governor and! Lady Granville, who were as helpful and kind as they alwaysi&apos; are, and gave us the opportunity of meeting important people.   On Sunday, theI 15th September, I accompanied the Governor when he. took the salute at then Battle of Britain parade and Mrs. Morrison and I attended the subsequentI service at St. Anne&apos;s Cathedral, Belfast.I 21.   In the afternoon I visited the Minister of Commerce, and later the Parliamentary Secretary, when we discussed a number of economic matters ofI mutual interest.I 22.   On Monday, the 16th September,! met the Acting Lord Mayor and aI number of Belfast City Councillors at the City Hall.   The Northern ireland Government entertained me to luncheon at Stormont, the Minister of HomeH Affairs, in the absence of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance.Ip presiding.  Here I met a number of other Ministers, the Speaker of the Northerni Ireland House of Commons, and a number of Members of Parliament, including,I I think, all the Labour M.P.s, and Mr. Harry Midgley, formerly a member of
the Labour Party but now leader of the Commonwealth Party. Unhappily thePrime Minister of Northern Ireland had to be in London owing to a furtheroperation to his only surviving son, but I had the opportunity of a talk withhim in London after my return.Ulster and Partition.23. I did not tell the Northern Ireland Ministers the nature of my talk with Mr. de Valera; and they were good enough not to enquire. I thought it right, however, that I should inform Sir Basil Brooke, the Prime Minister (whom )I saw in London just after my return), of the general run of the Dublin talkon the clear understanding that it was for his personal ear only. Sir Basil is always most reasonable and co-operative. The only comment he made was thatif the issue of partition were raised there would be a storm in Ulster. If andwhen the issue is raised (and, I would here interpose, one must keep one&apos;s eye onthe point in time at which, owing to the higher birth rate, the Catholics may over-take the Protestant population) Ulster would be very insistent about two things :the entry of Eire into the Commonwealth before a United Ireland was established,together, of course, with the acceptance of the Monarchy and suitable militaryundertakings. Ulster would also raise another real but more difficult point,namety, some provision whereby the Roman Catholic priesthood would no longerimproperly intervene in State affairs, a change which would enable Ulster to tonedown its own Protestant preachers, who-&quot;the Prime Minister admits are some-times a nuisance owing to their liveliness in politics. If a United Ireland was granted independence before these things were secured, there would certainly be strong opposition from Ulster. These observations in no way minimise theopposition of Northern Ireland to discussions about partition being opened.24. These things were all put in a friendly and courteous way by the PrimeMinister of Northern Ireland. But, from my own knowledge of Northern Ireland,I should think that what he said was true of the attitude of his people, otherthan the Nationalists and the Labour Members of the Northern Irish Parliament,whose constituencies are in general in Nationalist areas, apart from that ofMr. Harry Midgley, who is a Commonwealth M.P. and who is in favour of theUnion.25. The Unionist Party in Northern Ireland is by no means wholly a conservative Party. It includes Conservatives, but a large proportion of theMembers are of a Liberal or Radical tradition; in this country some of them,such as Mr. Grant, the Minister of Labour, who is a Trade Unionist, would almost certainly belong to the Labour Party. It is the United Kingdom connection thatholds them together. This situation illustrates the difficulties of politics whennational and religious issues are to the fore and, incidentally, the special difficulties of the Labour Party in Northern Ireland, as well as in Eire.**,*&apos;* * *26. It is right for me to add that I dictated this Memorandum some days after the private interviews took place, when I was unable to take notes. i cannot, of course, be sure that my memory is wholly accurate, but I do not think have gone far wrong in the above record, which I thought would be of interestand perhaps of some use to my colleagues.27. I have shown this Memorandum in advance to the Dominions secretary and the Home Secretary, so that they could consider the question of circulatingpapers to the Cabinet on the line I took in my talk with Mr. de Valera.H. M.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,16th October, 1946.
