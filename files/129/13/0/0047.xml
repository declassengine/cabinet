THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERBMENPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (36) 397.23/&quot;^ October, 1946.CABINET.GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE UNITED NATIONS : INDIANCOMPLAINT AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.THE treatment of Indians in South Africa is an issue on which the Indians,without distinction of community, feel most strongly. Racial discrimination is naturally for them a highly emotional subject, and one to which they are boundto attach supreme importance. They are united behind the decision, firstannounced in the Indian Legislative Assembly on the 16th April last and nowwhole-heartedly supported by the Interim Government, that the matter shouldbe referred for adjudication to the United Nations, of whose good intentions asembodied in the Charter they consider this a test case.2. Our conduct in relation to this very delicate situation is, I believe, goingto be of the greatest importance in determining (a) Whether those who are now members of the Government of India canbe brought to believe that there is room for India within the BritishCommonwealth on a basis of equality and community of interests, and(b) The extent to which India will be dravyn further and further intoassociation with the U.S.S.R.3. I welcome the prevailing agreement that our representatives should notintervene in the merits of the dispute, and in this connection I would only ask that all members of the Delegation should be instructed to make their neutralityabsolute, not only at formal meetings, but also in the lobbies and in their unofficialcontacts.4. But I would also urge that our representatives should not interveneeven on the question whether the Indian complaint is admissible in view ofArticle 2 (7) of the Charter. I recognise that there are good reasons why weshould not stand aside whilst the interpretation of the Charter is being discussed.In my view, however, these are outweighed upon the present occasion by theconsideration that even this would be regarded by the Indians as direct oppositionto them, with the most serious consequences from the two points of view whichI have outlined in the second paragraph above. I therefore wish to advocatePolicy (i) in paragraph 3 of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum (CP. (46) 373).5. If, despite the foregoing considerations, the Cabinet should decide uponPolicy (ii), I would recommend that our representatives should be instructed tosay that, whilst His Majesty&apos;s Government regard the Indian claim as disqualifiedunder Article 2 (7) of the Charter, they hope that South Africa and India will find it possible again to consult on this matter between themselves as they have in the past done successfully. It would be most unfortunate if the South african government were encouraged by what happens at the U.N.O. Assembly to give theGovernment of India less consideration in these matters in future than in the past.P.-L.India Office, S.W.1,23rd October, 1946.[32589]
