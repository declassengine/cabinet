(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)I SECRET.CP.   (46)  367 COPY NO.   o^OIfVP OCTOBER 5   1946.INDIAN FOOD REQUIREMENTSMemorandum by the Mini estop of transport.      In CP.  (46) 361  the Secretory of State for India hasonce more reviewed the Indian food position in the light ofrecent developments.      Ho points out that the situation hasdisastrously deteriorated owing to the shipping strike in theUnited States and the failure of the Government of India toobtain export licences from the Argentine Government for thebalance of the maize which was purchased some time ago. .   Heurges the diversion to India of 100,000 tons of canadian wheat out of shipments at present destined for the UnitedKingdom,  and points out that if this is to bo of the maximum benefit to India it must arrive in India in November or earlyDecember.2.      My colleagues may wish to have from mo an appreciation ofthe shipping aspects of this problem and of the other pointsma.de in the Secretary of State&apos;s paper.      The diversion of100,000 tons of Canadian wheat from the United Kingdomprogramme to arrive in India during November and earlyDecember would require October sailings from Canada.      Of theships in a position to load in October in Canada there are at most eight ships with cargo carrying capacity of 65/70,000 tons which arc suitable for diversion and could make October sailing.There is at the moment considerable congestion of shipping jbithe St. Lawrence owing to a hold up in the transport arrangements for moving grain from the Groat Lakes to seaboard,and this is so retarding the rate of loading that I have had toreduce outward sailings against present programmes.      If it is decided to divert 100,000 tons of wheat from Canada, to India,I would do my best to make up the balance not covered by october sailings by ships sailing in early November.     these would make late December arrival in India.3.      The Secretary of State refers to the serious situationcaused by the. United States seamen&apos;s strike.      The  shipping to cover the 275,000 tons of cereals which wore scheduled for shipment from the United States in September,  can only boprovided by United States ships, which I will do my best toobtain, but the strike has made it impossible  to say how muchof this programme will arrive in India before the end ofNovember,    &apos; We certainly could not hope to get more than the, Secretary of State&apos;3 estimate of 100,000 tons.

h.      So for as the Argentine is con go mod, even if theGovernment of Indie wore successful in securing immediatelyexport licences for the remaining 130.000 tons of maize, itWould be Impossible for me to provide ships in the Argentineto cover this amount in full before November at the earliestNovember loading would mean January arrival in India.      Ofthe ships nominated against the October programme from theArgentine to the United Kingdom, not more than three are suitable for diversion to India.A   P,Ministry of Transport.1ST OCTOBER;,   19*4-6.
