cabinet war  OFFICE REQUIREMENTS  OF land memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR war as my colleagues in the Cabinet will be aware, the Prime Minister charged theMinister of Town and Country Planning in November, 1945, with co-ordinating theland requirements of the three Services with those of the Civil Departments. An Inter-Departmental Committee is now engaged on a comprehensive review of all service requirements, and is about to consider in detail the requirements of my department for training areas.In view of the publicity given to the subject as the result of the debate in theHouse of Lords on 4th July, 1946, and bearing.in mind that intimation has alreadybeen received of another motion in the House of Lords on the same subject early inNovember, I feel that I must at this stage seek the approval of my colleagues to two points, one general and one particular.The requirements of the War Department for land for training the Army are relatively large, and are necessarily so by reason of modern conditions and weapons.The general purposes for which training areas are required are covered in thememorandum on training at Appendix A, and I invite the approval of my colleagues to the principles therein set out and to the general scale of training areas proposed.The main points to which I draw attention are:  (i) training of personnel located in the United Kingdom must be done in theUnited Kingdom. It is impracticable to send such personnel overseas fortheir training;(ii) the use of live ammunition in training schemes must be accepted, and trainingwhich combines this with the co-operation of all arms is essential;(iii) the most economical use of land for training involving the co-operation of allarms is obtained by setting aside certain large areas, known as PracticalTraining Areas, where all forms of training can be carried out.I must stress the point that the Army requirements of land for training purposeshave been carefully considered by the Inter-Service Co-ordinating Committee on LandRequirements, together with those of the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and theMinistry of Supply. Particular attention has been paid to ensuring economy by themaximum possible joint use of training areas. This co-ordination by the Services hasresulted in a very considerable decrease in the amount of land required.The particular point is in relation to the promises (explicit or implicit) made tothe inhabitants evicted from certain requisitioned areas, at the time of their eviction,that they should return to their homes at the end of the war. There are two such areas which the War Department wishes to keep, where specific promises are alleged,namely the Stanford Battle Training Area in East Anglia and the East Holme (Lulworth)R.A.C&apos; School Gunnery Range. I think, however, it is safe to assume that in nearly every case where land was requisitioned during the war by any Department, eventhough no eviction of inhabitants took place, those from whom the land was takenwere assured that they would get it back when the emergency was over; and anywaythat was the law. I attach at Appendix B a note on the legal position regarding thesepromises. In my view, however, rather than take our stand on the legal position, weshould stand on the hard ground that the essential needs of the defence of the realmdictate that these areas should continue to be used by the War Department. It is highly undesirable to create a double disturbance by allowing these people to returnand then evicting them again or evicting others from another area. It would be far better to admit that national expediency, resulting from the experience of the warand due to conditions which have changed since these areas were requisitioned, nowrequires that the inhabitants should not return to the homes which they left four yearsago.Printed for the Cabinet, October, 1946SECRET- Copy No.   29CP. (46) 37210       18th October, 1946
I invite my colleagues to agree:  (i) that there is a necessity for the War Department to have training areas on thescale proposed in the attached memorandum;(ii) that, subject to co-ordination with the other interested Departments on theInter-Departmental Committee on Services Land Requirements, the WarOffice shall be empowered to acquire such lands as it needs;(iii) that considerations of the requirements of national defence due to modern conditions and war experience shall override any promises made in respectof such lands to evicted inhabitants that they should return to their homesafter the war.F. J. B.The War Office,18th October, 1946.APPENDIX &quot; A &quot; to CP. (46) 372LAND REQUIRED FOR TRAINING THE POST WAR ARMY1. This memorandum summarizes the factors involved in deciding on the land required for training the Army in the United Kingdom and gives the reasons for the required acreage which has been set out in a schedule of requirements sent to the Ministryof Town and Country Planning for consideration by the Inter-Departmental Committeeon Services Land Requirements.2. Background.(a) Before 1939 Army training was carried out mainly on W.D. owned or leasedland which for all purposes, including accommodation, amounted to some235,000 acres and also on land used &quot; by, courtesy &quot;, or over which the war department had training rights. The use of land &quot; by courtesy &quot; was thencomparatively easy in view of the relatively small number of tracked vehicles.Despite this the Army became very roadbound, battle exercises could not be properly practised and the areas at the Army&apos;s disposal were shown, in thelight of our war experience, to have been quite inadequate. It is hardlynecessary to stress that ineffectiveness in training, caused by inadequatetraining areas in peace, costs many thousands of lives in war.(b) During the war it was found necessary to apply Defence Regulations to 11million acres in order to provide adequate realistic training. Of this total,9 million acres have already been handed back and a further 500,000 acresare waiting clearance of blinds prior to return to their owners. A furtheramount of nearly 750,000 acres is now earmarked to be returned to its former use.3. Present situation.We are now faced with the problem of deciding the minimum acreage which isrequired in the United Kingdom to train the Active and Territorial Armies and when such areas must be obtained.4. Training which must be done in the United Kingdom.(a) While the Active Army is abroad all its training will be carried out overseas.In the course of time some four divisions will, however, be stationed in theUnited Kingdom; on the assumption that compulsory service continues, it isin the units of these divisions that the majority of militiamen will carry out their service.The movement of complete units and formations stationed in the UnitedKingdom to train overseas is impracticable because of the drafting,shipping, and financial implications involved. The Dominions are believed to be unwilling to accept such a commitment. Further, whilst in the UnitedKingdom the formations would still require training areas.(b) Territorial Army units will be carrying out only a fortnights continuous traininga year, and this must obviously take place in the United Kingdom.(c) It is desirable that the basic training of recruits other than militiamen shouldbe carried out in the United Kingdom near their homes.
(d) War Office Schools in the United Kingdom provide the nerve centre of training and thought of the Array in the whole Empire, and are also closely concernedwith research and trials. They possess buildings and equipment which wouldDe difficult and expensive to establish elsewhere.(e) Even if it were practicable for our training organization to be set up abroad inpeace, in the event of war danger to shipping and many other factors would necessitate training being carried out in the &quot;United Kingdom. All the moneyspent on overseas training facilities and equipment would then be lost, andtne complete reprovision ox training establishments and facilities in the UnitedKingdom which would then be necessary would so slow up our readiness forwar at a vital period that it could not be tolerated.The conclusion from (a) to (e) above is that the only training which canbe carried out abroad is the training of that part of the Active Army fromtime to time stationed overseas for other reasons.5. Scale of training for which provision is made in the War Office proposals.(a) In both the Active and Territorial Armies, it is proposed for the present to under-take up to unit (i.e., Battalion, etc.) training only. This will include collectivetraining on a unit basis involving co-operation with other arms. Trainingon any higher scale (e.g., Brigade or Division) will only be in the shape ofskeleton exercises or set-piece drills, and it is not considered justifiable to seekextra land for these purposes. The proposals do not cover large scalemanoeuvres, which would necessitate the Manoeuvre Acts being put intoforce. No large scale manoeuvres are contemplated for some years, andeven then they will only be held at intervals of several years.(6) Basic training for recruits will consist of individual training, including trainingin elementary tactics, in vehicle driving, and the use of ranges.(c) War Office schools will mainly be employed in running instructors&apos; coursesrequiring ranges, demonstration areas and exercise areas in accordance withthe arm of the service.6. Size and type of land required to carry out these commitments.[a) It is obviously desirable to take over only those areas where agriculture, publicamenities and private interests are disturbed as lithe as possible. However,it is essential for most forms of training to have land over which trackedvehicles can move, because modern war entails considerable cross-countrymovement away from roads. On this account, large areas of Scotland,Northern Ireland and Wales are ruled out, as no such cross-country move-ment is possible. Account has been taken of such areas as do exist, but those not already in use lie in remote parts, where further consideration is imprac-ticable because of the accommodation problem, the time factor and weather conditions. Very large building programmes would be required to open upthe areas, and to provide accommodation for the troops, training facilities and recreational amenities. Under present conditions, such programmes are not practicable. The time factor would not allow of distant Territorialunits travelling to these areas for week-end training and occasional exercises.Further, training is to be carried out all the year round, and snow and heavyrain would make such areas impassable for long periods.It is also essential to have regard to the location of existing establish-ments, the removal of which (such as that of the R.A.C. school at Lulworth,which would result from the surrender of East Holme) would involve the waste of millions of pounds of public money and a further impracticablerebuilding task.Territorial Army training areas must be near the men&apos;s homes or oppor-tunities for training will be missed, and vital days will be wasted in travelling.(b) The size of each unit requirement has been carefully considered and in manycases it has been possible for units to share the use of one piece of ground,e.g., Salisbury Plain. This is particularly so in the case of what have been- called Practical Training Areas, which are area$ selected as being particularlysuitable for training involving the co-operation of all arms and the use of live ammunition, and where unrestricted cross-country movement can becarried out.Training will take place continuously throughout the year and the selected areas are the minimum size calculated to be necessary to enable allinfantry and a proportion of other arms, both of the Active and TerritorialArmies, to carry out this type of training once every 12 months. Considera-tion has been given to the possibility of finding one very large area whereall this training could be done. This, however, is precluded by the problemof provision of all the year round accommodation that would be necessaryfor the numbers concerned, and by the difficulties of movement from all parts of the United Kingdom, including the time factor; it would also entail a greater use of good agricultural land than would a number of smaller areas.(26540)
For the above reasons four areas have been designated to cover GreatBritain (Southern Command using areas in other commands). these areas are: approximateacreageStobs Scottish Command      Lowlands 21,500Fylingdales     Northern Command     Yorkshire moors 26,000Stanford Eastern Command      East Anglia 28,000Fforest Fawr   Western Command     South Wales 50,000These Practical Training Areas are the most economical and thesoundest method of training both the Active and the Territorial Armies;without them the training efficiency of the Army must be gravely impaired.(c) In addition to the Practical Training Areas, there are other land requirements for training purposes. For the general training of units, it is necessary toprovide in the vicinity of their barracks areas where general training canbe carried out. Training in fire and movement requires ranges, for small arms and for guns, and the latter demand large acreages both on accountof the great range of modern guns, and the safety areas required for modernshells. There are also the areas required by War Office schools in theirown neighbourhood, for demonstrations and for carrying out their courses.(d) The size of the training areas required amounts in all to some 500,000 acresover and above the 235,000 acres owned or leased before the war and afurther 90,000 acres purchased since the beginning of the war (this figure includes land for accommodation and other purposes). Of the 500,000 acresit is considered that a large proportion will not have to be bought, but canbe leased or secured for use by acquisition of training right. In most casesthis would not involve the total exclusion of the public.7. Retention of land already in use.In most cases the soundest and most economical coui&quot;se is to take land used fortraining during the war.In order to avoid taking up good agricultural land the War Department has,wherever possible, sought undeveloped land of low agricultural value. The chiefargument against the retention of such training areas is the idea current that thepublic access to scenes of natural beauty and to land of historical or scientific interestwill be curtailed or stopped. Such curtailment would only occur when troops were actually using the land or, for reasons of safety, in those areas where blinds are likelyto occur. Thus, the public could have access to most of the land at weekends andon other public holidays.The War Department has spent extremely large sums in setting up installationson much of this land, and in some areas considerable damage has been caused by army use. Compensation in such cases would come to very large sums amountingto a considerable part of the cost of purchase. The surrender at this stage of certainrequisitioned areas would involve the transference elsewhere of W.D. installations (atpresent for labour and material reasons impracticable), and in any event the cost would be very large; for example, the giving up of the East Holme tank gunneryrange would involve the transfer elsewhere of the R.A.C. School at Lulworth, at an estimated cost of several million pounds. Considerable expense would have to be incurred in purchasing new land, which would probably conflict with the needs ofagriculture, and the necessity in certain cases for evicting inhabitants from these new and substituted acquisitions would have to be faced.8. Time of acquisition.As stated, not all this land need be bought, but there is a much greater need forthe land used for training to be W.D. owned than was the case before the war, astracked vehicles and modern battle conditions are so much more destructive to theland.   It is cheaper to buy than to pay recurrent compensation.As the legal provisions which allow the temporary use of land for training lapseon 31st December, 1947, under the Emergency Laws (Transitional Provisions) Act, 1946,it is essential to acquire certain land without delay. It is also important to use theprovisions of the Requisitioned Land and War Works Act, 1945, relating to the price to be paid, which lapse in February, 1948. Areas whose early purchase is requiredare those in use for training at the present time and those where, if the land were returned to the owners, the compensation to be paid would represent a considerable part of the cost of purchase, or those on which much works expenditure has been incurred.Wherever land is purchased for the use of the Active Army, and would not beused immediately by troops at present in the United Kingdom, it would where practicable be leased for agriculture until required for Army use.
APPENDIX &quot; B &quot; to CP. (46) 372PROMISES TO EVICTED INHABITANTSThe question of the pledges, explicit or implicit, which it is alleged were given duringthe war when certain areas of land were requisitioned, to the effect that when the useunder requisition for war-time purposes ceased the land would be restored to itsinhabitants, must be considered.These pledges were brought up in the Debate in the House of Lords on training landduring the last Session and the areas to which they have particular reference are theStanford Battle Training Area and the East Holme extension to the Lulworth TankGunnery Ranges.It is not disputed that various persons in authority, both civil and military, made public statements at the time of the requisitioning of, e.g., the Stanford area whichassumed or implied that the land would be restored to its inhabitants at the end of the requisitioning. The same fact holds good, to a lesser extent, for the East Holme area.These statements were, however, little more than declaratory of what was in fact the legal position so far as the exercise of the requisitioning power under D.R. 51 was concerned,which was that this and other Defence Regulations would expire at the end of theemergency. But no one said, or could possibly have said, that neither the then present government nor any future Government would at any future date find it essential totake that particular land for defence purposes under the Defence Act of 1842, whichcould both before and after the war be applied to acquisitions of land for defence purposes, this being a continuing liability which was clearly not intended to be abrogated:the Defence Acts are part of the permanent legislation of the Realm.Subsequently, in 1945, Parliament passed the Requisitioned Land and War WorksAct, which authorized the retention or acquisition of land requisitioned during the war,after the lapse of the Emergency Powers in certain circumstances. It is not suggestedthat the Requisitioned Land and War Works Act has essentially altered the position asregards the acquisition of these particular areas, since they would, in fact, be acquiredunder the Defence Act of 1842, subject to certain modifications of procedure and of theprice to be paid, laid down in the Requisitioned Land and War Works Act. It mayfairly be observed, however, that Parliament in fact then legislated not merely for theretention of requisitioned land beyond the period contemplated at the time of requisi-tioning, but also made additional provisions for permanent acquisitions under theDefence Act.The case for acquisition does not, however, rest on legalistic interpretations but on broad grounds of public policy. If the need for training land as proposed is accepted,it follows that the War Department must either acquire these particular areas or acquireothers instead. It would be ridiculous to suggest that the War Department should carryout the promises by derequisitioning the areas and restoring the inhabitants, and thenproceeding to acquire them under the Defence Acts. On the other hand the purchaseof new areas would disturb a further section of the population, and would requirepayment both for the restoration of the original training areas and for the purchase ofnew ones.(B4G/13)   no   10/46   W.O.P.   26540
