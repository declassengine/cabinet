THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (36) 395.21st October, 1946.CABINET.INDIAN FOOD REQUIREMENTS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.THE Cabinet at their meeting of the 3rd October* rejected a proposal whichI made for the diversion of Canadian wheat from the United Kingdom to Indiabut invited the Minister of Food to explore with me means whereby India mightobtain increased shipments of cereals from Canada, the United States and theArgentine, with particular reference to Argentine maize and Canadian barley.It was suggested that these increased shipments might possibly form a loan,to be re-paid to the United Kingdom in the New Year.2. As a result of this conclusion, two ships have been diverted from theUnited Kingdom food programme from the River Plate and will shortly loadtwo of the three cargoes of barley which U.N.R.R.A. has placed at the disposalof India. The Ministry of Food do not wish to pursue the suggestion of atemporary loan of cereals to India in return for repayment to the UnitedKingdom in the New Year.3. According to latest estimates, the level of Government-held stocks inIndia will sink to 626 thousand tons (equal to four weeks&apos; off-take) at theend of October, to 561 thousand tons (under four weeks&apos; off-take) at the endof November, and to about 508 thousand tons (just over three weeks&apos;off-take) at the end of December. It would be necessary to ship at least250 thousand tons of cereals to India for arrival during the period November-December, over and above supplies already programmed, in order to bring averagestocks up to the level of five weeks&apos; off-take. The Government of India originallyestimated that their most critical period would be over by December, but thiswas on the assumption that during October-November imports would be muchgreater than will now be possible. Their latest appreciation of the situationshows that the period of acute food shortage will now inevitably extend intothe New Year. They will, of course, continue to need large wheat imports until their rice imports return to normal.4. Additional help on the scale required can come only from North America.The United States Government have included only 59,000 tons of coarse grainfor India in their October-December programme, in addition to the backlogfrom August^September programmes which is held up by the present maritimestrike in the United States. My Department are in consultation with the ForeignOffice and other interested Departments on a proposal for an urgent approach to the United States State Department through the British Embassy atWashington with the object of persuading the United States Government toincrease the cereals programmed to India and other areas of interest to us.We cannot, however, count on much coming of this.5. On the basis of imports at present programmed and even assuming that supplies now held up in the United States by the maritime strike are allshipped within the next three weeks, it seems probable, unless there is a sub-stantial addition to supplies at present programmed, that famine conditions will develop over wide areas in India in November/December.   I feel bound to bring* CM. (46) 84th Conclusions, Minute 3.[32574]
this very dangerous situation once more to the notice of my colleagues, for their information, as we must take it into account in our consideration of the politicaland constitutional situation in India. The food riots which would probablyresult in many areas would be almost certain to take a communal form; and anincrease of communal bitterness and of the strain on the administrative machinemay well bring down the precarious Hindu-Moslem accord just achieved in the composition of the Central Government. If the situation deteriorated into civil war or something approaching it, an incidental but inevitable effect of this wouldbe to decrease, to an incalculable extent, India&apos;s indigenous production and sogreatly to increase and prolong her need for imported cereals.P.-L.India Office, S.W. 1,21st October, 1946.
