(THIS DOCUMENT IS TH2 :&apos;KO?ERTY OF HIS BHIT/JINIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S    5    G    R    E    T.SUPPLIES OF- TIMBER FROM. GlhdLdgf TO THE UNITED kingdom memorandum, by the Lord President of the council.      In my earlier memorandum (Economic Planning:Co-ordination of the German Economy with the United Kingdom)CP. (h6)38h reference is made in paragraph 1 to the exploitation of German timber to relieve the timber shortage.Since this paper was circulated the Lord President&apos;sCommittee have held a meeting on the 18th October(1.1.(1+6) 3hth Meeting, Minute l)and have considered th.position regarding timber supplies for the United kingdom in the light of the allocations made by the Materials&quot;Committee for the current quarter and of the prospects for thefirst half of 191+7.      The current allocations representcuts on recent usuage of about 20 per cent,  for softwoodand&apos;30 per cent,  for hardwood.2.      The Ministers affected by these cuts consider(having studied the implications for their Departments)that the consequences of accepting them are so serious as to call for a searching re-examination of thepossibilities of obtaining additional timber supplies fromGermany, even if drastic changes in policy should benecessary to achieve this end.      The Ministers of health and Works, in particular, point out that work on housesalready put out to contract under the authorised programme will have to be held up owing to lack of timber if theproposed allocation of: timber for housing is enforced,  andthat future contracts will have to be scaled down to aninaccoptably low level in order not to exceed availabletimber supplies.      Grave consequences are also feared in transport and other fields.      It is common ground that thepossibilities of early and substantial increases in timber supplies in ar-as other than Germany are negligible.Ministers concerned,  therefore, consider that a balanceshould now be struck between the sacrifices and difficultiesentailed in an early expansion of supplies from Germany andthe grave economic,  social and political embarrassments athome which will result if allocations of timber for prioritypurposes cannot be improved.CP.

3.      At the request of my colleagues  on the Lord President&apos;sCommittee,  I am submitting to the Cabinet this summary ofthe problem as seen from the internal United Kingdomstandpoint.      It is represented that United Kingdom reserves of timber of all kinds have been ruthlessly denuded in orderto deliver the world from Nazi oppression and that noconsideration of adverse long-term effects  on German forests/j!t,r. should be alloved to stand in the way of meeting priority1 ncoc&quot;ls for reconstruction of the United Kingdom.      It is0^    further argued that the full consequences of telling thea&apos;        British people that housing and other forms of reconstructionare having to be damped down for want of timber which is widely known to be in physical existence in Germany, should be weighed against any political and diplomatic considerations which may be held to render it undesirable to take thonecessary measures to secure additional sup-plies from Germany.The question has been raised whether the existing pattern of;    military and civil administration of tho British Zone meetseconomic noons of this character.      In so far as tholimiting factors arc lack of skilled labour and transport it is asked whether there could not be mobilised, by drawing on all available resources everywhere,  sufficient suitable workers and vehicles to break this bottle-neck with less sacrificethan would be involved by cutting back United Kingdomre-housing and reconstruction at this critical stage.h.      The main &quot;points emerging for consideration by theCabinet appear to me to be:-(l) Whether the administrative set-up in the British zone of Germany could be adapted more closely to economicneeds :Thethor r higher priority should be given to UnitedKingdom re-housing and reconstruction as ac1aira on German resources;(2)(3)  Whether further emergency steps can be taken tofurnish the administration of the British Zonewith such additional resources as would enable agreater -mount of timber to be extracted;(ix) Whether greater use can be made of our bargaining power (for example, in persuading the french to intensify efforts to extract additionaltirn.ber frcm the French Zone).H.
