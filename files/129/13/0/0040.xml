(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE ?!ROIERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E C R E TCP. (46)390COPY NO.18TH OCTOBER1946CABINETSUP-LIES OP TIMBER PROM GERMANY TO THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster i have-seen the Minutes of the Lord President&apos;s Committeeof Friday, 18th October (L. P. (46)34th Mooting) and thememorandum of the Lord President of the Council(C.P. (4-6)388)  on the question of securing furthertimber from Germany.2.      I would once again make it clear that no considerations of a political or diplomatic nature and no considerations of the adverse effects on German forests have been allowed to stand in the way of our cutting the maximum possible quantityof timber in the British Zone of Germany,3.      There is in the Zone, under Sir Gerald Lenanton, themost competent and experienced team for timber production whichthis country can provide.      The target to which this organisation has been working is an  annual export figure ofIf million tons, and it is hoped to achieve this rate by april, 1947.      In the meantime,  timber ex-ports have been increasing steadily, the quantities brought to the ports for shipment during July, August and September being 43?000 tons,55,000 tons and 59,000 tons respectively.      In the presentquarter it is planned to export 267,000 tons,  the Decemberprogramme being 105,000 tons.      The-latter figure includes30,000 tons of logs, 30,000 tons of pitwood, 35,000 tons ofsawn softwood and 10,000 tons of sawn hardwood.      Thequantity of sawn wood included in this programme is limited by    sawmill capacity in the Zone.4.      It has always been recognised that some time would haveto elapse before the annual rate of 1% million tons could be attained, and the organisation of the North German TimberControl, including supervisory staff, skilled and unskilled labour, saw mill equipment and transport equipment ha.s been designed to achieve this programme.      Following a meetingof the Overseas Reconstruction Committee last July, special arrangements were made with the Ministry of&apos;Supply and b. A. O.R.   in regard to the provision of transport vehicles,and these have been going forward as fast as they can be^, absorbed.      The only significant bottle-neck, at present inI accelerating the achievement of the present tan-get is shortageof tyres, principally for Gorman vehicles which can only beI produced in Germany.      To overcome this difficulty1 arrangements have boon made to import into Germany 2,000tons of natural rubber.

5,      As regards labour, arrangements have been made to repatriate skilled forestry workers from among german prisoners of war in this country.      Of the 1,300 availablein this country, 1,000 are being repatriated in November,and 300 in December.      A further 700 unskilled timberworkers are being repatriated in December.      In  the meantime,the maximum use is being made in Germany of skilled forestryworkers from amongst displaced persons,  and over 5,000of these, principally Baits, are now being employed.6.      Since the 19th August the food ration for forestry workershas been at the rate laid down for heavy workers and they arenow receiving 2,781). calories a day, as well as a specialration of cigarettes.7.      As a result  of the fusion with the American Zone, we havebeen exploring the po .sibilities of increasing supplies fromthat Bare a.      The Americans, however, are faced with seriouslabour and transport difficulties.      Moreover, they have noorganisation in their Zone comparable in any way with the NorthGerman Timber Control.      When the  arrangements for operatingthe two Zones as a single economic whole are further developed,it may be possible, by combining our resources,  to increasethe overall export of the two Zones, but no additional quantitites from the American Zone as such are likely tomaterialise in under six months.      So far as the french zone is concerned,  all the timber that is being cut there isbeing used in the Zone or exported to France.      The only way of increasing the timber availability from this Zonewould be by doing the cutting ourselves and we can use our resources more  efficiently in our own Zone, or possibly in the American Zone.8.      I have no hesitation in saying that the progress made during the last two or three months in the production and export of timber from the British Zone represents a most striking achievement,  and reflects great credit on sir Gerald L en ant on and those working with him,      Nevertheless,in view of the gravity of the supply position in the UnitedKingdom, I have asked Sir Gerald Benanton to come to london for consultation as to whether it would be possible to increasethe present very substantial export target,  and,  if so, what additional resources would be required.9.      I must, however, point out that even at the present levelof exports,  the ijuantity of timber available for domestic consumption within the Zone is falling seriously short of requirements.      For the last quarter of 1.9.46, allocations to all categories of users will only represent 35gj of theestimated minimum needs.      For example, supplies ofpulpwood for newsprint, so urgently needed for propaganda purposes,are only 35b; of requireme nts.      We are therefore forcedto import newsprint with a consequent drain on our meagresupplies and financial resources.      Timber shortage is seriously retarding the repair of houses in Germany? whereconditions are probably more serious  than in any other part of world, particularly in the Ruhr.      It is also affecting the repair of railway wagons which are now earning out of service at the rate of 500 per week in our own Zone alone (2,500 a week in the American Zone).      A continued shortage on this scalemay make impossible the achievement  of the results which theForeign Secretary suggests we should try to obtain in his paperan Germany ( C. i. (46) 383).J. 3.
