l/yO STATEMENT ON THE DEFENCE ESTIMATES

V  Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Defence

I attach the dr,rf &gt;of my 1988 Statement on the Defence Estimates, which

I propose to piMev to Parliament on Tuesday 17 May.    It has been

amended to take^a^on^t of discussion afr. the Overseas Defence Committee

meeting on 17 Harejwi.

2. The Statement recnlfetfKthe decisive conclusion, in last year&apos;s

General Election, of va j?a$aestic debate on Trident and reviews our

security concerns in the Vai$^of the INF Treaty.    It reaffirms the need

for an effective nuclear&lt; fo H tJt in NATO strategy, which was dealt with

in detail in SDE 87, and M u**s particularly on conventional defence in

Europe and Chemical Warfare,/Tsf^ecting NATO&apos;s future arms control

priorities.

3. Chapter 1 sets out our def an^eyolicy in the context of recent

international developments, in parfr^e^Jar, the INF Treaty and improved

East-West relations.    It records cfie^rjraf f irmation by the NATO summit of

the Alliance&apos;s deterrent policy andCfji^^&amp;ecision to keep all NATO&apos;s

forces, conventional and nuclear, upl&amp;yrLaXe.    Chapter 2 records the

progress made in arms control and aet&amp;tifpz NATO&apos; 8 priorities for the

future.   Chapter 3 describes the roles ,^\ctivities and equipment of the

armed forces.   Chapter 4 reports on procurement policy, including our

efforts to get better value for money through competition and

collaboration with our allies.    Chapter 5 deals^jith the management of

defence resources, and repeats the warning offche^ast two years that

difficult decisions will be required to match^pBLtfG^ties to the

resources available; but the commitment to maintmninfeour main defence

roles is reaffirmed.    Chapter 6 (Annex A in prevrw*sVyears) contains the

usual analysis of the East-West military balance.

4.     Four essays provide the now customary opportunity ro^jscuss

topical issues in greater depth.    Three deal with aspec^v^J^v

conventional defence. &quot;Soviet Military Doctrine&quot; looks a^^oyjlet

strategy for the conduct of war in Europe and its implicarwKS^ior us.

&quot;The Forward Defence of Europe&quot; describes this important el^mev^of NATO

strategy for the first time fully in a White Paper.    &quot;The CorwJiwiQna 1

Balance&quot; seeks to rebut those critics who claim that the Warsaw/*&gt;c v&apos;s

numerical advantage in conventional forces is offset by NATO&apos;s sy^S

technological lead.    The fourth essay &quot;Procurement;    Keeping up wCth/^ie


Times&quot; describes the measures taken in recent years to achieve better

Rvalue for money in equipping the armed forces.

^^S.     As usual, the text also includes a number of boxes to highlight

o^tfkjects of interest.    And the printed version will incorporate a number

V^4f/presentational improvements including colour photographs and an

yT&amp;tfsw&apos;ated front cover.

6. &lt;^&gt;^hall aim to remove the last remaining square brackets by the

time^afetr^et meets on 14 April.

CHAPTER ONE: MAINTAINING SECURITY IN A CHANGING WORLD

THE DUAL APPROACH

101. The last year has seen continued improvement in the atmosphere of East-West

relations and important achievements for NATO&apos;s strategy for peace. At the end of

1987, the two elements of the Alliance&apos;s balanced security policy - strength in defence

and readiness for dialogue - brought about the first ever negotiated reduction in nuclear

weapons. At their summit meeting in Brussels in March this year, NATO Heads of State

and Government reaffirmed the validity of this dual approach, and reasserted the vital

importance of the Alliance&apos;s strategy of deterrence, as the guarantee of our collective

security. It was thus a successful year for NATO and for British defence policy,

confirming our policies on the course that we and our allies must follow to maintain

security in a changing world.

102. A year of unprecedented progress in arms control discussions between the United

States and Soviet Union culminated in the signature, in December 1987 at the

Washington summit between President Reagan and Mr Gorbachev, of the historic treaty

eliminating US and Soviet ground-launched intermediate-range nuclear (INF) missiles.

As the NATO summit agreed, this is a milestone in the Alliance&apos;s efforts to achieve a

more secure peace, and the result of the political courage, realism and unity of its

members. Soviet leaders were brought to the conference table because NATO

deployed, in the face of much opposition, limited numbers of INF missile systems

comparable to those already deployed by the Soviet Union. Unilateral gestures could

never have achieved the same result. Indeed, had such gestures been made, we would

face today the increased threat from Soviet missiles, with no countervailing force on

the Western side.

103. The last year also saw the successful introduction of the confidence- and

security-building measures agreed at the Stockholm Conference of 1986. And there was

encouraging progress in other areas of arms control including, particularly, US-Soviet

negotiations on strategic nuclear weapons, where there is now the prospect of

agreement on a treaty reducing superpower armouries by 50%. Further details are

given in Chapter 2.


CONFIDENTIAL

There is such a horror of war in the great nations who passed through

Armageddon that any declaration or public speech against armaments, although

it consisted only of platitudes and unrealities, has always been applauded; and

any speech or assertion that set forth the blunt truth has been incontinently

relegated to the category of &apos;war monger&apos; .... The cause of disarmament will not

be obtained by Mush, Slush and Gush. It will be advanced steadily by the

harassing expense of fleets and armies, and by the growth in confidence in a long

peace.&apos;

Winston Churchill,

1932

Developments in the Soviet Union

104. We are now also at last beginning to see signs of change in the Soviet Union,

reflected elsewhere in Eastern Europe. At home, Mr Gorbachev has set in train a series

of wide-ranging reforms. Abroad, he has argued the need for &apos;new political thinking&apos; in

the nuclear and space age, and has laid stress on the growing interdependence of the

countries of the world community. This &apos;new thinking&apos; acknowledges that there is more

to security than military might and that Soviet security cannot be maintained on terms

that inevitably mean insecurity for others.

105. The British Government has welcomed the reforms that are taking place in the

Soviet Union. More open internal policies, which bring the Soviet people more

information about their own country and the world outside, are self-evidently desirable.

And more pragmatic, less aggressive, external policies ought to make the Soviet Union

a less uncomfortable neighbour. Certainly, as the Prime Minister&apos;s meeting with

Mr Gorbachev at RAF Brize Norton in December 1987 again showed, we are now able to

pursue our bilateral dealings with the Soviet Union in an atmosphere that is more open

and constructive than before.

106. Although it would be imprudent to rely on a sustained change in Soviet attitudes,

the prospect of its taking place is a challenge that the West must accept. The

willingness of the present Soviet leadership to take part in the mutual concessions

necessary to achieve an INF agreement is a good sign. But these are early days and we

shall be looking for hard evidence, in the form of actions rather than words, that the

&apos;new thinking&apos; represents a genuine and lasting shift in Soviet policy towards the West,

and not merely a new approach to the presentation and execution of old policies.

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

Progress in arms control has not yet been matched by comparable steps over issues such

as [regional conflicts and] human rights, equally important for the creation of lasting

confidence between East and West.

107. Nor has there been any let-up in the Soviet Union&apos;s military modernisation

programmes, described in Chapter 6. By the mid-1990s virtually the entire Soviet

strategic nuclear force in place in the mid-1980s will have been replaced by new or

modernised systems. And the Soviet Union is continuing to modernise its theatre

nuclear forces in Europe, where even after the INF Treaty is implemented it will

continue to enjoy a huge numerical advantage; improvements include the introduction

of more accurate shorter-range nuclear missiles and the deployment of more advanced

nuclear-capable aircraft, which will soon carry new nuclear-capable stand-off missiles.

The Soviet Union continues to enjoy very substantial advantages in conventional forces,

and is updating them so effectively that in key areas, such as aircraft and armour, the

West&apos;s technological lead is being eroded (see page [ ]). Soviet capabilities for

chemical warfare (see page [ ]) far outstrip those of the West and cannot be justified

by any comparable threat from NATO. These Soviet forces are all deployed and

structured in such a way as to give them a capability for offence and surprise (see

page [ ]).

108. There is no reason to believe that Soviet leaders want war in Europe. But the

Soviet Union has not in the past been reluctant to exploit the threat or use of force to

achieve its political ends. And its avowed aim of removing all nuclear weapons from

Europe would expose the countries of Western Europe to the intimidating power of

Soviet superiority in conventional and chemical forces, which could be used in attempts

to impose Soviet will.

&apos;Reflecting upon almost four decades of common endeavour and sacrifice and upon the

results achieved, we are confident that the principles and purposes of our Alliance

remain valid today and for the future. We are united in our efforts to ensure a world of

more secure peace and greater freedom. We will meet the opportunities and challenges

ahead with imagination and hope, as well as with firmness and vigilance. We owe no

less to our peoples.1

The   Declaration   of  the  Heads  of  State  and Government

participating in the meeting of the North Atlantic Council,

Brussels,

3 March 1988


CONFIDENTIAL

The NATO Response

109. It was against this background that NATO leaders met in Brussels in March to

take stock of the situation facing the Alliance and to set guidelines for future action.

At that meeting they reaffirmed that:

the link between the European and North American allies was vital to the

security of each (see paragraph 112);

NATO defences should remain strong, recognising the crucial role of the

nuclear deterrence provided not just by the United States&apos; strategic

deterrent but also by the presence of effective and up-to-date nuclear

weapons in Europe (see [below]);

they were willing to seek dialogue with the countries of the Warsaw Pact

and further arms control agreements (see Chapter 2), based on their

confidence in a sure defence.

In particular, all the NATO leaders agreed that, for the forseeable future, there was no

alternative to the Alliance&apos;s policy of deterrence based on an appropriate mix of

adequate and effective nuclear and conventional forces, and expressed their resolve to

keep them up to date where necessary.

110. NATO&apos;s deterrent policy is carried out through the strategy of forward defence

(see page [ ]) and flexible response. Effective conventional forces will remain an

important element in this strategy; but, however strong, they cannot achieve

deterrence alone. So long as the West faces an adversary armed with nuclear weapons,

it is self-evident that we must retain a similar capability to deter him from using or

threatening to use them. More fundamentally, the need for the nuclear element in

deterrence rests on the imperative to avoid any further war in Europe, conventional or

otherwise; for even conventional weapons, of the power now available, would bring

destruction on an unprecedented scale. The achievement of conventional parity would

make an important contribution to enhancing international security. But even if an

equal balance of conventional forces were to be reached, it could not be relied on to

prevent aggression. History offers many examples of attacks launched against the odds;

for example, when Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 his forces were substantially

outnumbered. For the foreseeable future, only nuclear weapons will be able to confront

a potential aggressor with risks so unacceptable that aggression is no longer a rational

option.

CONFIDENTIAL

111. This reality is recognised in the arms control priorities endorsed at the NATO

summit, and in particular in the reaffirmation by NATO leaders that further reductions

in nuclear weapons, after the reduction in US and Soviet strategic arms now under

negotiation, would come about only in conjunction with the establishment of conven-

tional balance and the global elimination of chemical weapons.

NUCLEAR FORCES IN EUROPE

1. The INF Agreement will remove NATO&apos;s Pershing II and ground-launched cruise

missiles, but will not affect the validity or credibility of the strategy of flexible

response. Even after the agreement is implemented, substantial numbers of nuclear-

capable delivery systems will still be assigned to NATO&apos;s Supreme Allied Commander

Europe (SACEUR).

2. These remaining systems will have to be structured effectively to ensure that

they remain a balanced and survivable force. There will also continue to be a need,

articulated in the decisions of the NATO Nuclear Planning Group meeting in Montebello

in 1983 and reaffirmed at the NATO summit in March 1988, to keep these forces up to

date, so that the West can maintain deterrence with the minimum number of warheads.

3. There is nothing new in all this; it circumvents neither the letter nor the spirit of

the INF Agreement - a fact clearly recognised by the Soviet Union in its own

modernisation programme (see Chapter 6); nor is it inconsistent with reducing the

number of nuclear weapons in Europe, which is already 2,400 less than in 1979. It is

rather part of the normal, continuing process of review and, if necessary, adjustment to

ensure that NATO&apos;s forces remain effective and credible. As in the past the United

Kingdom will play its full part in this process.

[Figure 1 will appear here]

THE EUROPEAN PILLAR

112. A strong and stable partnership between the two sides of the Atlantic, resting

on shared values and interests, lies at the heart of our security. As we explained in last

year&apos;s Statement, neither North America nor Western Europe could carry the full

burden alone. The presence in Europe of the conventional and nuclear forces of the

United States plays an irreplaceable part in the defence of Europe and provides the

essential linkage with the US strategic deterrent. Conversely the credibility of Allied

defence cannot be maintained without a major European contribution.


CONFIDENTIAL

113. That European contribution is substantial. The defence expenditure of European

NATO countries has steadily increased, and is now around one-third higher in real terms

than it was in the early 1970s, enabling Europe to improve the quality of its forces. The

European nations provide some 90% of the manpower, 85% of the tanks, 95% of the

artillery, and 80% of the combat aircraft stationed in Europe, as well as 70% of the

major warships readily available in the event of a conflict. European standing forces

currently comprise over 3.5 million men and women, compared with US forces totalling

350,000 in Europe and 2.3 million worldwide. The active duty reserves of the European

countries total 3.2 million men, compared with a US total of 1.7 million. Europe&apos;s aim

is to make better use of the substantial resources it already devotes to the Alliance by

more effective cooperation in defence and security matters; a more cohesive European

effort can make a greater contribution to the Alliance than the sum total of our

individual national efforts.

114. There has been extensive activity in the field of European security cooperation

during the last year. The potential of the revitalised Western European Union (WEU)

was demonstrated by a series of meetings, under its auspices, which helped to concert

contributions by member states to mine-clearance operations in the Gulf (see page

[ ]). Although it has no role in either operational deployments or force planning, the

WEU can provide a valuable forum for coordinating policy on such out-of-area issues.

115. The WEU also met twice in 1987 at Ministerial level, in Luxembourg in April and

in The Hague in October. These opportunities for both Defence and Foreign Ministers

jointly to discuss European security issues are a unique feature of the WEU. The

meeting in October was marked by the publication of the Platform on European

Security Interests, which set out how the seven member states intend to contribute to

NATO&apos;s future security. It included their commitment to maintain credible and

effective deterrence, based on both nuclear and conventional defences, and to pursue an

active arms control policy aimed at enhancing security and fostering stability and

cooperation in the whole of Europe. The platform will provide a basis for the

development of the WEU as a forum for harmonising Western Europe&apos;s defence effort in

support of the Alliance. The United Kingdom will continue to contribute constructively

to this work when we take on the Presidency of the WEU in July this year.


CONFIDENTIAL

&apos;We are each determined to carry our share of the common defence in both the

conventional and the nuclear field, in accordance with the principles of risk- and

burden-sharing,  which  are  fundamental to  allied  cohesion......        We remain

determined to pursue European integration including security and defence and to

make a more effective contribution to the common defence of the West.&apos;

The Common Platform on European Security Interests,

WEU Ministerial Council,

27 October 1987.

116. The two meetings of Eurogroup Ministers in 1987 provided an opportunity for

informal discussion of defence planning issues from a European perspective. The

progress of the Independent European Programme Group (IEPG) in pursuing European

armaments cooperation is described in paragraphs 408-411.

117. The European allies continue to strengthen their already close bilateral defence

relations. At the Anglo-French summit in January 1988 a number of proposals for

greater bilateral military cooperation were discussed, their purpose being to strengthen

the collective defence arrangements of the Alliance. These include the further

development of existing plans for wartime reinforcement that involve the use of French

facilities, and the scope for closer French involvement in the forward defence of the

Federal Republic of Germany. In addition, we have reached agreement with France on

defence of the Channel fixed link, and set up arrangements for obtaining better value

for money in procurement (see paragraph 415). The Government welcomes bilateral

arrangements that contribute to the collective defence of NATO, and will continue to

seek such opportunities wherever they arise.

BRITISH DEFENCE POLICY

118. British defence policy remains founded on membership of NATO. We cannot

ensure our security other than through the collective strength of the Alliance. Last

year the British electorate again endorsed NATO&apos;s policy of deterrence based on a mix

of nuclear and conventional weapons, and decisively settled the debate about the

maintenance of an independent British strategic deterrent. The Trident programme

remains on course to provide the necessary updating of that capability from the mid-

19905 (see page [ ]).


CONFIDENTIAL

119. Chapter 5 gives details of our defence budget, which, at  19,215 million in 1988-

89, is among the highest in NATO whether measured in absolute terms, as a percentage

of gross domestic product or per capita. Chapter 3 describes how this money is spent

by our armed forces. Over 95% of the defence budget goes, directly or indirectly,

towards carrying out our main defence roles in NATO (see paragraph 302). The great

majority of our forces are committed to one or other of the three main NATO

commands, Europe, Atlantic and Channel; and we remain the only European member of

the Alliance to contribute to all three elements of NATO&apos;s triad of forces: strategic

nuclear, theatre nuclear and conventional.

120. We also have important defence commitments outside the NATO area, described

in paragraphs 326-330. They include a direct responsibility for the defence of our

remaining dependent territories. They also include activities such as the protection of

our merchant shipping in the Gulf, military assistance to foreign and Commonwealth

countries and contributions to international peace-keeping, which help to achieve the

Government&apos;s foreign policy aim of promoting stability in areas where we have

important economic interests. And since our interests coincide closely with those of

our allies, these efforts make an important contribution to preserving broader Western

interests outside the NATO area. As Figure 13 shows, the cost of these activities is

small compared with the benefits they bring. And in a period of tension or war in

Europe, the men and equipment concerned could be redeployed on NATO tasks.

121. The considerably increased sums allocated to the defence budget since 1979 have

enabled us to set in hand substantial enhancements to our conventional forces (see

page[ ]), the benefits of which are now beginning to be seen and will continue to be

felt well into the 1990s. At the same time, we are pressing on with our efforts to

achieve the best possible value for money in the management of defence resources (see

Chapter 5), and in the procurement of equipment for the armed forces (see Chapter 4

and page [ ]).

122. There can be no doubt about the Government&apos;s determination to take the

measures necessary for our national defence. We have charted a clear and consistent

course for the past nine years. The task now is to move ahead steadily on that course,

benefiting from the considerable progress that we have already made.

ESSAY

SOVIET MILITARY DOCTRINE

&apos;Military doctrine: a system of views, adopted in a country at a given time, on the

nature, aims and character of a possible future war, on the preparation of the

country and its armed forces for it, and on the methods of waging it.&apos;

Soviet Military Encyclopaedic Dictionary 1986, page 240.

1. Successive Statements on the Defence Estimates have described NATO strategy

in its various aspects. This essay looks at the other side of the coin, at the equivalent

Soviet thinking, which differs fundamentally from our own.

2. In the West, the concept of strategy, as a plan of action for the conduct of war,

has a long and distinguished history. We have not, however, developed any universally

applicable theoretical structure for the organised study of war. In the West the term

&apos;military doctrine&apos;, if it is used at all, generally means tactical principles and

regulations, a set of guidelines for the tactical commander, or a list of principles to

stimulate original and creative thought. In contrast, the Soviet concept of military

doctrine, as the above definition makes clear, is both systematic and markedly more

comprehensive in its scope.

3. Soviet military doctrine provides a strict theoretical model, which is universally

applied throughout the Warsaw Pact as the military element of Marxist-Leninist

doctrine. The same principles of war, of operations and tactics, are understood by all

military arms and services, by weapons designers and research staff and by Communist

Party officials. And the doctrine is not just applicable on the battlefield. It

encompasses the whole spectrum of the state&apos;s planning for war, including the

preparation of the population, the organisation of the economy and the principles of

foreign policy (including arms control negotiations).

Soviet operational art, ie that part of doctrine that deals with the conduct of

operations on the battlefield, has its roots in a long-standing tradition of defending the

homeland by taking the offensive. Hitler&apos;s invasion of the Soviet Union was defeated by

a war of rapid manoeuvre in which, in successive battles, Soviet forces were concen-

trated in mass to break through German lines at their weakest points and to encircle

and destroy the enemy.


CONFIDENTIAL

5. Soviet concepts for the use of their armed forces in a war with NATO have

inevitably changed over the last 40 years. Under Stalin, such a conflict was visualised

largely as a rerun of the Second World War, with protracted land campaigns in which

ground forces and conventional weapons would predominate; nuclear weapons, as they

became available, were seen as no more than an extension of traditional artillery and

aerial bombardment. Khrushchev, however, believed that the development of strategic

nuclear missiles meant that nuclear weapons could be decisive in their own right, and

that conventional forces would be required mainly to exploit their success and occupy

territory. Then in the mid-1960s - concurrently with, and perhaps partly in response to,

NATO&apos;s evolving strategy of flexible response - it came to be accepted that there might

be an initial conventional phase to any future war, and that NATO&apos;s resistance would be

maintained even in the nuclear phase. This resulted in a renewed emphasis on the need

for conventional forces, and the heavy Soviet investment in recent years in developing

an ability to wage a successful war in Europe without necessarily having recourse to

nuclear weapons.

6. There has recently been further debate in the Soviet Union about the conduct of

any war with NATO. For example, statements by Soviet strategists have played down

the long-held concept that the Socialist countries could only be defended against an

aggressive NATO by adopting an operationally offensive posture; but their statements

do not suggest that their belief in the need to possess such a capability has yet been

abandoned. This offensive capability continues to be reflected in the operational art and

structure of Warsaw Pact forces today. And it explains why they have seen a need for

large preponderances over NATO in conventional weaponry, especially in offensive

systems such as tanks and mobile artillery (see Chapter 6).

7. Soviet thinking on operational art stresses five aspects in particular:

Surprise and deception. Operationally, surprise is seen as necessary to

deceive the Alliance as to the timing of the blow; the scale, scope and axis

of the offensive; and, if possible, the weaponry and techniques that will be

used. Surprise, by conferring the initiative and pre-empting the establish-

ment of a stable defence, is seen as a force multiplier enabling the Warsaw

Pact to impose its style of war-fighting on the enemy.

Speed. Exploiting surprise, the Warsaw Pact would intend to advance at

high speed (averaging 40km to 60km a day), disrupting and fragmenting the

defence. By moving more swiftly than NATO could gather intelligence, take

decisions and act on them, it would aim to prevent the Alliance from making


CONFIDENTIAL

timely and effective counter-moves. A rapid advance would be planned so

as to reduce the danger of NATO resorting to nuclear weapons, by curtailing

decision-making time, disrupting command and control, and making

targeting difficult because of the intermingling of friendly and enemy

forces. A rapid advance would also be expected to induce psychological and

political collapse in some members of the Alliance.

Concentration. With surprise achieved, the Warsaw Pact would not expect

to need a large overall superiority to secure its strategic objectives. This is

because it would aim to exploit its possession of the initiative to

concentrate considerable local superiority (in a ratio of, perhaps, four or

five to one) against vulnerable sectors, thereby achieving a rapid break-

through and generating operational momentum.

Deep operation. The Warsaw Pact would aim to attack throughout NATO&apos;s

operational depth, the aim being to bring about a simultaneous collapse of

front and rear, so as to enable NATO&apos;s stronger groupings to be encircled

and destroyed. Thus, while the main forces advanced westwards, air and

conventional missile attacks, special purpose forces, air- and sea-delivered

troops and operational manoeuvre groups would attempt to erode the

- defence from the flanks and behind by disrupting NATO&apos;s nuclear capability,

command and control facilities , reinforcements and logistics.

Air Superiority. A large proportion of NATO&apos;s nuclear weapons is air-

delivered (and this proportion will increase when the INF Treaty is

implemented). Soviet doctrine therefore envisages, as a first priority task

for all arms, the conduct of an offensive air operation, coincident with the

ground forces&apos; offensive, aimed at neutralizing NATO&apos;s theatre nuclear

capability in Europe within the first few days of a conflict. This air

operation would require the achievement of a measure of air superiority by

attacks on NATO&apos;s nuclear-associated and air defence airfields, surface-to-

air missile units and command and control facilities.

8. Warsaw Pact strategy, organisation and equipment are designed to prosecute

operations at the conventional level. But the Soviet Union also continues to maintain

and improve its nuclear weapons and associated delivery systems, thereby ensuring a

continued ability to launch retaliatory or pre-emptive strikes at all levels, should

circumstances so demand. Together with nuclear weapons, chemical weapons (see page

[ J) are classed by the Soviet Union as &apos;weapons of mass destruction&apos;, but they could be


CONFIDENTIAL

used separately from, and possibly in advance of, nuclear release. Even in peacetime I

the Soviet Union has over 30,000 specialised vehicles and over 70,000 personnel in the I

armed forces specially equipped and trained for operations in a contaminated I

environment.

9. The essentially defensive purpose of these offensive tactics has long been stated

in Soviet military doctrine.   Soviet and Warsaw Pact leaders have stressed the same I

point; and, as we note in Chapter 1, Soviet leaders now acknowledge that their security

cannot be maintained on terms that inevitably mean insecurity for others.  There is no I

reason to believe that they intend to start a war against Western Europe. Nonetheless,

the effect of the doctrine has been to create in Eastern Europe a force that remains

structured, equipped and trained for offence and surprise. The Warsaw Pact thus has a

capability that could be used for aggressive purposes if Soviet intentions should change, I

without the necessity for any action to be taken that might signal such a change.

10. This Warsaw Pact offensive capability lies at the root of NATO&apos;s concerns for the

security of Western Europe. Hopes that the Warsaw Pact approach might change have

been encouraged by statements of the Pact&apos;s political leadership. For example, when

Pact leaders met in Berlin on 28-29 May 1987, they spoke of an arms control process

leading to reductions of conventional forces and the elimination of disparities in Europe

to a level at which both sides would be able to ensure their security, while neither

would have the means to mount a surprise attack on, or conduct offensive operations

against, the other. And similar thinking has been reflected in more recent statements

by Soviet leaders. This apparent wish to reach an agreement on conventional forces in

Europe is welcome. But the simultaneous assertion by the Warsaw Pact that a broad

parity in total capability exists must be measured against the imbalance of forces in

favour of the Warsaw Pact described in Chapter 6. The redress of imbalances in

conventional forces will be the major NATO aim when the new negotiations on

conventional stability in Europe begin (see paragraphs 212 to 215).

CHAPTER TWO: ARMS CONTROL

201. The INF Treaty signed in December was the arms control highlight of 1987. But

progress was also made towards the other arms control priorities endorsed by NATO

Ministers at Reykjavik in June 1987 and reaffirmed by NATO leaders at their summit

meeting in March 1988 (see paragraph 221). This chapter records the progress made and

discusses the Alliance&apos;s aims for the future.

NUCLEAR ARMS CONTROL

Intermediate Nuclear Forces

202. An INF agreement has long been a NATO priority. The treaty, which is subject

to ratification, provides for the elimination of all US and Soviet ground-launched

missiles with a range between 500 km and 5,500 km. To that end it requires the Soviet

Union to destroy deployed systems capable of carrying some 1,700 nuclear warheads

compared with about 400 on the US side, ending a huge asymmetry in favour of the

Soviet Union. It also involves highly intrusive verification measures. In both respects

the agreement is a major advance, and sets a good precedent for further arms control

agreements that can enhance stability and security.

203. The agreement is between the United States and the Soviet Union, and involves

only their systems. But the United States has fully consulted its NATO allies at all

stages and on all important matters. The United Kingdom has played an active and

prominent role in these consultations; and, as one of the five European countries in

which US systems are based, is directly involved in the implementation of the treaty.

An Exchange of Notes between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, and a Basing

Country Agreement between ourselves and the United States, both signed in

December 1987, set out the terms and procedures for verification inspections by Soviet

representatives at the two bases in the United Kingdom involved in the arrangements:

RAF Greenham Common and RAF Molesworth. These bases will be subject to Soviet

inspection for 13 years after the agreement enters into force to establish that the

cruise missile capability is eliminated, and is not surreptitiously resurrected. The

United States will have similar rights in the Soviet Union and in Eastern European

countries where relevant Soviet missiles have been based. The history of the

negotiations, and details of the treaty&apos;s implementation, are described below.


CONFIDENTIAL

INF: THE MAKING OF A TREATY ............

1. In the late 1970s, NATO faced an increasing disadvantage in theatre nuclear

weapons. The Soviet Union was rapidly deploying new and capable systems -particularly

the SS-20 missile, which could hit all Western Europe from sites deep in the Soviet

Union. At the same time, NATO&apos;s longer-range INF (LRINF) systems were ageing and

becoming increasingly vulnerable.

2. NATO saw a danger that the Soviet Union might come to believe that its long-

range theatre forces could be used to threaten Western Europe, without a credible

means of Alliance response. This could have put at risk a central tenet of NATO

strategy - the need to possess an appropriate range of credible deterrent options. The

challenge was to the political as much as the military strength of the Alliance.

3. In late 1979, therefore, NATO responded by deciding to deploy Pershing II and

ground-launched cruise missiles (GLCMs), while at the same time making clear its

willingness to negotiate limitations on this class of missile. In 1981, this concept was

embodied in the Alliance&apos;s so-called zero option, which involved elimination of the SS-

20s, Pershing lis, GLCMs, and all other Soviet and US ground-launched missiles with a

similar range, together with provisions to prevent circumvention by deployment of

shorter-range missiles. The Soviet Union replied with a proposal whose effect would

have been to block NATO deployments and preserve a Soviet monopoly of INF missiles.

4. The negotiations became stalled on variations of these basic positions, and the

United States, in 1983, formally proposed an interim solution, involving parity in the

missile warheads of the two sides, as a step towards the zero solution. This failed to

achieve the necessary progress; the Soviet Union continued to argue, on the basis of

specious comparison of figures, that parity in systems already existed, that US INF

deployments should be cancelled, and that British and French strategic systems should

be included in any agreement. In November 1983, the Soviet Union broke off

negotiations in an attempt to force the West to cancel its INF deployments.

6. Negotiations were eventually resumed in 1985; and at the summit meeting that

November the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to work for an interim INF

agreement. 1986 saw progress on several elements of such an agreement; and when

President Reagan and Mr Gorbachev met at Reykjavik in October the two sides moved

closer to an understanding based on the elimination of all systems in Europe and a

ceiling of 100 warheads elsewhere. The Soviet Union accepted that neither British nor

French strategic systems would be involved; that shorter-range INF(SRINF) missiles

should be part of the deal; and that specific and intrusive verification measures would

have to be worked out. But the Soviet Union also insisted on linking INF to other areas

of arms control, notably to constraints on the US Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)

programme.

7. 1987 saw further progress. The Soviet Union dropped the linkage issue in

February; and in March the United States tabled a draft treaty embodying the progress

made at Reykjavik, including the need for constraints on specified shorter-range

systems. In April, Mr Gobachev responded by proposing elimination of SRINF missiles

in Europe. NATO Ministers welcomed this move in 3une, when they advocated the

global elimination of both LRINF and SRINF missiles - the so-called global double zero

option. This was accepted by Mr Gorbachev in 3uly; and, after further discussion about

the treatment of Federal German Pershing IA missiles with US-owned warheads, and

about verification and phasing, the agreement was signed on 8 December.

8. The final INF Agreement is very similar to the proposal set out by NATO in late

1981: it provides for equality between the United States and the Soviet Union through

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

asymmetrical reductions, addresses only the systems of the two countries, is global in

scope, prevents circumvention by shorter-range systems, and involves stringent veri-

fication. This continuity of approach contradicts Soviet claims that it is Soviet

initiatives that have dominated the arms control agenda. The INF Agreement is a

success for a consistent and firm Western policy, in which clear arms control goals and

force deployments have been pursued together.

.....AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION

1. The treaty will come into effect on the exchange of instruments of ratification by

the United States and the Soviet Union. It provides for the elimination of missiles and

launchers as well as certain support facilities and structures, and for the verification

measures necessary to monitor compliance. The elimination process will be managed in

stages over a three-year period: SRINF elimination in the first 18 months; LRINF in two

phases, in which each side will reduce to 200 warheads in 29 months, and then proceed

to zero.

2. In the United Kingdom these provisions will affect RAF Greenham Common,

where there are 96 operational US GLCMs, and RAF Molesworth, where there are 16.

In addition, there are some spare missile bodies at each base. We expect that RAF

Molesworth will be deactivated, and all the missiles removed, early in the elimination

process. Reductions will also occur in the first phase at RAF Greenham Common, but

some missiles are likely to remain there until near the end of the three-year period.

Training deployments will therefore continue, as necessary, within the agreed

deployment areas established by the treaty. Missiles will be removed to a designated

facility in the United States for destruction. There is no obligation to destroy the

permanent support structures at the two sites.

3. The United States is responsible for its compliance with the treaty. But the

United Kingdom is involved fully in the verification arrangements in this country

through the agreements, described in paragraph 203, governing Soviet inspection

activities. Soviet inspectors will be able to inspect the two GLCM facilities to monitor

compliance with the treaty (see page [ ]). Inspection teams will consist of up to ten

inspectors, drawn from a list acceptable to the British Government. Inspections could

last for up to 90 hours from entry into the United Kingdom to departure. The

inspectors will be escorted at all times by both British and US personnel, and they will

be liable to expulsion by the British Government if they breach agreed terms. The

United Kingdom welcomes these arrangements, which apply reciprocally to US

inspections in the Soviet Union and Eastern European basing countries, as a necessary

part of an effective verification system.

Strategic Arms

204. The last year has also seen significant progress in the negotiations between the

United States and the Soviet Union on 50% reductions in strategic offensive arsenals.

This represents another of NATO&apos;s arms control priorities and the United States has

closely consulted the United Kingdom and other allies as talks have proceeded. At the

summit meeting in Washington in December 1987, it was agreed that the aim should be

to sign a treaty, building on a number of agreed elements. These included:

ceilings of 6,000 strategic nuclear warheads and 1,600 delivery vehicles;

within this, ceilings on ballistic missile warheads of 4,900, and on heavy

ballistic missile warheads of 1,540;

agreed counting rules for the various delivery systems and warheads

covered by these ceilings; and

an intrusive verification system, including the right of on-site inspection,

designed to deal with a regime in which missiles and systems would be

reduced but not, as in the case of the INF Treaty, eliminated.

205. This provides a clear framework for a treaty, and we hope that progress will

continue towards an early agreement. But a number of important issues remain to be

resolved including the treatment of mobile land-based missiles and sea-launched cruise

missiles, counting rules for air-launched cruise missiles, detailed verification measures,

and links with ballistic missile defence research and the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile

(ABM) Treaty.

206. On the latter, the United States and Soviet Union agreed at the Washington

summit to work towards a commitment &apos;to observe the ABM Treaty as signed in 1972,

while conducting their research, development and testing, as required, which are

permitted by the ABM Treaty, and not to withdraw from the ABM Treaty for a

specified period of time1. They also agreed that this commitment would have the same

legal status as a treaty on strategic offensive arms, and that three years before the

expiry of the specified period discussions would begin on strategic stability. If, after

the specified period expired, no other agreement had been reached, both would be free

to decide on their courses of action.

207. Discussions to turn these words into precise agreements are continuing, and

both sides have since proposed texts in the Geneva negotiations. To meet Soviet

concerns about the SDI, the United States has proposed a commitment not to withdraw

from the ABM Treaty until 1994, annual exchanges of information on research

programmes, and other provisions to develop greater mutual predictability in respect of

such programmes. We hope that Mr Gorbachev&apos;s admission, before the summit, that the

Soviet Union is undertaking anti-ballistic missile research similar to the US SDI

programme, signals a determination to reach final agreement on these issues.


CONFIDENTIAL

208. The United Kingdom&apos;s approach to anti-ballistic missile defence research and

associated treaty matters remains based on the agreements reached between the Prime

Minister and President Reagan at Camp David in December 1984 and November 1986,

which together state that:

the SDI research programme which is permitted by the ABM Treaty should

continue;

the US and Western aim is not to achieve superiority, but to maintain

balance, taking account of Soviet developments;

SDI-related deployment would, in view of treaty obligations, have to be a

matter for negotiation;

the overall aim is to enhance, and not to undermine, deterrence;

East-West negotiation should aim to achieve security with reduced levels

of offensive systems on both sides; and

these matters should continue to be subject to close consultation within

the Alliance.

Against this background the United Kingdom fully supports the US SDI research

programme. It is vital to our defence that the West should be at the forefront of new

technology, and able to respond to the comparable and very considerable Soviet

programme.

Nuclear Testing

209. The step-by-step approach to nuclear testing constraints, advocated by

President Reagan in 1986 and agreed by Mr Gorbachev in September 1987, led to

further US-Soviet negotiations, which opened in November. Their aim, as a first step,

is to develop verification arrangements that would allow ratification of the US-Soviet

Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty. To this end

experts from each side visited the other&apos;s nuclear testing sites, at Semipalatinsk in the

Soviet Union and in Nevada in the United States, in January 1988. Discussions continue

on related issues.


CONFIDENTIAL

210. The United Kingdom fully supports, and has consistently advocated, a step-by-

step approach to nuclear testing issues. We support the principle of progress towards

the ultimate goal of a comprehensive test ban, taking account in this of the serious

verification problems that still remain to be resolved. Nuclear weapons will form part

of the Western strategy of deterrence for the foreseeable future; and in the absence of

a comprehensive test ban we shall continue to take all necessary measures, including

periodic testing at the minimum level, to ensure that our deterrent remains credible.

CONVENTIONAL ARMS CONTROL

The Stockholm Document

211. The confidence- and security-building measures agreed in September 1986 at

the Stockholm Conference on Disarmament in Europe, under the auspices of the

Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), have worked well:

In December 1986, the United Kingdom and other participants carried out

the first exchange of annual calendars of planned notifiable military

activities.

During 1987, states participating in the CSCE were invited to send

observers to seven exercises by NATO countries and eight Warsaw Pact

exercises. Of these, British forces were observed in two exercises:

KEYSTONE (see paragraph 305) and PURPLE WARRIOR (see page [ ]).

On both occasions between 30 and 40 observers attended from some 20

countries, including 12 observers from six Warsaw Pact countries. This

was the first time the Warsaw Pact officers concerned had had direct

contact with British soldiers. British officers observed exercises in the

German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.

The provisions for on-site inspections to resolve doubts about compliance

with the agreement were invoked five times during 1987: once each by

the United Kingdom (a Soviet exercise in the German Democratic

Republic in September), the United States (in respect of Soviet activities

in the Minsk area in August), and the German Democratic Republic (an

exercise by the Federal Republic of Germany in November); and twice by

the Soviet Union (the multinational NATO exercise DISPLAY

DETERMINATION in Turkish Thrace and a US exercise in the Federal

Republic, both in October).

CONFIDENTIAL



CONFIDENTIAL

These represent encouraging steps forward. But there is still much to be done to

achieve greater openness about military activities and capabilities.

Conventional Forces in Europe

212. NATO&apos;s aims in future conventional arms control negotiations were set out in

the Brussels Declaration of December 1986. These aims were endorsed and further

elaborated by NATO leaders at their summit meeting in March 1988. They include the

establishment of a stable, secure and verifiable level of forces in the whole of Europe

from the Atlantic to the Urals, aimed at eliminating disparities and reducing

capabilities for surprise attack and large-scale offensive action. The declaration also

called for further negotiations on confidence- and security-building measures, enlarging

on those in the Stockholm Document. Informal discussions between NATO and Warsaw

Pact representatives about a mandate for the new conventional stability talks began in

February 1987. Meanwhile, a review meeting of the CSCE has been looking at ways of

taking forward negotiations on confidence-building. The NATO allies tabled draft

mandates for both sets of negotiations in July 1987.

213. The United Kingdom has played a leading role in developing Alliance

negotiating positions and in the discussions about mandates, which have proceeded in a

business-like atmosphere. Agreement has now been reached on parts of the mandate

for the new conventional stability talks, which, it is hoped, will formally open later this

year. The Western proposals envisage that negotiations on confidence-building will

involve all 35 states of the CSCE, while those on conventional stability will be within

the CSCE framework but limited to the 23 members of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.

214. The Soviet Union now acknowledges both a superiority in tanks and the need to

deal with asymmetries wherever they exist. This is welcome, although it is not yet

accompanied by any recognition of the overall superiority of Warsaw Pact conventional

forces. The provision and serious discussion by both sides of data on force levels will be

essential if progress is to be made towards an agreement. We shall therefore need to

put Soviet words to the test as and when a mandate for the new talks can be agreed and

full negotiations begin.

215. As the NATO summit concluded, the major problem is the Warsaw Pact&apos;s

superiority in key conventional weapon systems. But other asymmetries are also

important, including the Pact&apos;s capability for surprise attack and large-scale offensive

action, based on forward-deployed Soviet forces (see page [ ]), and the geographical

advantages enjoyed by the Pact with consequent benefits for its reinforcement

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

capability (see pages [ ] and [ ]). These asymmetries are compounded by the

dominant presence of Soviet conventional forces which comprise two-thirds of all

active Warsaw Pact divisions in Europe west of the Urals.

216. Meanwhile, in the negotiations on Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions

(MBFR) in Vienna, dealing with conventional forces in Central Europe, NATO continues

to press the Warsaw Pact to respond positively to its 1985 proposals. In particular,

NATO had then suggested that agreement on the current size of either side&apos;s forces be

deferred while an initial reduction in US and Soviet forces was made. It remains the

case that the Warsaw Pact has neither provided adequate data on force levels nor

accepted Western proposals on verification.

CHEMICAL WEAPONS

217. The United Kingdom remains committed to a global and comprehensive ban on

the development, production and stockpiling of chemical weapons; and we continue to

play a leading and active role in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, where

negotiations on a chemical weapons convention are taking place. The negotiations have

been dominated by Western initiatives and proposals. But over the past two years there

have been welcome signs of Soviet willingness to respond more positively to Western

attempts to secure a comprehensive and global convention that is truly verifiable.

218. In particular, the response to the United Kingdom&apos;s initiative on challenge

inspection, at the Conference on Disarmament in July 1986, has been encouraging. In

August 1987, Mr Shevardnadze announced that the Soviet Union would support a

provision for mandatory challenge inspection in a chemical weapons convention, for

which the British proposals could form a basis. The United Kingdom also tabled, in July

1987, a further paper setting out some of the practical arrangements that would have to

be agreed to allow the implementation of an effective global ban.

219. Despite the progress made, a number of important and complex issues still have

to be resolved. The United Kingdom is continuing to press in Geneva for progress on a

variety of outstanding questions concerning verification, which remains the most

critical and difficult issue in the negotiations.

220. The Soviet Union has also made some useful moves towards greater openness

about its chemical warfare (CW) capabilities (see also page [ ]). It has acknowledged,

for the first time, possession of CW stocks and has claimed that stocks of chemical

weapons in the Soviet Union do not exceed 50,000 tons in terms of toxic agents. This

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

figure, however, is significantly below Western estimates of the total Soviet stockpile

and requires clarification. In October 1987, the Soviet Union invited the participants in

the Conference on Disarmament to visit its CW installation at Shikhany, reciprocating a

similar invitation to the US facility at Tooele in 1983. This was welcome, although the

visit was limited and revealed little of modern Soviet stocks and production capability.

The Soviet Union has also accepted the British invitation, made in 1986, to exchange

visits between the Chemical Defence Establishment at Porton Down and Shikhany;

planning for this is now in hand.

VERIFICATION

&apos;Verification is not the icing on the cake. It is an essential ingredient&apos;.

Sir Geoffrey Howe,

Speech to the International Institute for

Strategic Studies,

London,

January, 1987.

&apos;Foolproof ...... methods providing 100% confidence that weapons are indeed being

eliminated, that obligations relating to the remaining weapons and permitted military

activities are being complied with, and that the bans are not being circumvented - this,

and no less than this, is the verification that we envisage.&apos;

Mr Shevardnadze

Speech to the UN Conference on Disarmament,

August, 1987.

1. It is no longer necessary to make the case for verification. In principle, it is

accepted by both East and West as an essential element of any arms control agreement.

But there remains the difficult practical question of what precise measures are required

in each particular case.

2. We have come a long way since the agreements of the 1970s, which either

contained virtually no cooperative verification measures (the Biological Weapons

Convention of 1972), or relied on the mutual acceptance by the superpowers that

national technical means - essentially surveillance from space - could be used

unimpeded (the SALT Agreements). The two agreements recently signed, the

Stockholm Document of 1986 and the INF Treaty of 1987, both contain provisions for

on-site observation and inspection.

3. INF verification depends on a series of interlocking obligations and measures. The

global solution makes the task easier since, after elimination, the existence of a single

missile would be a violation. And the obligations to destroy certain visible support

structures as well as missiles, and to ban flight testing, assist the detection of

violations. The detail involved in the verification arrangements is remarkable. It

includes exchanges of data on each side&apos;s missile deployments and holdings, designation

of deployment areas, as well as on-site inspection (including inspection at short notice)

of missile bases and production plants over a period of 13 years. These arrangements

will enable each side initially to check the accuracy of data exchanged, then to monitor

the elimination of missiles and their production facilities, and, when that process is

completed, to ensure that missiles are not reintroduced. Even more remarkable are the

provisions for continuous monitoring at the perimeter of a Soviet plant assembling SS-

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

25 missiles, where there is a particular potential for circumvention. None of this

provides a guarantee that undeclared missiles could not be retained. But it reduces to

acceptable limits any risk that a militarily significant operational capability could be

preserved or created without detection.

4. Future agreements will need measures tailored to their individual circumstances.

The verification arrangements for an agreement on strategic arms reductions would

have to take into account the fact that many different types of systems would remain,

including land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (some of them mobile),

submarine-launched ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and strategic bombers.

Monitoring of residual ceilings would therefore be essential, in circumstances where the

credibility of at least some of these systems for deterrence purposes depends partly on

their concealment while deployed operationally. This would be a more demanding task

than verifying the INF Treaty. The verification framework that has already been

agreed in the strategic arms negotiations acknowledges the need for continuous

monitoring of the perimeter of critical production and support facilities, for short-

notice inspection of suspect sites not otherwise declared, and for open displays of

treaty-limited items at bases and ports at times chosen by the other side. The

evolution of this framework into precise measures, which balance the requirements of

verification, operational flexibility and national security, will be a complex and

difficult matter.

5. NATO&apos;s other immediate arms control priorities, in respect of conventional and

chemical weapons, arguably face even greater verification problems. In the MBFR

negotiations on conventional forces NATO has proposed a package of detailed measures

designed to provide confidence both that initial troop reductions had occurred, and,

more important, that consequent force levels were not exceeded. The measures include

permanent entry and exit points through which all troops would pass, provision of

detailed information on residual forces, and 30 inspections a year, in order to monitor

force levels of a million men in more than 2,000 camps and barracks spread over some

200,000 square miles of Central Europe. So far the Warsaw Pact has not accepted these

proposals, which it claims are disproportionate to the obligations incurred. But, in the

West&apos;s view, considerably more complex arrangements would be required for any

agreement - such as that envisaged in the proposed new conventional stability talks (see

paragraphs 212-215) - that dealt with the whole of Europe from the Atlantic to Urals.

6. A ban on chemical weapons would introduce two further complications: global

coverage, and the continued need for civil industry to use relevant chemicals. The

United Kingdom has taken the initiative in the Conference on Disarmament, where we

have made proposals for challenge inspection and for an international system to monitor

compliance, including compliance by industry. There is a difficult balance to be struck

between reasonable assurance of compliance, deterrence from cheating, practicality of

implementation, confidentiality of commercial information and protection of national

security.

7. The main complication in verifying a Comprehensive Test Ban would be the

difficulty of distinguishing low-level, but militarily significant, nuclear tests from

natural phenomena and conventional explosions. There is also a danger that nuclear

explosions could be hidden from detection by masking techniques. A step-by-step

approach to this issue (see paragraphs 209-210) would help to overcome these

difficulties.

8. The West has led the way in the search for practical and effective verification

measures, proposing new ideas, like designated deployment areas and perimeter

monitoring. The manner in which these, and other aspects of the INF verification

arrangements, are implemented will influence the evolution of the more complex

arrangements needed in future agreements. The details will remain all important: if

they are wrong, the benefits of arms control agreements can disappear in unresolved

accusations and suspicions of non-compliance and deceit.

AIMS FOR THE FUTURE

221. When NATO Ministers reviewed their arms control aims at Reykjavik in June last

year, they agreed that the prospective INF agreement would be an important element in

a coherent and comprehensive concept of arms control and disarmament, which, while

consistent with NATO&apos;s strategy of flexible response, would include:

a 50% reduction in the strategic offensive nuclear weapons of the United

States and the Soviet Union, to be achieved during the current Geneva

negotiations;

the global elimination of chemical weapons; and

the establishment of a stable and secure level of conventional forces, by

the elimination of disparities, in the whole of Europe.

They also concluded that, in conjunction with the establishment of a conventional

balance and the global elimination of chemical weapons, tangible and verifiable

reductions of US and Soviet land-based nuclear missile systems of shorter range, leading

to equal ceilings, could be considered. These aims were reaffirmed by the NATO

summit meeting in March, which recognised the urgency and central importance of

addressing the conventional force imbalances in Europe.

222. Although the INF Agreement is a major achievement, it will not obviate the

need for effective deterrence. Chapter 1 explains why nuclear weapons will still be

needed for that purpose. Last year&apos;s Statement described the important contribution

made by the British independent deterrent to the effectiveness and credibility of the

Alliance&apos;s deterrence strategy; it also explained that the British strategic nuclear force,

even when updated by the acquisition of Trident, represents the minimum capability

necessary to maintain effective deterrence into the next century. The United

Kingdom&apos;s position on the role of our own nuclear deterrent in strategic negotiations

remains that, if Soviet and US strategic arsenals were to be very substantially reduced

and if no significant changes had occurred in Soviet defensive capabilities, we would

want to consider how we could best contribute to arms control in the light of the

reduced threat. But US and Soviet reductions would have to go much further than 50%

before we could consider including the British deterrent in arms control negotiations:

even after such a reduction and the introduction of Trident, the British deterrent would

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

still represent a smaller proportion of Soviet strategic offensive warheads than did

Polaris when it entered full operational service in 1970.

223. The priority in strategic arms negotiations, as both NATO and the Soviet Union

accept, must thus be reductions in US and Soviet arsenals, which are far greater than

the forces of the other nuclear weapon states - amounting to some 95% of the world-

wide total. A 50% reduction, removing many thousands of nuclear warheads, would not

undermine either NATO or Soviet strategies, but would, through its political effect,

significantly enhance stability. It will not be possible, however, to move towards

greater stability in Europe while the significant Warsaw Pact superiorities in

conventional and chemical forces remain. The United Kingdom therefore believes that

there should be no negotiations about further reductions of nuclear weapons in Europe

until the imbalance of conventional forces in Europe has been redressed and a ban on

chemical weapons achieved.

224. NATO&apos;s future arms control aims thus address the continuing security needs of

Europe, while offering realistic prospects for successful negotiation of agreements. As

has been shown, significant progress has already been made. The close relationship

between the arms control process and other aspects of security policy was recognised

by Ministers at their Reykjavik meeting, when they commissioned work in NATO to

develop a comprehensive concept of arms control and disarmament. This is now

proceeding.

ESSAY

THE FORWARD DEFENCE OF EUROPE

1. When the Atlantic Alliance was formed in 1949, it was recognised that the forces

kept by the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe since the end of the Second World War posed

the greatest threat to the freedom of the West. This threat has required NATO to

maintain large ground and air forces of its own in the Federal Republic of Germany.

But this of itself has never been enough. Any successful defence of Europe would be

linked to the success of operations in the Norwegian Sea, in North Norway and the

Baltic Approaches, and on the Southern Flank. This essay, therefore, looks at how the

threat from the Warsaw Pact would be countered forward in the European arena as a

whole.

2. NATO&apos;s strategy of forward defence dates formally from a meeting of the North

Atlantic Council in New York in 1950. The determination expressed then to resist any

attack on Alliance territory as far to the East as possible derives logically from the

commitment made by the signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty to defend all the

territory of the Alliance. The consequences of doing otherwise were described by the

Federal German Minister of Defence, Herr von Hassel, in 1963:

&apos;To regard the Federal Republic, or even a large part of Western Europe, solely as

a battlefield, which NATO forces would have to liberate afterwards, would

forecast the total destruction of Western Europe. This appears to me hardly a

valid objective of defence policy&apos;.

3. Initially, the forces deployed for this purpose were those of the Western occupying

powers: the United States, Britain and France. But the modified Brussels Treaty and

Paris Agreements of 1954 opened the way for the admission of the Federal Republic to

membership of the Alliance and for the stationing of troops from other NATO countries

on its soil. The exact size and composition of Alliance forces have varied over the

years, but the commitment to forward defence has remained. As the Alliance made the

transition from the so-called tripwire strategy of massive nuclear retaliation to the

strategy of flexible response in the 1960s, the contribution of forward-deployed forces

to deterrence increased in importance. Their contribution remains vital today.

4. Forward defence is not an aggressive strategy: Alliance leaders have consistently

said that NATO forces will never be used except in response to an attack. Nor indeed

do NATO forces have the capability to mount an offensive to seize Eastern Europe.

The aim of the Alliance is to maintain sufficient forces, both in place and as

1

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

reinforcements, to contribute to deterrence by demonstrating its determination to

resist aggression. If deterrence should fail, the aim would be to compel the Warsaw

Pact to reinforce its own in-place forces before mounting an attack; this would provide

early warning of Pact intentions, enabling NATO to reinforce to its full strength and

providing a breathing space in which efforts could be made to defuse the crisis. If an

attack with conventional forces took place, NATO&apos;s aim would be to defend Alliance

territory for as long as possible without recourse to nuclear weapons.

5.     There are three interrelated elements to the forward defence of Europe:

On the Central Front, the requirement is to counter any aggression across

the Inner German Border (IGB). The Federal Republic has 30% of its

population and 25% of its industrial capacity located within 100km of the

IGB. This fact alone might be sufficient to justify defending forward. But

the Alliance also has little scope to concede territory for military reasons.

The absence of France from NATO&apos;s integrated military structure means

that all Western forces on the Central Front, with their associated airfields,

ammunition dumps, support and other facilities, are located in a narrow

corridor 250km-350km wide, consisting of the Federal Republic and the

Benelux countries. There are also tactical advantages to be gained from

such a strategy; the terrain close to the IGB contains marshes, canals, rivers

and urban sprawl, all of which favour the defender.

Forward deployment of NATO&apos;s maritime power is an integral part of the

strategy, and British maritime forces play a particularly valuable role. The

conventional defence of Europe depends on safeguarding trans-Atlantic and

cross-Channel lines of communication, which are vital to the reinforcement

of Europe. The Soviet threat would come especially from submarines

capable both of disrupting our shipping and, in the case of those armed with

cruise missiles, of launching conventional or nuclear attacks on land targets.

In the event of conflict, containment of these forces as far to the north as

possible would be the most effective way of reducing the threat in the

greater expanse of the Atlantic Ocean; and would help to safeguard the

United Kingdom and the countries of the Northern Region.

On NATO&apos;s flanks, the security of Alliance countries depends on the

reinforcements required for their defence arriving in time. Britain&apos;s main

contribution is in the Northern Region where, as well as our forward

maritime role, British amphibious, land and air reinforcements must deter

2

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

aggression and help our allies hold the ring until the arrival of major US

forces. Any alternative strategy would leave Norway, Denmark and Iceland

at risk. It would also increase the threat, via the Baltic Approaches, to the

Central Front and the United Kingdom. While British forces make a smaller

contribution in the Southern Region, a similar Alliance commitment there is

equally important to the integrity of NATO&apos;s defence, and is an

indispensable element in the cohesion of the Alliance.

The British forces that contribute to forward defence are set out in paragraph 302. The

disposition of NATO forces on the Central Front is described [below].

6. Forward defence does not necessarily imply a static defence. At sea and in the

air this is self-evident, but it is equally true on land. In order to take advantage of

force improvements, such as recent developments in anti-armour capability, Northern

Army Group (NORTHAG) has adopted a more mobile operational concept that

acknowledges the possibility of initially having to yield ground. Reconnaissance forces

would identify the main axes of attack and a quick-reacting covering force would, if

necessary, delay the enemy to allow the main forces to prepare defensive positions.

Ground defence forces, supported by air forces, would then exploit obstacles and

minefield barriers to break up and reduce invading forces, while mobile reserves

(including air-mobile forces - see page [ ]) would attack the flanks and the rear of

enemy spearheads.

7. While NATO ground forces would seek to defeat the first wave of Soviet troops,

NATO air forces have several roles, including defence against Soviet air power, air

support involving short-range attacks on Soviet ground forces, and interdiction of

follow-on forces. The Alliance is now updating its land/air concept for Follow-On

Forces Attack. This is intended to delay the movement and arrival of enemy second

echelon forces and to disrupt the timing and coordination of combined operations, thus

relieving the pressure on NATO ground forces. In all this, the inherent flexibility, reach

and rapid reaction of air power would be crucial.

8. The chief problems that face NATO in carrying out this strategy are the

numerical superiority of the Warsaw Pact forces in the area, and NATO&apos;s reliance on

reinforcement to bring its own forces up to full strength. Reinforcement is essential

because an unacceptable burden would be placed on the Federal Republic and other

contributing nations if forces were stationed at full battle strength on the Central

Front in peacetime. But such a strategy carries risks. The problem is most severe for

3

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

North American and British reinforcements, which involve movement by sea of large

quantities of men and materiel. But Dutch and Belgian reinforcements would have to

travel up to 200 km and, of NATO forces actually in the Federal Republic, fewer than

25% are based within 50 km of their intended defensive positions. The Warsaw Pact, by

contrast, can reinforce its own forces relatively easily (see page [ ]).

9. Nevertheless, provision of forward-deployed NATO forces of sufficient strength,

readiness and capability provides an essential component of flexible response, and helps

avoid undue reliance on early use of nuclear weapons. Forward-deployed forces also

give a clear signal to the Soviet Union that aggression will instantly involve the forces

not just of the Federal Republic but also of the United States and other allies. As long

as US forces contribute to forward defence in Europe, the Soviet Union can be in no

doubt that any attack would involve a superpower confrontation, with all the

incalculable risks of escalation to a nuclear exchange that this would entail.

NATO FORCES ON THE CENTRAL FRONT

[Figure 3]

1. The British contribution on the Central Front, 1 BR Corps and RAF(Germany), is

described in paragraph 302. With a peacetime strength of some 55,000 Army and 12,000

RAF personnel it is larger than the contribution of any of our continental allies except

the Federal Republic. The US presence is some 250,000 strong, Belgium&apos;s 29,000, the

Netherlands&apos; 8,000, Canada&apos;s 6,000 and that of the Federal Republic itself, 495,000.

Although France does not participate in NATO&apos;s military structure, it stations 50,000

troops in the Federal Republic under the terms of the modified Brussels Treaty of 1954.

In time of crisis or tension all these in-place forces would be substantially reinforced

(see page [   ] ). On mobilisation, the size of the British forces would be nearly trebled.

2. All these forces generally remain under national control in peacetime and, with

the exception of the French, are transferred to NATO under the command of SACEUR

in time of tension or war. The map shows how they are distributed. The Central Front

is divided into two Army Groups (NORTHAG, commanded by a British officer, and

CENTAG), each of which is sub-divided into four sectors. Each sector is the

responsibility of a national corps (a group of two to four divisions comprising 35-90,000

men before reinforcement). Looking from north to south in NORTHAG there are

Dutch, Federal German, British and Belgian corps; and in CENTAG there are a Federal

German, two American and a further Federal German corps. French and Canadian

forces are held further back in the south, and an American brigade (the forward-

positioned part of a US Corps normally based in the United States) is similarly placed in

the north. The allied air forces are divided into two tactical air forces (2 ATAF in the

north commanded by a British officer, and 4 ATAF in the south) under the overall

command of COMAAFCE (Commander Allied Air Forces Central Europe).

CHAPTER THREE: THE ARMED FORCES

301. This chapter sets out the contribution made by the armed forces to each of our

main defence roles during the year. It reports on the progress of the Services&apos;

equipment plans and on their other activities, including those outside the NATO area

and their involvement with the civilian community. In addition, it takes a more

detailed look at topical aspects of each of the three Services&apos; tasks.

BRITAIN&apos;S MAIN DEFENCE ROLES

302. The great majority of our forces are committed to carrying out our four main

roles in NATO:

Nuclear Forces. Since 1969, Britain&apos;s strategic force of last resort has

been the Royal Navy&apos;s Polaris submarines, at least one of which is on

patrol at all times. These vessels will be replaced by Trident missile-

carrying submarines in the mid-1990s (see page [ ]). Our theatre

nuclear-capable forces comprise nine RAF strike-attack squadrons of

Tornado GR1 and two of Buccaneer, based in the United Kingdom and the

Federal Republic of Germany, which can conduct nuclear operations with

British free-fall bombs as well as fulfilling their conventional role; the

Royal Navy&apos;s Sea Harrier aircraft and ship-borne anti-submarine

helicopters, which, together with RAF Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft,

are able to deliver both conventional and nuclear weapons, including US

nuclear depth bombs; and one regiment of Lance surface-to-surface

missiles and four regiments of artillery operated by the Army in the

Federal Republic and capable of firing nuclear warheads supplied by the

United States.

Defence of the United Kingdom. The direct defence of these islands

involves all three Services. The RAF, assisted by the Royal Navy, is

responsible for the air defence of the United Kingdom and the surrounding

seas (see page [ ]). The Royal Navy and the RAF help to keep open our re-

supply routes across the Atlantic, and the mine countermeasures vessels

of the Royal Navy and the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) combat the threat

posed to our ports and coastal waters by mines (see [below] ). On the

ground, the task of protecting vital military bases and installations falls

mainly to the Army and the RAF. Over 100,000 ground forces are

available for the defence of the United Kingdom, including the Home

CONFIDENTIAL



CONFIDENTIAL

Service Force (HSF), the Royal Auxiliary Air Force (R Aux AF) Regiment

and elements of the Territorial Army (TA), as well as elements of the

Royal Navy and Royal Marines-

Defence of the European Mainland.  We station ground and air forces on

the Continent as our contribution to the forward defence of NATO and in

fulfilment of our commitments under the modified Brussels Treaty; and

we keep forces ready to reinforce the flanks in times of tension (see

page [   ] ). The British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), based in the Federal

Republic, is the main component of our forces on the Continent. It

consists of I(BR) Corps, which forms part of NORTH AG, and is responsible

for the defence of a 65km stretch of front.   The Corps comprises three

divisions, which include armour, infantry, artillery and air defence units.

Other ground forces, based in the United Kingdom but ready for rapid

deployment to reinforce NATO&apos;s flanks, include the British contingent of

the United Kingdom and Netherlands Amphibious Force and the United

Kingdom Mobile Force (UKMF) for use in the Northern Region, and a

contribution to the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force (AMF), which

could deploy to either the northern or southern flank; the RAF&apos;s transport

force contributes to this capability.    RAF Germany consists of 15

squadrons of aircraft, and forms part of 2 ATAF. Its main role would be

to carry out long-range attacks against enemy airfields and lines of

communication; and RAF squadrons would provide air defence, tactical

reconnaissance, close air support for the Army, and logistics and tactical

air transport.  We also maintain forces, not assigned to NATO, in Berlin

and Gibraltar.

Maritime Forces in the Eastern Atlantic and Channel areas. Our forces -

ships, submarines and aircraft of the Royal Navy, and aircraft of the RAF

- make a significant contribution to forward defence in the Norwegian Sea

(see page [ ]), and to maritime operations in the Atlantic and shallow

seas, where they would be primarily concerned to protect the deployment

of our strategic deterrent and ensure the safe arrival of reinforcement

and resupply shipping. The United Kingdom has the largest navy of any

European NATO country and contributes some 70% of the ships available

in these areas with the ability to deploy early at a time of tension or war.

303. We have described in detail in previous Statements how the Services carry out

these roles.   Their ability to do so is maintained by constant training and a full

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

programme of exercises, both national and Alliance-wide. In the last year, WINTEX-

CIMEX, held in March 1987, was the most wide-ranging of these exercises. It is a

biennial command post (or paper) exercise designed to practise NATO&apos;s command and

control procedures and to test the effectiveness of national crisis management

organisations in times of increasing international tension or war. In the United

Kingdom, our participation extended down to District Headquarters level.

MINE COUNTER-MEASURES IN HOME WATERS

[Figure 5]

1. One of the more serious threats to shipping around our ports and anchorages in

wartime would come from the modern sea mine, which, if not countered, could affect

the deployment of our Polaris submarines and endanger the safety of shipping carrying

vital reinforcements and supplies.

2. Today&apos;s mines come in several forms. The influence mine is equipped with sensor

mechanisms designed to detect such characteristics as the underwater acoustic,

magnetic or pressure signatures (either singly or in combination) of potential ship

targets. The contact mine is designed to explode when it touches a ship&apos;s hull. Mines

can also be designed to lie on the sea bed (ground mines) or at a predetermined depth,

tethered by a wire to the sea bed (moored mines). Variants exist that can propel

themselves upwards to explode under passing vessels.

3. The Royal Navy deals with the mining threat either by hunting or by sweeping; the

choice depends on the type of mine expected. Minehunters (the Hunt or new Sandown

class vessels) are equipped with high definition underwater acoustic search equipment,

which generates an electronic image of the sea bed, including objects lying proud of it.

Once a mine-like object has been detected, it is identified using a remote-controlled

vehicle launched from the minehunter. This process can deal with all mines and does

not rely on knowing how any individual mine is designed to work. The mines can either

be destroyed or, in some cases, recovered for examination.

4. Minesweepers (the Hunt again or River class) can destroy mines either by

influence or mechanical sweeps. The influence minesweeper uses equipment, normally

towed, which generates underwater acoustic or magnetic signals (singly or in

combination) that mimic those of a ship and deceive influence mines into exploding.

Mechanical minesweepers are equipped with specially designed steel wires, which are

towed through the water, astern and either side of the vessel, to sever the tethering

wire of moored mines. The mine either then explodes or can be destroyed when it rises

to the surface.

5. The RNR makes an important contribution to our mine countermeasures

capability, manning 11 of the 12 River class minesweepers in the Fleet. These low-cost

vessels are specially designed for minesweeping in deeper waters. The RNR also

provides crews for other vessels, such as trawlers, that in wartime would be taken up

from trade for mine countermeasures purposes.

CONFIDENTIAL



CONFIDENTIAL

304. The defence of the United Kingdom involves the Services in regular training for

their tasks. In addition, in 1987 the Royal Navy tested its mine countermeasures

capability in several exercises with NATO partners. The Army reviewed plans during

WINTEX-CIMEX for the mobilization and deployment of Regular, TA andHSF troops, in

preparation for a series of exercises to be held in Autumn 1988 to test current plans.

Studies were also carried out into the use of helicopters, command and control, and

logistics in support of military home defence operations. All aspects of our air defence

system are exercised regularly; in April 1988, for example, some 1,200 sorties were

flown by other NATO aircraft, testing our air defences during the nationwide exercise

ELDER FOREST. On average RAF fighters scramble three or four times each week to

intercept and identify aircraft entering the United Kingdom Air Defence Region

(UKADR).

AIR DEFENCE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM

[Figure 6]

1. The strategic position of the British Isles ensures that, in the event of a major

conflict between East and West, we would be a prime target for attack. The

destruction of our air defence assets, including aircraft, airfields and radar sites, would

be among the enemy&apos;s first priorities as he sought to gain air superiority. Responsibility

for the air defence of the United Kingdom rests with RAF Strike Command, which

maintains a constant radar watch over the air and sea approaches to the United

Kingdom, and holds aircraft on ground alert at all times ready to scramble and

intercept unwelcome intruders into the UKADR. In time of tension or war, continuous

combat air patrols would be flown. Royal Navy ships with an air defence capability also

contribute to our defences.

2. In the event of conflict, NATO&apos;s own offensive operations could be expected to

reduce the enemy&apos;s ability to attack the United Kingdom by destroying his airfields and

aircraft on the ground. But a substantial threat would remain from long-range bombers,

some equipped with stand-off weapons. To deal with this, the RAF has developed the

sophisticated system of layered defences illustrated above. The first line of defence

aims to detect and intercept hostile aircraft entering NATO airspace, destroying them

before they approach their targets. In order to deploy these defences swiftly and

effectively, a comprehensive NATO-wide command, control and communications

system is vital. As part of this a new system, known as the improved United Kingdom

Air Defence Ground Environment, will soon be operational, receiving information from

a new generation of transportable radars; and airborne early warning will be much

improved from 1991 onwards as the seven Boeing E-3s on order enter service.

3. The responsibility for initial engagement of enemy aircraft would lie with the

Tornado F3, armed with Skyflash medium-range and Sidewinder short-range air-to-air

missiles. Two squadrons have been formed during the last year, and all seven squadrons

will have entered service by the early 1990s. Supporting the Tornados would be two

squadrons of Phantoms armed with Skyflash and Sidewinder and an inner shield of Hawk

aircraft equipped with Sidewinder. Air-to-air refuelling would enable most of our

fighters to remain longer on patrol and operate further from their bases.

4. Enemy aircraft that penetrated the outer defensive screen would additionally face

attack by Bloodhound surface-to-air medium-range missiles; if they still survived they

CONFIDENTIAL


jpig 6 - Air Defence of the United Kingdom


CONFIDENTIAL

would be engaged by the shorter-range Rapier missiles and radar-directed Oerlikon guns

that protect our most important airfields. In addition, passive measures, such as

placing aircraft on the ground in hardened shelters and dispersing key assets, would help

to reduce the damage inflicted. On the ground, defence of our air bases from terrorists

or enemy special forces would be provided by RAF Regular personnel and six squadrons

of the R Aux AF Regiment.

305. The defence of the European mainland requires an intensive annual programme

to test Alliance forces both in their operational roles and in the complex task of

reinforcement from the home base. The major exercise of the year was REFORGER in

Autumn 1987, in which troops of the III (US) Corps deployed from the United States to

the Central Region and subsequently, in Exercise CERTAIN STRIKE, practised plans

and procedures for operations in the NORTHAG area; the United Kingdom&apos;s 4th

Armoured Brigade and other troops from 1(BR) Corps also participated. In October

1987, the United Kingdom-based 2nd Infantry Division, comprising 19,000 personnel

including TA elements, was deployed by RAF transport aircraft and by sea for Exercise

KEYSTONE. Once in theatre, the deployed forces joined elements from 1(BR) Corps

and troops from the Federal Republic and Belgium to undertake combined defence and

counter-attack operations against air-landed and mechanised forces. The main part of

the exercise involved over 32,000 troops and, under the terms of the Stockholm

Document (see paragraph 211), was witnessed by 39 observers from 17 signatory

countries. The training that the RAF carries out for its operational role on the Central

Front is described on page [ ]. In October 1987, air defence Phantoms from RAF

Germany took part in exercise RED FLAG in Nevada for the first time; the excellent

training available in this exercise closely resembles possible Central Front scenarios.

Between January and March 1988, both the United Kingdom and Netherlands

Amphibious Force and the British forces that form part of the AMF carried out annual

arctic warfare training in Norway.

AIR MOBILITY

[Figure 7]

1. Warsaw Pact military doctrine (see page [ ]) relies on the concentration of

massive force to overwhelm defending forces and achieve a breakthrough. To counter

this threat, NORTHAG devised its concept of flexible operations (see page [ ]). A key

element of this is the ability to counter enemy forces, particularly their armoured

formations, should they penetrate NATO&apos;s front line, using mobile reserves with a

powerful anti-tank capability.

2. Helicopter-borne forces are ideal for this purpose. The axis of an enemy advance

would not be known until very shortly before his attack began. Until then the

defending forces would be faced with several possible lines of attack; and the task of

CONFIDENTIAL



CONFIDENTIAL

identifying the main axis of advance would be made more difficult by the enemy&apos;s use

of feints and deception to disguise his intentions. To be effective, allied armoured

reserves would have to be committed early to the battle, possibly before the enemy&apos;s

intention was clear, whereas air-mobile forces could be held back and moved swiftly

into position when required.

3. In 1984, 6 Brigade of 1(BR) Corps, based at Soest, was tasked with conducting

trials of a doctrine for air-mobile operations in close cooperation with the RAF. The

doctrine, as developed, involved the use of RAF Puma and Chinook helicopters to move

men and equipment into concealed positions behind the NATO front line at the point

where an imminent enemy breakthrough had been identified. The infantry would be

armed with Milan - the Army&apos;s medium-range man-portable anti-tank system. They

would be supported by Lynx helicopters of the Army Air Corps, armed with TOW - the

longer-range wire-guided anti-tank missile. The considerable anti-tank power of these

combined forces would be brought to bear on the enemy as he breached the allied front

line. Their aim would be to disrupt and halt the advance of his armour, allowing time

for allied armour to move in and complete the destruction of enemy formations or

compel him to retreat.

4. The success of this trial over the past four years has produced a doctrine for air-

mobile operations, and identified procedures and equipment, which will allow these

operations to be developed into the next century.

5. This year, 24 Brigade will begin conversion to the air-mobile role in place of 6

Brigade; it will include an Army Air Corps regiment equipped with both anti-tank and

utility Lynx helicopters supported by the RAF&apos;s troop-carrying and heavy-lift

helicopters. The EH 101 is intended to succeed the Puma in these roles in the 1990s.

306. Our maritime forces have also maintained a high level of activity. In August

and September 1987, the Royal Navy contributed 20 warships and Royal Fleet

Auxiliaries to OCEAN SAFARI, one of an annual series of NATO maritime exercises in

the north and mid-Atlantic. RAF Phantoms were deployed to the forward operating

base at RAF Stornoway, and Buccaneer and Canberra aircraft undertook maritime

operations, supported by VC10 and Tristar tankers. In all, over 150 ships and 250

aircraft took part from 11 countries. The main purpose of the exercise was to practise

the protection of reinforcement and convoy shipping. This involved the assembly and

escort of four convoys from the Canary Islands to the south coast of England; forward

anti-submarine warfare (ASW) defence was also practised in the Norwegian Sea. Apart

from such set-piece exercises, every ship and submarine of the Royal Navy, when new

or emerging from refit, undergoes a rigorous period of training at Portland or on the

Clyde before undertaking operational duties; and, once operational, vessels periodically

return for shorter periods of such training to ensure that they remain as effective as

possible. Other NATO nations also regularly carry out sea training at Portland, and

take part in joint Royal Navy and RAF maritime exercises around the British Isles. The

Royal Navy continues to maintain its commitment to the Standing Naval Force

Atlantic, Standing Naval Force Channel and Naval On-Call Force Mediterranean. The

CONFIDENTIAL



CONFIDENTIAL

RAF again demonstrated its excellence in ASW by winning, for the second successive

year, the Fincastle Competition held between maritime patrol squadrons from

Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand.

307. The programme for the remainder of 1988 sees this pattern continuing and units

from all three Services will participate in land, sea and air exercises in the NATO area.

In May, for instance, RAF Nimrods and a Commando Group of the Royal Marines (the

latter embarked in two Landing Ships Logistic (LSL) and HMS Intrepid) will take part in

the amphibious phase of exercise DRAGON HAMMER in the western Mediterranean.

And in September, units from the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and the RAF will join

forces from nine other NATO nations in the major maritime and amphibious exercise,

TEAMWORK 88, in the eastern Atlantic and the Norwegian Sea; the UKMF with RAF

support will take part in Exercise BOLD GROUSE in the Zealand area of Denmark; and

British elements of the AMF will deploy to Turkey for Exercise ALLY EXPRESS. In the

United Kingdom, there will be a number of individual regional Military Home Defence

exercises in the Autumn.

THE ROYAL NAVY

308. The Navy&apos;s current strength is described at Annex A, and recent additions to its

equipment programme are set out in Table 1. Progress in the Trident programme is

described on page [ ].

309. The programme to modernise our conventional naval forces is proceeding well.

The final three Trafalgar class nuclear-powered Fleet submarines are being built or

undergoing trials (including HMS Trenchant, scheduled to enter service later this year),

as are the first four of the new Upholder class conventionally-powered patrol

submarines. The first of the latter class, HMS Upholder, is to enter service in this

financial year. The Government remains committed to maintaining an escort force of

about 50 frigates and destroyers: we have invited tenders for up to four more Type 23

frigates in addition to the four already on order, and work continues on the four Type 22

frigates currently being built. Orders were placed last summer for the next four

Sandown class single-role minehunters as part of the continuing modernisation of our

mine countermeasures capability, which has seen 25 vessels ordered since 1979.

310. Contracts were also placed last summer for feasibility studies into the option of

replacing the assault ships Fearless and Intrepid with new ships, thus maintaining our

amphibious capability in the longer term. We shall assess the results of these studies,

along with the completed study on the ship-life extension option, in good time to decide

what to do when Fearless and Intrepid reach the end of their current useful lives in the

mid-1990s. The purpose-built LSL, RFA Sir Galahad, whose predecessor was lost in the

Falklands campaign, joined the Fleet last November and immediately participated in

her first beach landing in Exercise PURPLE WARRIOR (see page [ ]). The air-training

ship Argus should complete her trials and enter operational service later this year.

Construction of the first Auxiliary Oiler Replenishment vessel has started and an order

was placed for the second last December. Stocks of fuel, spares, stores and most

weapons and types of ammunition meet NATO requirements in full; and, for example

where new weapons have been brought into service or requirements have been

increased, plans exist to eliminate shortfalls.

THE ARMY

311. The Army&apos;s current strength is given at Annex B. Details of its equipment

programme over the last year are in Table 2.

312. New equipment for the Army continues to enter service. In the last year BAOR

received its fifth regiment of Challenger tanks, and the first battalion&apos;s-worth of the

new Warrior mechanised infantry combat vehicle. Three further battalions&apos;-worth of

the Saxon armoured personnel carrier have also been delivered. From April 1988, 24

Brigade began to take over the air-mobile role from 6 Brigade (see page [ ]), which will

revert to a mechanised role and will consist of an additional Challenger-equipped

armoured regiment and two infantry battalions mounted in Warrior. The introduction of

the new SA 80 infantry weapons, the S10 respirator and battlefield thermal-imaging

equipment continues and the new LAW 80 man-portable anti-tank weapon is entering

service this year. Looking further ahead a third air defence missile regiment is to be

formed, equipped with the new Starstreak high velocity missile (HVM) system, while

existing towed Rapier fire-units will be replaced with the advanced Rapier 2000. Other

major new equipment under order for deployment in the next few years includes the

Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), the Phoenix remotely-piloted air vehicle, and

the new Challenger armoured repair and recovery vehicle.

313. This new equipment represents a major advance in the Army&apos;s operational

capabilities. It will increase the mobility and firepower of the infantry and mechanised

units, improve the Royal Artillery&apos;s indirect fire capability, and provide protection

against a wide range of chemical and conventional threats from the air. In addition, the

Army devotes substantial resources to ensuring adequate supplies of war materiel,

including fuel, ammunition and spares, for sustained combat.

THE RAF

314. The RAF&apos;s major equipment modernisation programme continues (see Table 3).

Its current strength is shown in Annex C.

315. In the last year, we have ordered an additional Boeing E-3 airborne early

warning aircraft to supplement the six ordered previously. This will provide the RAF

with a robust capability to mount continuous airborne early-warning patrols. We have

also recently placed a production contract for 34 more Harrier GR5 aircraft - in

addition to the 62 already on order - to sustain the force into the 1990s. Although there

have been some delays as a result of the loss of an aircraft in October 1987 and

technical difficulties, the first squadron should form later this year, representing a

substantial improvement over the existing GR3. A programme for the provision of a

night and poor weather capability is also under way.

316. The first two squadrons of Tornado F3, equipped with Foxhunter radar to an

agreed interim standard, formed during the year and are already providing a capability

superior to that of the aircraft they replace. A revised fixed-price contract has now

been agreed with the contractor to bring the radar up to the required standard. In

addition, 2729 (City of Lincoln) Squadron of the R Aux AF Regiment, equipped with ex-

Argentinian Oerlikon guns directed by all-weather Skyguard radars, has been declared

operational. Two Tucano aircraft, the new basic trainer for the RAF, have been

delivered for trials. The ability of our front-line airfields in RAF Germany to continue

to operate during wartime will be considerably enhanced with the redeployment from

the United Kingdom of a squadron of Royal Engineers for airfield damage repair in

1989.

317. We have placed an order for the Boxer 2 communications bearer system, which

will provide a nation-wide secure and survivable communications system using new

fibre-optic technology. We have also reached agreement with the prime contractor on

how to proceed with ALARM, the advanced anti-radar missile to be carried by Tornado

GR1 aircraft. The prime contractor is satisfied with the initial performance of the new

rocket motor and the programme will now proceed to completion. The RAF already

meets NATO requirements for virtually all warstocks and has plans to remove

remaining shortfalls.

FLIGHT SAFETY

31S. Each year, the RAF flies sorties all over the world in many different types of

aircraft, including Hercules, VC10 transports, Puma helicopters and Tornado fast jets.

Flights range from low-level fast-jet training and search and rescue operations to troop

and logistic transport. Despite operating in an increasingly demanding environment, the

RAF&apos;s flight safety record has improved steadily. Since 1981 the accident rate has been

almost halved, and in 1987 it was the lowest in the Service&apos;s history, there being fewer

than one major accident for every 35,000 hours flown (see Volume 2 Table 5.8).

THE MERCHANT FLEET

319. The Government is continuing to monitor the number of merchant vessels on

the United Kingdom and dependent territory registers that are available to meet the

needs of the armed forces in wartime. Despite the recent decline, numbers are still

sufficient for these needs. NATO has agreed to our proposal for a study of the

Alliance&apos;s ability to meet its needs in time of emergency and war; this is expected to

start shortly.

320. Last year&apos;s Statement described the steps being taken to ensure the availability

of crews for vessels requisitioned in an emergency. For this purpose, the Merchant

Shipping Bill, introduced last October, contained provisions enabling the Government

both to provide financial assistance for the training and travel costs of British merchant

seamen and to establish a Merchant Navy Reserve.

LOW-FLYING TRAINING

1. For deterrence to be effective, our aircraft have to be capable of retaliating

against targets deep inside enemy territory, penetrating sophisticated and integrated

enemy radar and defensive systems. For the present, the best way of avoiding both

detection and interception is to fly as close to the ground and as fast as possible, using

the terrain to mask our aircraft from enemy radar.

2. The techniques of low flying over land, however, demand great skill, which can

only be acquired by long and careful training, and maintained by constant practice. The

acquisition of this skill cannot be left until it is needed operationally. The need for

low-flying training has, therefore, been recognised as a vital part of RAF operational

doctrine for 25 years or more and is expected to continue into the foreseeable future.

Although there has been some increase in this training in recent years, largely as a

result of the introduction of the Tornado GR1 aircraft, we expect the level of activity

to remain fairly constant from now on.


CONFIDENTIAL

3. We take great care, however, to limit the nuisance to the public caused by low-

flying aircraft, and we shall continue to do so.

4. In war, aircraft would fly as fast and as low as possible - in the Falklands conflict

aircraft often needed to fly below 100 ft and at speeds of over 600 mph. But most low-

flying training in this country is restricted to 450 mph and above 250 ft. Training at

lower altitudes is mainly undertaken in virtually unpopulated parts of the United States

and Canada, where we practise down to a level of 100 ft, and participate in exercises

which involve flying below 250 ft. Only a very little such flying, mainly essential work-

up training for these exercises, is carried out in the United Kingdom in three sparsely

populated areas in northern Scotland, the Scottish Borders and central Wales.

5. Unfortunately, it is not possible to reduce low-flying training in this country

below its current level without damaging the RAF&apos;s operational capability. There is

also a limit to how much can be done abroad, not only because that is expensive and

wasteful of pilot training time in transit, but also because there is no substitute for

training in Europe over the sort of terrain the aircrews would encounter in the event of

conflict.

NORTHERN IRELAND

321. The security policy in Northern Ireland, which has been followed by successive

Governments, is to fight terrorism with all appropriate resources under the rule of law.

The Government is determined to pursue its efforts to restore peace and order in the

Province. In the past year terrorist violence has continued; the IRA&apos;s Remembrance

Sunday bombing at Enniskillen, and the scale of recent arms finds on both sides of the

border, underline the nature of the continued terrorist threat. The Army is deployed in

Northern Ireland to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in combating that

threat; and this remains the Service&apos;s most important national peace-time operational

commitment.

322. The Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) now has responsibility for the military

element of security in 85% of Northern Ireland. It has nevertheless been necessary to

retain ten major units in the infantry role in the Province; their wide range of activities

in support of the RUC includes patrolling, manning vehicle check points and guarding

buildings. Following a review of the deployment of the security forces in the Province,

the Government announced, in January 1988, the establishment of an additional brigade

headquarters to support the RUC in the border areas, to improve our counter-terrorist

capability there. The remaining forces will continue to support the RUC in the rest of

the Province. This reorganisation will not involve any increase in major units deployed

in Northern Ireland.


CONFIDENTIAL

323. The Royal Navy, which carries out patrols to prevent arms smuggling, and the

RAF, in a wide range of air-support tasks, also make substantial contributions. The

Royal Marines continue to support both Army and Navy operations in the Province.

324. Despite the dedication and professionalism of the security forces, 1987 sadly saw

no diminution in the price they have paid. Eleven soldiers were killed, including eight

members of the UDR, and a further 101 Servicemen were injured. All eight UDR

members were murdered while off duty. Eighty-eight awards for gallantry were made

during the year, in recognition of the heroism of these Servicemen and women.

325. The security forces have made steady progress in bringing terrorists to justice and

in seizing arms and explosives. During 1987, a total of 468 people were charged with

serious offences, including 28 with murder, and 679 people were convicted of offences

related to terrorism. In the same period 267 weapons and almost 20,000 rounds of

ammunition were seized. In 1987 the Royal Army Ordnance Corps&apos; Explosive Ordnance

Disposal (EOD) teams responded to over 1,300 calls; 148 bombs were made safe; and

nearly ten tonnes of explosives were found or neutralised, the highest total since 1976.

OUT-OF-AREA COMMITMENTS

326. During the past 12 months there have been few major changes to our deployments

outside the NATO area, apart from the increase in the contribution made by the Royal

Navy to the protection of our merchant shipping in the Gulf (see page [  ]).

327. We continue to keep permanent garrisons in the Falkland Islands, Hong Kong,

Belize, Brunei and the Sovereign Base Areas of Cyprus. Force levels in the Falklands

are unchanged since last year, but remain under regular review. In Hong Kong, we shall

remain responsible for the defence and internal security of the territory until 1997. We

have yet to formulate final plans for the phased withdrawal of the garrison as 1997

approaches; all decisions will be taken in consultation with the Hong Kong Government.

We have reached agreement in principle with the Hong Kong Government on arrange-

ments for sharing the costs of the garrison from 1 April this year, when the previous

agreement expired. In a routine adjustment of force levels, two of the five Hong Kong

patrol craft and 3 Raiding Squadron Royal Marines are being withdrawn from the

territory during 1988. The force levels and duties of British forces in Brunei, Belize and

Cyprus are unchanged.

328. We regularly exercise our out-of-area capability. PURPLE WARRIOR, in

November 1987, was the largest amphibious exercise mounted by the United Kingdom

Note:

(!)    These deployments were supported

CONFIDENTIAL

since 1945 (see below). Exercise FIRE FOCUS, in March 1988, rehearsed our capability

for rapid reinforcement of the Falkland Islands; the RAF flew some 600 troops and

support personnel to the Islands and deployed four Phantom and one Nimrod aircraft to

augment other aircraft already there. The programme for the rest of 1988 includes

two significant deployments to the Far East and the Pacific. A Royal Navy task group

(OUTBACK 88) will take part in a number of exercises in the region, including, in July,

the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA) naval exercise STARFISH in the South

China Sea and, in September, a combined exercise, SETIA KAWAN, in Brunei, which

will also involve British troops from Hong Kong and the armed forces of the Sultan of

Brunei. RAF Tornados, supported by a Tristar tanker aircraft, will be deployed from

the United Kingdom to take part, in September, in the FPDA air defence exercise LIMA

BERSATU, which will also involve ships and Sea Harriers from the Royal Navy task

force and forces from Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore. The Tornados

will then train with the Royal Thai Air Force and visit other countries in the region

before joining the naval task force again to take part, with other Service

representatives, in the Australian Bicentennial celebrations in October.

329. Our programme of military assistance overseas remains wide-ranging and much

in demand; in 1986-87 over 600 Servicemen were on loan service in countries outside

NATO, and over 3,700 students from such countries attended military training courses

in Britain.

330. Our contribution to international peacekeeping forces has not changed: we

provide contingents to the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai and the United

Nations (UN) forces in Cyprus; and the Cyprus Sovereign Base Areas give logistic

support to the UN forces in Cyprus, Lebanon and on the Golan Heights.

EXERCISE PURPLE WARRIOR

1. Exercise PURPLE WARRIOR, which was held in the Irish Sea and south-west

Scotland in November last year, was the latest in a programme of exercises designed to

develop our ability to react to a crisis outside the NATO area. On this occasion, south-

west Scotland represented a notional state, in a group of islands some 1,500 nautical

miles from the United Kingdom, entitled to our protection. The scenario assumed that

the islands had come under attack from a powerful neighbour.

2. A force comprising 39 ships (including HM Ships Ark Royal, Illustrious and

Intrepid) and two brigades (3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines and 5 Airborne Brigade)

was assembled in southern England and deployed to the scene of conflict. On arrival, an

amphibious operation was mounted in Loch Ryan to secure a beach-head for the landing

of a Joint Force. Simultaneously, an airborne assault by the leading parachute

Battalion Group of 5 Airborne Brigade, delivered by Hercules aircraft of the RAF air


CONFIDENTIAL

transport force, secured West Freugh airfield as a resupply and evacuation air-head.

Once established on land, the Joint Force, supported by over 100 Royal Navy and RAF

helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, simulated the location and evacuation of British

citizens, and went on to practise defensive and counter-attack operations to assist the

local government to regain control.

3. The exercise, involving some 20,000 men, of whom approximately 10,000 were

deployed ashore, was sufficiently large to require notification under the terms of the

Stockholm Document (see paragraph 211).

4. The venture could not have succeeded without the generous cooperation of the

people of Galloway, Arran and Kintyre, not least the farmers who agreed to the use of

their land and the local volunteers who played &apos;evacuee&apos;. Many valuable lessons about

the conduct of joint Service operations were learnt.

THE SERVICES AND THE COMMUNITY

Volunteer Reserves

331. The past year has seen our reserve forces continue to make a valuable and cost-

effective contribution to our defence effort. The TA&apos;s strength is now over 25%

greater than it was in 1979, and 43 out of the planned 47 companies of the HSF have

been formed. In addition, the States of Jersey have agreed to fund a TA Royal Engineer

Field Squadron, to be based on the island of Jersey, as their contribution to the defence

of the British Isles. The R Aux AF and RAF Volunteer Reserve have expanded five-fold

over the same period, and the viability of a support force similar to the TA&apos;s HSF is

under trial. The RNR has increased by some 10% since plans for its expansion were

announced at the end of 1984. The Royal Marines Reserve has increased by more than

50% since 1979. All our reserve forces would play an important role on mobilisation

and in war (see paragraph 302); the TA would provide more than 50,000 troops to BAOR,

including two infantry brigades, as part of the reinforcement of 1(BR) Corps (see page

[ ]).

332. The National Employer Liaison Committee was established in 1986 to provide

independent advice to Ministers on measures needed to improve employers&apos; support for

the volunteer reserves. The committee has concluded that one of the main causes of

turnover in these forces is the shortage of high quality officers needed to maintain the

enthusiasm of subordinates, partly because employees find it difficult to take the

necessary time off work. We are considering the committee&apos;s recommendation that a

campaign be mounted to demonstrate to the public, and especially to employers, the

benefit to be gained from staff whose leadership, management, specialist and technical

skills are improved by military training at no cost to the employer.


CONFIDENTIAL

Cadets

333. Altogether there are now almost 147,000 cadets, both boys and girls - some

22,000 in the Sea Cadet Corps and Sea Scouts, 44,000 in the Army Cadet Force, 39,000

in the Air Training Corps and 42,000 in the Combined Cadet Force. We are making the

cadet forces more attractive for young people by, for example, overseas visits to

Regular units, exchange visits with foreign cadet forces and adventurous training. In

addition, 500 flying scholarships are awarded each year to male cadets and others who

are keen to fly in the RAF, and up to 40 to cadets interested in flying with the Royal

Navy.

334. About one-third of all officer recruits to the armed forces and two-fifths of

other ranks are former cadets, while all cadets develop a lifelong understanding of the

Services. Our aim is to ensure that even those who do not choose a career in the

Services are helped to develop worthwhile interests and the values of good citizenship,

thereby becoming more useful members of the community.

Bomb Disposal

335. During 1987, EOD teams of all three Services were called to investigate 4,312

incidents outside Northern Ireland (see paragraph 325). Of these 3,792 involved

conventional munitions, 66 were terrorist bombs and 454 were false alarms or hoaxes.

The discovery near Tower Bridge in June of a 1,000 kg bomb from the Second World War

led to an operation lasting 32 hours and requiring the evacuation of 350 local residents.

First World War chemical munitions, found buried at the ammunition depot at Bramley

in Hampshire in September, were safely removed.

Search and Rescue

336. During 1987, the Ministry of Defence considered proposals for putting the

search and rescue (SAR) service in the United Kingdom out to civilian contract. Studies

have also been made into the redeployment of military helicopters to provide improved

overall coverage. In February 1988, the Government announced that, wherever there is

a military requirement for SAR, it will continue to be provided by the Royal Navy and

the RAF, whose services will remain available to the wider civilian community.

337. In 1987, SAR helicopters of the Royal Navy and the RAF, and RAF mountain

rescue teams, were called out 1,633 times and rescued or assisted a total of 926 people

in and around the British Isles.   These operations, supported as necessary by RAF


CONFIDENTIAL

Nimrod aircraft, were all guided by the RAF Rescue Coordination Centres at Edinburgh

and Plymouth, working with HM Coastguard. An excellent illustration of this close

cooperation was provided on 31 May when the Coastguard asked for help following a

collision between the British supertanker Skyron and the Polish cargo ship Hel, east of

Ramsgate. While an RAF Nimrod provided top cover, RAF Sea King and Wessex

helicopters and a Royal Navy Sea King transported firemen to the Hel, which was

ablaze, and stood by while the crew transferred to a waiting ferry and the fire was

extinguished. The crew was then able to return to the ship, which continued its voyage

to Amsterdam, while the RAF helicopters returned the firemen to land.

Disaster Relief

338. During 1987, the Services continued to provide disaster relief overseas and

assistance to local communities in the United Kingdom:

In the aftermath of the October gales in southern England, the Army

helped local authorities and water and electricity boards to restore

services and clear debris. Generators and other emergency equipment

were provided for hospitals, old peoples&apos; homes and farms until services

were restored. In the same month, the Army was also called on to provide

an emergency fire service during a strike in West Glamorgan.

Following Cyclone Sally in January, Queens Gurkha Engineers (QGE) were

sent from Hong Kong to work in Aitutaki and Raratonga in the Cook

Islands. They helped restore electrical power and repaired damaged roofs.

Another team of QGE and Royal Engineers from the United Kingdom was

sent to Vanuatu after Cyclone Uma in March, where they rebuilt a number

of schools, carried out specialist electrical work and refurbished several

government buildings. A Royal Engineer adviser and emergency relief

stores were sent to Bermuda in September, to assist the authorities there

in the aftermath of Hurricane Emily.

THE ARMILLA PATROL

[Figure 9]

1. A continuous Royal Navy presence has been maintained in the Gulf and Indian

Ocean area since the beginning of the conflict between Iraq and Iran in 1980, although

it has featured widely in the news headlines only during the last 18 months.

2. Originally the ARMILLA patrol consisted of two warships (destroyers or frigates)

with a support ship. Last year, however, attacks on neutral shipping in the Gulf

increased, in turn stepping up the threat faced by British merchantmen in the area. A

third warship was therefore assigned to the patrol in early 1987, to enable it to respond

more flexibly to events in the region. At any one time, six destroyers or frigates are

now either on patrol, on passage, or working up prior to deployment; this represents

approximately one-eighth of all Royal Navy destroyers and frigates, or about one-sixth

of those vessels normally available for routine peacetime deployments.

3. The United Kingdom is strictly impartial in the conflict between Iran and Iraq.

The ARMILLA patrol provides discreet, low-profile reassurance and, where necessary,

protection to merchant ships owned or registered in the United Kingdom or British

dependent territories. Its presence also underscores the principle of freedom of

navigation in international waters.

4. ARMILLA&apos;s operations are not provocative and are designed to reduce tension; but

the Royal Navy warships engaged in this task are well prepared to exercise their right

of self-defence, both for themselves if attacked, and for merchantmen under their

protection. In addition, ARMILLA ships provide humanitarian assistance, in accordance

with international law, to any distressed or damaged vessels, regardless of nationality,

when human lives are at risk.

5. ARMILLA accompanies most British merchant shipping through the most

threatened areas, the southern Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, which are also the main

areas of British shipping activity. During 1987, over 400 merchant ships were assisted

in this way. No British merchant vessel has been attacked while in company with the

patrol.

6. The discovery of mines in hitherto safe waters off the United Arab Emirates last

year posed new dangers both to British merchant shipping and to the warships of the

ARMILLA patrol. In consequence, it was decided to deploy four Hunt class mine

countermeasures vessels (MCMVs) to the Gulf, together with their support vessels, in

support of the patrol. In the first three months after their arrival in September, they

located and destroyed ten mines, which would otherwise have posed a threat to shipping

of all nationalities. In February 1988, it was decided in the light of the experience

gained that the number of MCMVs in the Gulf could safely be reduced to three.

7. The Government welcomed last year&apos;s decisions by France to increase its naval

presence in the area, and by Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy to send their own naval

forces, including MCMVs. Luxembourg is contributing financially to the Belgian and

Dutch mine-clearance force; and the Federal Republic is providing ships to substitute

for those of other European nations that have had to be diverted from the

Mediterranean.

8. While each nation retains control of its own ships, the Royal Navy maintains a

regular exchange of information with all friendly navies operating in the region. We

have agreed to provide logistic support, and in certain circumstances protection, to the

Dutch and Belgian forces, which are acting jointly and with which we have developed a


CONFIDENTIAL

particularly close working relationship. The Royal Navy has worked alongside the

Belgian and Dutch navies in a successful mine-clearance operation off Qatar, and with

the French and Italian navies in equally successful operations off Fujairah.

9. This European effort, which has been welcomed by the United States, is partly

the result of close and continuing consultations under the auspices of the WEU (see

paragraph 114). Unanimous endorsement within this forum of the need for concerted

action to help maintain freedom of navigation in the Gulf area has led to the most

practical example yet of coordination by European navies outside the NATO area in

peacetime.

CHAPTER FOUR: PROCUREMENT

EQUIPPING THE ARMED FORCES

401. We plan to spend  8,241 million in 1988-89 on equipment for the armed forces.

This represents 43% of the total defence budget, and  1,310 million more in real terms

than was spent in 1978-79.

402. This substantial investment makes the Ministry of Defence the largest single

customer for the products of British industry, which account directly for about 75% of

the equipment budget; another 15% benefits British industry through its participation in

collaborative projects and the remaining 10% is spent abroad. Defence procurement

supports some 350,000 jobs in the United Kingdom, either directly or indirectly, and

thus plays an important role in economic and industrial activity.

403. Equipment expenditure, while well above the 1978-79 level in real terms, has

fallen somewhat from its recent peak. This underlines still further the need to get the

best value from the resources available. The strategy we have adopted to this end is

described on page [ ]. It has two main components: a more commercial approach to

procurement, including improved internal procedures and greater flexibility allowed to

industry; and collaboration with allies.

The Commercial Approach

404. Competition is an essential element in this more commercial approach. The

proportion by value of contracts let on a competitive basis in 1986-87 was 53%,

reflecting a sustained improvement on the 38% of contracts let in this way in 1983-84.

The slight reduction since 1985-86 was caused by the incidence of major projects for

which no competition at the prime-contractor level was possible, for example the first

Trident submarine. But the total value of work placed competitively, at  3,578 million,

was the highest ever; and there was also substantial competition for sub-contracts.

Equally significantly, the value of contracts let on the basis of cost plus a percentage

profit fell from 9% in 1985-86 to 7% in 1986-87; and each such contract is now subject

to a cost ceiling.

^05. This approach is continuing to reduce costs and encourage innovation. For

example, during the last year:

CONFIDENTIAL

in the procurement of sea systems, batch ordering and competition are

together driving down costs. Last July an order was placed, after

competition, for four single-role minehunters at some 10% below the

expected cost. Competition, together with the exploitation of modern

cost-effective technology, has enabled us to achieve considerable savings

in sonars: Sonar 2074, in particular, is being procured at about one-third

the cost of the equipment it is replacing. A similar approach combined

with economies of scale has led to savings of some 40% on the through-

life costs of the communications system for the Type 23 frigate; and

competition saved 30% in the cost of ships&apos; compass transmitting

equipment compared with the best previously quoted price.

In the land systems area, we have achieved savings of 40% in the unit

production cost of the second batch of the S10 respirator. Competition for

the latest order for tank thermal-imaging systems produced 20% savings

against previous budgetary estimates. And the contract for an air

defence simulator showed savings of 40% against other tendered prices.

In the air systems area, a recent competition for Harrier GR5 airframe

fatigue testing resulted in a saving of nearly 70% on the earlier budgetary

estimate. In a competition for the supply of the Tucano trainer aircraft

simulator, the winning tender was more than 40% lower than originally

estimated. Another competition, for a Magnetic Anomaly Detection

System, showed a saving of 65% on the estimated price. And the winning

bid in the recent competition for the supply of the UK Air Command,

Control and Information System was about 40% less than the original

estimated cost.

These 11 examples alone have brought savings totalling  105 million.

406. The success of this policy has been underpinned by encouraging the widest

possible range of companies to compete for our business. This is reflected in a 30%

increase in the number of companies seeking registration as defence contractors; and

more companies are winning contracts. We have achieved this by working for a wider

understanding both of the opportunities available for defence business and of how we

conduct it:

Last year&apos;s Statement reported the launch of our Small Firms Initiative to

introduce ourselves to more companies in this sector of British industry.

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

The response to the creation of the Small Firms Advice Division in the

Ministry of Defence has been encouraging. In the first year of the

initiative more than 1,300 companies have sought advice, and demand

shows no sign of diminishing. The division has held 26 seminars around the

country to explain our procurement policies and, in particular, how small

firms can break into the defence market. Over 1,100 companies have

attended these seminars, and more are planned. The division has also

attended 22 &apos;Meet the Buyer&apos; and other trade exhibitions, where it was

approached by over 1,600 companies.

The MOD Contracts Bulletin, launched in September 1986 to announce

opportunities to compete at both prime- and sub-contract levels, has been

expanded to include details of contracts awarded, offset opportunities for

British companies and, occasionally, the requirements of US forces based

in the United Kingdom. This is in addition to the advertisement of

contracts and tenders valued at  0.5 million or above and opportunities

for British companies in the US SDI programme (see paragraph 424).

Industry has welcomed the bulletin, and we hope to extend and improve it

further in the future.

A further edition of the booklet Selling to the MOD is planned for this

year. We have also published a booklet, widely distributed in the defence

industry and in the City, outlining the organisation and aims of the

Procurement Executive (PE).

A list of contractors paid  5 million or more by the Ministry of Defence in 1986-87 is

given in Volume 2, Table 2.10.

407. Last year we reported the PE&apos;s initiative to make greater use of information

technology to help monitor and control programmes. Recent developments have been

the procurement of management information systems for the Quality Assurance and

Export Services staffs, and an integrated information system for the land systems area.

As an interim measure, additional micro-computers have been introduced into the air

systems area to assist in the management of finance, project reporting, contracts and

project management. The use of information technology in the sea systems area is

being steadily expanded and improved. The management information system for senior

staff concerned with equipment procurement, TOPMAST, is now available to more

staff; and its information base continues to be expanded to include information on

major PE programmes.

CHIPS WITH EVERYTHING

1. Just as the microchip has transformed the industrial economies of the globe and

the daily lives of its inhabitants, so it is revolutionising warfare. On the battlefield of

the future the microchip will be ubiquitous. It will be found in the guidance systems of

missiles, torpedoes and the precision-guided munitions fired by artillery; in increasingly

capable sensors - advanced radars, other electronic and optical devices, and complex

sonars - that give commanders a developing picture of the battle; and in the high-speed

secure command and control systems through which commanders communicate their

orders. Thanks to the chip, tomorrow&apos;s weapons will be more accurately delivered and

controlled and will hit their targets more often.

2. The other side of the coin is that each unit of equipment will be more complex;

and the technical risk of developing new systems, and the danger of time and cost

overruns, is greater. It is now our common experience that weapons systems with a

high content of computing and software are typically the ones that present the greatest

problems of that sort.

3. We must grasp the opportunities offered by these technologies, for the army,

navy or air force that lacks modern weapons is half-way to defeat before it begins to

fight. The answer must be to find a way of managing and controlling, and thus

reducing, the risks involved.

4. A task group led by the Ministry&apos;s Chief Scientific Adviser has examined the

common characteristics of software-intensive projects, including those that have failed

or run into difficulty in the past. It has produced a code of practice for the guidance of

all staffs responsible for the scrutiny, approval or management of such projects. This

guidance, a summary version of which will be made available to industry, is now

routinely applied to all software-intensive projects that come forward for approval,

and is already proving its value. It consists essentially of a series of questions covering

the following ground:

How dependent is the project on software?

Are the characteristics of the system properly defined and understood?

Is the nature and the size of the software development task fully

recognised?

Is a proper management structure in place, with the necessary qualified

and trained staff?

Has a comprehensive and realistic implementation plan been worked out

and agreed between the contractor and the Ministry?

Do the software tools and methods that the contractor proposes to use

accord with the best practice?

5  There is nothing new about any of these questions. By codifying them in this

way, however, we aim to provide, at the outset, the best possible basis for judging

whether a software-intensive project is soundly conceived and likely to be capably

executed. We are thus building on past experience to ensure that in future each such

project will only go ahead when it is established on sound management and technical

principles.

Equipment Collaboration

408. We have pressed on with our efforts to achieve value for money through wider

and more effective collaboration in equipment procurement. Within the Alliance the

main multilateral fora for this activity are the Independent European Programme Group

(IEPG), which is responsible for developing cooperation within Europe, and the

Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD), which promotes the same aim

Alliance-wide. The activities of the two are complementary rather than competitive.

It is the role of the IEPG to help achieve a more effective European contribution to the

Alliance (see paragraph 113) by eliminating wasteful duplication of effort.

409. Last year we reported the steps being taken by the IEPG to make European

defence industry more competitive. IEPG Ministers have welcomed the report of the

independent study team, which recommended that this aim could best be achieved by

opening up Europe&apos;s internal armaments market to a much greater degree. They have

commissioned an action plan for pursuing the report&apos;s proposals and will consider this at

their next meeting.

410. Good progress continues to be made in other areas of the IEPG&apos;s activities. In

the last year, a further two European staff targets have been agreed, bringing the total

in the past three and a half years to 15; the United Kingdom subscribes to nine of these.

Vitally important though harmonised operational requirements and timescales clearly

are, the acid test for European collaboration will be the initiation and follow-through of

actual programmes based on these agreed staff targets. A useful, if modest, start has

been made with the decision to launch a one-year study of the next generation medium-

range surface-to-air missile.

411. The need for collaborative research in Europe was a key feature of the

revitalisation of the IEPG in 1984, and it has been underlined at successive Ministerial

meetings. Encouraging progress is being made: 20 cooperative technology programmes

are now under way and, of these, the United Kingdom is participating in 17. The IEPG

recognises that joint European research has to be more systematic, and considerable

efforts are being made to that end, focusing initially on the application of advanced

materials and computing.

^12. In December 1987, NATO Ministers agreed in principle to create a Conventional

Armaments Planning System (CAPS). It is intended that the CAPS should encourage

cooperation among member countries by providing the armaments community with a

CONFIDENTIAL



CONFIDENTIAL

framework within which to analyse national long-term armaments goals and to review

how far national plans will meet Alliance needs. Detailed procedures for a two-year

trial of the CAPS are now being drawn up by CNAD.

413. CNAD also continues to be the focus for collaboration in response to the Nunn

Amendment, which has set aside funds from the US defence budget for collaborative

research and development. In the last year the United Kingdom has signed four further

Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) for such projects, including one for the

development of the Question and Answer component of the NATO Identification

System.

414. Table 5 provides a list of collaborative equipment currently in service or

projects at various stages of development or study. Production of Harrier GR5 is

continuing, as are deliveries of the Tornado aircraft (see paragraphs 315-316). Flight

testing for the development of the Anglo-Italian EH 101 helicopter has been under way

for six months. Good progress has been made on the evaluation of the results of the

project definition phase of the European Fighter Aircraft project and on the negotiation

with industry of the contractual terms that would govern full development. We

announced in January this year our decision to participate in the project definition

phase of the NATO Frigate Replacement for the 1990s (NFR 90), subject to the

realistic and proper alignment of timetables for the ship and weapon system

programmes at an early stage. We are also taking part in two new studies to identify

future naval anti-air warfare missile systems. [And we are now proceeding to full

development of the Third Generation Anti-Tank Guided Weapon (TRIGAT) with our

French and German partners.]

415. A new initiative was launched in 1987, when the first Anglo-French Defence

Equipment Conference was held at Lancaster House; senior officials and industrialists

met to exchange information on future requirements. The first conference focused on

land systems. A similar event dealing with sea systems was held in March 1988, and one

covering air systems is planned for later this year. French and British Defence

Ministers endorsed this initiative when they met in December 1987. They also

announced the establishment of a joint committee of officials to oversee arrangements

to publicise contract opportunities in France and the United Kingdom in order to

encourage purchases of each other&apos;s equipment.

THE TRIDENT PROGRAMME

1. It is now six years since the Government decided to replace the British Polaris

force with another four-submarine force armed with the Trident II D5 strategic weapon

system, and the programme remains on course for entry into service in the mid- 1990s.

At average 1987-88 prices and at an exchange rate of $1.62 to the pound (the rate used,

by convention, for this year&apos;s recosting of the defence programme), the cost of the

programme is estimated at  9,043 million; this represents a fall in real terms of

 1,038 million compared with the original 1982 estimate. The cost of those elements of

the programme to be procured from the United States is currently estimated at some

36% of the total.

2. The construction of the first two submarines, HMS Vanguard and HMS

Victorious, is going well; and they are due to begin trials in the early 1990s. When

orders for the remaining two boats have been placed and the programme reaches its

peak, in 1990, it will be providing some 27,000 jobs in this country.

3. The development of the Trident D5 missile in the United States is on schedule.

The test flight programme has, to date, achieved a very high level of success; test

firings from submarines are planned to begin in Spring 1989.

4. The construction programme at the Clyde Submarine Base in Scotland, where

the Trident submarines will be based, is one of the largest in the United Kingdom. In

the past year asbestos clearance from the Faslane site has been completed, as has a

large programme of site preparation at the Royal Naval Armament Depot (RNAD),

Coulport. Three new roads are now open, diverting construction traffic from local

towns and villages. Contracts have been let for a ship-lift, to enable the submarines to

be serviced out of the water, and for the construction of the explosives area and a

generating station. Tenders have been invited for a floating jetty at the RNAD, and a

start has been made on the refitting facility at Rosyth.

5. The latest estimate of the capital savings achieved by having Trident missiles

serviced in the US facility at King&apos;s Bay, Georgia, rather than in the United Kingdom is

some  770 million. In addition, this arrangement will save running costs throughout the

life of the programme. Missiles (but not their British-manufactured warheads) will be

sent to King&apos;s Bay after every seven or eight years of deployment, and replacements

will be taken into service. These arrangements, reached in 1982, in no way affect the

independence of our deterrent, which, with its British warheads and British-owned

missiles, will remain at all times under the control of the British Government.

DEFENCE RESEARCH

416. A total of  403 million has been provided for defence research in the defence

budget for 1988-89. This represents about 2% of the total budget and some 4% of

planned expenditure on equipment procurement (see paragraph 401).

417. Last year&apos;s Statement recorded the Government&apos;s concern to ensure that

defence does not pre-empt an excessive share of the nation&apos;s technological resources.

To that end we continue to pay very close attention to the real level of defence

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

research and development (R&amp;D) expenditure, the aim being to achieve a gradual

reduction over the next decade. This will involve looking very carefully at what is

available off the shelf and at the opportunities for international collaboration, before

embarking on major new programmes. There will, however, be no abrupt change; the

Ministry of Defence will continue to fund R&amp;D in industry on a substantial scale.

418. The last year has seen further notable achievements by the defence research

establishments:

three Queen&apos;s Awards for Technological Achievement have been shared

with industry: The Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE) and the

English Electric Valve Company won two, for improvements to thermal-

imaging cameras and work on image intensifiers; and the Royal Aircraft

Establishment (RAE) shared an award with GEC Avionics for work on

night-vision technology for aircraft.

RAE&apos;s development, with Alcan International, of aluminium lithium alloys,

which are both stiffer and lighter than other such alloys, is being

successfully marketed, particularly in North America; and RAE&apos;s

development, with Westland Helicopters, of advanced rotor systems is

being exploited in the development of EH 101.

The Viper high integrity microprocessor, based on RSRE research, was

launched as the first such system to be made available commercially; it is

ideally suited to applications where safety is critical, as in road and rail

traffic control and avionics.

The Admiralty Research Establishment has developed special equipment

for the detection, avoidance and disposal of mines, for use by the Royal

Navy&apos;s MCM squadron in the Gulf.

Successful research at the Royal Armament Research and Development

Establishment into low-cost techniques of chemical synthesis has shown

the potential for application of similiar techniques in the fertiliser and

pharmaceutical industries.

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

Research carried out at the Chemical Defence Establishment (CDE) into

gas and aerosol detection has led to the development of technology for

environmental control in hospital operating theatres; and CDE research

into microbiological defence has led to a new design of hypodermic

syringe, already being used in the civil sector, which reduces the risk of

injury.

These five research establishments, and the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental

Establishment at Boscombe Down, are being considered, as a group, for possible agency

status under the Government&apos;s plans for improving management in the public sector (see

paragraphs 510-511).

419. We remain committed to harnessing the capabilities of the defence research

establishments for the benefit of the wider economy. Defence Technology Enterprises

Ltd (DTE) is now well established in its role of encouraging private industry to exploit

technology originating in our establishments. It has representatives at four of the

larger research establishments, and has attracted over 260 companies as associate

members. As a result of its work so far, DTE has arranged 32 licenses or signed options

with companies to use Ministry of Defence technology. Substantial additional

technology development at a cost of some  5 million has been undertaken by the

companies concerned, which are expected to achieve sales worth  40 million over six

years from the resulting products. Further licenses are under negotiation. A new

development has been the launch, with the Department of Trade and Industry, of the

Civil Industrial Access Scheme. This is designed to encourage civil industry to make

greater use of the expertise that the defence research establishments can provide

through collaborative work, the use of their facilities, and advice and consultancy.

GRUINARD ISLAND

1. 1987 saw the successful decontamination of Gruinard Island (off the north-west

coast of Scotland), which had been infected with anthrax spores during the Second

World War. After many years when it was thought that decontamination would not be

possible, infected areas were treated with a solution of formaldehyde and sea water and

sampled, using new techniques, to establish that the remedy had worked.

ESSAY

THE CONVENTIONAL BALANCE

1. An accurate assessment of the potential threat is no less important now than it

has ever been. History furnishes many examples of military defeat arising from miscal-

culation of the enemy&apos;s strength. Each year we publish in this Statement a particular

type of threat assessment, the balance between NATO and the Warsaw Pact of

conventional and nuclear forces in Europe. The recent progress of arms control

negotiations and the debate on defence policy in this country have served to focus

attention on the conventional balance, so it is timely to consider the problems inherent

in generating these force-level figures (and hence their accuracy), and whether the

message implied by the numbers needs tempering by considerations such as the quality

of equipment or its manning.

The Figures

2. As we have explained in past Statements, there are genuine problems in arriving

at completely accurate figures. They include:

How to decide which forces to count? The most straightforward approach

might, at first sight, be to count each side&apos;s total forces world-wide. But a

realistic global balance would not only be extremely difficult to draw up, it

would also be largely irrelevant to our main concerns. For, short of a full-

scale strategic nuclear exchange between the superpowers, any East-West

conflict would be fought in Europe - the area that in any event most directly

affects our own security. While, therefore, compiling global balances can be

an interesting academic exercise, our aim has been to focus as far as

possible on the forces that would be most relevant to a war in Europe. That

is why this Statement covers not only the forces on the Central Front, which

would be involved immediately in any European conflict, but also forces in

the whole of Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals, which could be deployed

quickly to the Central Front, or which could be involved early in any

fighting on the northern and southern flanks.

How to count accurately? The Warsaw Pact has over the years maintained

tight secrecy about all aspects of its military forces. For example, it has

consistently refused to discuss its own force levels in MBFR negotiations

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

over the last 15 years, and only last year admitted for the first time to

having a chemical warfare capability. Counting its forces cannot,

therefore, be an exact science. Large items, such as ships, are easy to

count; smaller ones, such as tanks and artillery pieces, less so; while others,

such as anti-tank guided weapons, are almost impossible to count

accurately. Similarly, it can be relatively easy to identify missile launchers,

but not the number of spare (or reload) missiles available.

Where to draw the line? Arbitrary lines have to be drawn between, say,

frigates and patrol boats, or tanks and armoured reconnaissance vehicles.

Putting a border-line case into one category rather than another could have

a significant effect on the resulting balance. Similar problems can be

caused by differing interpretations of the readiness states of certain units

on both sides, and by uncertainties about where specific units are normally

based.

3. There is thus obvious scope for assessments to differ, either because different

counting rules have been applied or because interpretations of the available evidence

vary.   Nonetheless, the figures produced by the most reputable independent bodies

present broadly the same picture of Warsaw Pact numerical superiority (although, for&apos;

the reasons explained above, they may differ in detail).

The Technological Gap

4. It is sometimes argued that Warsaw Pact numerical superiorities can be

discounted because they are offset by NATO&apos;s technological lead. Certainly the West

still has a lead in many areas; but it is being eroded by the continuing deployment of

new Soviet weapons with improved flexibility and performance. And, although the West

is often ahead in the race to develop technologies, the Soviet Union is often quicker to

apply and deploy them, as has been demonstrated by the introduction of explosive

reactive armour for tanks, an idea first developed in the West but now widely applied by

the Soviet Union.

5. In practice, both East and West design weapons to reflect different needs,

resources, and approaches to problems, greatly complicating attempts to compare their

capabilities. The Soviet Union, for instance, requires large numbers of rugged and

relatively uncomplicated weapons for use by conscript forces, exploiting the bias of the

Soviet bloc economies towards heavy engineering; while in the West we seek to exploit

our technological strengths to minimise the diversion of manpower from the productive

economy to defence.

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL &apos;

6. In general, Soviet design philosophy has emphasised three main features:

Simplicity. Simple designs can be durable, cheap, and easy to produce,

operate and maintain. But simplicity often also reflects technological lag,

and may carry a penalty of lower combat capability, or less flexibility.

Standardisation. Weapon components are, wherever possible,

interchangeable, and existing designs and technologies are adapted for new

purposes. This approach can be applied in practice because the Soviet Union

can impose standard equipment on its Warsaw Pact allies.

Evolution. The Soviet Union often adopts an evolutionary approach to

weapon development; the Kalashnikov assault rifle, for example, which was

based on a wartime German design, has evolved by stages into the essen-

tially similar but modern AK-74. By contrast, the West&apos;s approach has been

to introduce new models, each representing a distinct new generation of

technology.

7. The most critical Soviet weakness lies in the electronics sector. Here the in-

ability to produce enough high quality micro-electronic components not only limits the

technology that can be incorporated in new weapon systems, but has also inhibited the

exploitation of automated design and manufacturing techniques. The West also leads in

a number of other key technologies, including electro-optical sensors (such as infra-

red), robotics, signal processing, telecommunications (including fibre-optics) and

signature reduction (stealth). The Warsaw Pact is roughly equal to the West in aero-

dynamics, conventional and nuclear warheads, and directed energy (lasers); and it is

catching up in fields such as guidance and navigation, new materials, propulsion, radar

sensors and submarine detection. The Soviet Union is probably ahead of the West in

specific charged-particle devices, some areas of high-energy physics, the use of

titanium for submarine construction, and the development of mobile ground-based long-

range ballistic missiles.

8. The Western technological challenge has led the Soviet Union to increase the

planning priority given to science and technology, to remove bureaucratic barriers

between research, development and production, and to collect Western military

technology through its intelligence and trading agencies. Technology transfer from

West to East has helped it to reduce development costs and allowed it to respond

rapidly to Western technological improvements. In the paragraphs that follow we look

at the implications of this approach in key equipment areas. We have concentrated on

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

ground and air forces to the exclusion of naval forces, because the former are the areas

of offensive capability addressed in conventional arms control negotiations.

The Quality of Equipment

9. The complexities of comparing the capabilities of specific equipments are well

illustrated in the case of tanks. Both the Warsaw Pact and NATO have a large variety

of different tank models in service; this, together with differences in design philosophy,

makes comparisons difficult. It would, however, be untrue to claim that NATO has an

advantage in the quality of its tanks across the board. This may have been true in

comparison with some of the older Soviet tanks, such as the T-55 or T-62, when they

were introduced. But many of these have been modernised and upgraded with new

gunnery control systems, and improved ammunition and armour, which enable them to

fulfil a useful role on the battlefield.

10. Modern Soviet tanks, the T-64A, T64B, T-72 and T-80, are as capable as the latest

NATO tanks, the M-l (US), Leopard II (FRG) and Challenger (UK). Their armour,

supplemented by explosive reactive armour, provides protection comparable to and

often higher than that of Western tanks. They have a 125mm gun, a larger calibre than

those mounted on NATO tanks; and the T-64B and T-80 can fire anti-tank missiles

through the gun barrel. This may give Pact tanks a slight edge in fire power, but it

needs to be set against a continued NATO lead in gunnery control, target acquisition

and night vision systems.

11. Of the 17,000 Warsaw Pact tanks on the Central Front (see Figure 15), over half

are of the modern types - that is, more than the total number of NATO tanks in the

area. Among the Soviet forces in the German Democratic Republic, the proportion of

modern tanks - 6,000 out of 7,000 - is even higher. If the comparison is extended to

include Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals (See Figure 16), the Warsaw Pact retains

the advantage: more than half of the 50,000 Pact tanks deployed there are modern,

compared with NATO&apos;s total of 17,000 tanks.

12. The Warsaw Pact&apos;s superiority in artillery, in quality as well as quantity, is not

seriously disputed. Its 3:1 advantage on the Central Front reflects both the Soviet

army&apos;s historical emphasis on firepower in its operational doctrine, and its deter-

mination to produce purpose-built mobile artillery systems for all formations from

Front down to Regiment. The total figures for the Central Front include over 4,000

2S-1 (122mm) and 2S-3 (152mm) self-propelled guns deployed with Warsaw Pact forces,

compared with a NATO holding of about 1,900 generally older and less capable guns in

the same category. And, while the West probably still enjoys an advantage in the range

CONFIDENTIAL



CONFIDENTIAL

of its medium guns and howitzers and retains its lead in terminally-guided sub-

munitions, improvements in Warsaw Pact ammunition over the next few years are likely

to reinforce still further the effect of the Warsaw Pact&apos;s numerical superiority, both by

improving the sustainable rate of fire per barrel and by increasing lethality.

13. NATO&apos;s introduction of the 12-tube Multiple-Launch Rocket System will narrow

the gap to some extent. NATO plans to deploy about 750 of these systems and the

programme is now under way (see paragraph 606). But the Warsaw Pact has some 1,500

such systems already in service on the Central Front, including the most modern 16-

tube 220mm BM-27.

14. The Warsaw Pact has also been improving its air forces. For example, hundreds of

the latest generation of Soviet fighter aircraft, the Flanker and Fulcrum, have been

brought into service over the past few years, and they are broadly comparable with the

US F-15, F-16 and F-18 aircraft. In technological terms, the West still has a lead of

about five years, but the gap is closing. The new aircraft represent a major increase in

capability when compared to their predecessors; they are equipped with look-

down/shoot-down radar and improved missiles.

The Quality of Men

15. The superior training of NATO&apos;s armed forces is often cited as an important

counter-weight to the Warsaw Pact&apos;s numerical advantage; and there is no doubt that

one of NATO&apos;s strengths lies in the professionalism and versatility of its servicemen.

NATO forces have a lower proportion of conscripts in their ranks, and their servicemen

are generally better educated and more resourceful.

16. But such comparisons can be misleading. Soviet military doctrine (see page [ ])

does not require the soldier in the field to show initiative, but rather to carry out

certain set battle drills quickly and efficiently. Most Warsaw Pact conscripts spend two

years (compared to the NATO average of one year) learning to do just that.

17. Warsaw Pact plans are as well rehearsed as NATO&apos;s. For 1988, for example, under

the terms of the Stockholm Document, the Warsaw Pact declared 22 exercises involving

13,000 or more soldiers, compared with NATO&apos;s 12. Major exercises (ie those involving

100,000 or more troops) are rarely held by either side, but both NATO and the Warsaw

Pact conduct frequent command post exercises to rehearse their headquarters staffs in

the procedures for moving and controlling large numbers of men and equipment in

action.

CONFIDENTIAL

Striking a Balance

18. We have focused so far on the quality of equipment and manpower. But there are

other factors that would affect the outcome of any conflict, and where NATO is often

at a disadvantage compared with the Warsaw Pact. The free commitment of NATO&apos;s 16

members gives the Alliance an innate strength that the Warsaw Pact lacks; but this has

been achieved at a price. NATO&apos;s command structure is relatively complex, to ensure

that all NATO members are involved in important decisions; at the same time the

forces committed to NATO retain their national characteristics and are not all tailored

to an exclusively European role. In contrast, the command structure of the Warsaw

Pact is in effect that of the Soviet Union, offering obvious advantages of command and

control and the potential to react quickly to events; unlike NATO, all Warsaw Pact

forces are structured, trained and equipped to follow a single clearly defined military

doctrine. And the greater diversity of national equipments deployed by NATO forces,

all requiring their own spares and logistic support, could create operational problems

for the Alliance not shared by the Warsaw Pact.

19. Nor is geography on NATO&apos;s side. Unlike the Warsaw Pact, the Alliance with its

limited territory cannot trade space for time in order to concentrate its forces against

an attack. The Pact&apos;s supply lines for men, equipment and materiel are relatively short

and overland, compared with NATO&apos;s reliance on transatlantic reinforcement (see page

[ ]). And not least, by committing itself never to be the first to use force, NATO has

eschewed the military advantage that the initiative confers. A potential aggressor can

select the time and place of his attack and mass his forces to achieve overwhelming

local superiority in numbers, while a defender can only seek to respond before his

defence is irretrievably disrupted.

20. Qualitative factors such as those discussed in this essay are scarcely susceptible

to objective measurement; and attempts to produce statements of the balance weighted

to take such considerations into account rarely command universal approval. Their

implications for our assessment of the threat facing NATO must therefore be a matter

of judgement. But those who argue that we can afford to discount the numerical

superiority of Warsaw Pact forces do so by looking selectively at those areas where

NATO enjoys some qualitative advantage. And judgements about relative quality are

often exaggerated: older Warsaw Pact tanks, for example, are more easily written off

on paper than on the north German plain. A more balanced view would be that

qualitative factors, as this essay illustrates, are often a matter of fine distinctions, and

that they work both ways since, in any conflict, NATO would suffer from significant

disadvantages compared with the Warsaw Pact. So, although we must take quality and

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

similar considerations into account, it is a false and dangerous delusion to discount the

reality of the numbers.

CHAPTER SIX: THE FORCES OF EAST AND WEST

CONVENTIONAL FORCES

601. The signing of the INF Treaty last December served, once again, to highlight

the importance of tackling the disparities in conventional forces in Europe between

NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Assessing the conventional balance is a complex task, for

reasons explained on page [ ]. But an objective assessment is essential both for

determining the defence effort required of the West, and as a prerequisite for the

negotiation of conventional force reductions.

602. The conventional forces of France and Spain are included on the NATO side, as

indicated, in the comparisons that follow. But these countries do not participate in

NATO&apos;s integrated military structure.

Land and Air Forces

603. The evidence available to us continues to show a sizeable Warsaw Pact

numerical superiority in military force. Figure 15 shows the conventional forces of

NATO and the Warsaw Pact in place on the Central Front - that is, NATO forces in the

Benelux countries and the Federal Republic of Germany, and Warsaw Pact forces

estimated to be in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic.

Figure 16 gives a broader picture of conventional forces in place from the Atlantic to

the Urals. For the purposes of this Statement, that includes forces located in the 14

NATO countries in Europe, and Warsaw Pact forces in Eastern Europe and the 11

military districts of the Soviet Union west of the Ural mountains.

Developments in Warsaw Pact Forces

604. The continuing modernisation of ground forces during the past year has been

accompanied by some restructuring. And technological advances have continued to

reduce the superiority of NATO equipment (see page [ ]). Deliveries have continued

of new equipment such as the T-80 tank and the BMP-2 armoured infantry combat

vehicle, which benefit from improved mobility, firepower and armoured protection

(including reactive armour in the case of the T-80). There have been increases in

holdings of self-propelled artillery, for example the 2S-3, 2S-7 and 2S-9, of tactical

surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), and of short-range surface-to-surface ballistic missiles

(SRBMs), such as the SS-21 capable of delivering improved conventional warheads with

greater accuracy.   Recent organisational changes have included some regrouping of

divisional helicopters, which will improve operational capabilities and give commanders

more flexibility in the field. In addition, the Pact&apos;s capability for close air support of

ground forces has been enhanced by further deliveries of the Hind attack helicopter and

the Frogfoot ground-attack aircraft. Hardened command, control and communications

systems, together with improved computer data processing and fire-control systems,

are now comparable to Western systems.

605. Replacement of the air forces&apos; older fighters by Fulcrum and Flanker has

continued. These modern agile combat aircraft with significantly improved avionics

enhance the Pact&apos;s ability to conduct deep-ranging offensive air operations and to

support ground and naval forces. Soviet air defence capabilities have also been

improved markedly by the combination of Flanker and Foxhound fighters with the

Mainstay airborne early warning aircraft, which extends Soviet air defence boundaries

especially against low-flying targets. New training programmes for aircrews are also

being introduced to complement these improvements in equipment.

NATO Forces

606. NATO countries have also introduced new equipment for their ground forces

during 1987 both through replacement programmes and additional purchases. For

example, the NATO tank fleet has been strengthened by the introduction of further

Leopard II, Challenger, AMX-B2 and improved M-l Abrams tanks. At the same time,

progress has been made with programmes to enhance the capability of existing tanks by

retrofitting advanced fire-control systems and improved armour. NATO infantry&apos;s

battlefield mobility continues to be upgraded by the acquisition of new armoured

vehicles such as the Bradley M2/M3, VAB and Warrior. During the year the United

States completed the first stage of fielding MLRS: one battalion for each division with

an additional battalion for each corps. Several other NATO nations took delivery of

their first MLRS at the start of a programme that will greatly improve the range,

accuracy and effectiveness of NATO artillery.

607. The anti-armour capabilities of NATO ground forces are being increased by the

introduction of significant numbers of anti-armour guns, anti-armour missile launchers

of the Milan and TOW types and enlarged ammunition stocks. Operational and tactical

flexibility is being improved by the introduction of more combat and heavy-lift

helicopters in direct support of ground forces.

608. NATO air forces introduced 200 new combat aircraft during the year in both air

defence and ground-attack variants, mostly of Tornado, Mirage and F-16 types.

Existing aircraft continue to be updated by the addition of improved avionics and

modern weapons such as AIM9L(Sidewinder) and the 3P233 runway denial system;

aircraft survivability is being enhanced by improved electronic countermeasures and

radar-warning systems. In addition to Patriot SAM deployments under way in the

Central Region, airfield defences are being strengthened by the introduction of more

point-defence SAM systems and hardened aircraft shelters.

(1)    Source: US Secretary of Defense&apos;s Annual Report to Congress for the Fiscal Year

1988. French and Spanish production is not included.

1. The high levels of production sustained by Soviet defence industries are necessary

to maintain the combat effectiveness of a large standing army, modernise the holdings

of strategic equipment reserves and sustain a role as a major arms exporter. Capital

investment in the defence industries over the last decade has been running at high

levels. But, as in NATO, the cost of developing and producing new weapons is

increasing.

2. In the last five years new generation weapon systems have entered production in

the Soviet Union, and their increasing complexity and cost have been offset in part by

reduced production rates. Production of the latest tactical fighters and newest

nuclear-powered attack submarines is below levels previously sustained. Fighter

production fell sharply with the decline of the large and long-running Flogger

programme, but is now expected to grow slowly as output of the new generation

fighters, Fulcrum and Flanker, increases. The overall output of ground forces&apos;

equipment, however, is not far short of the long-term average, despite the introduction

of new more capable vehicles such as the gas turbine-powered T-80 tank.


CONFIDENTIAL

3. Weapons production in the non-Soviet Warsaw Pact countries is small compared

with the Soviet Union and concentrated mainly on the less demanding designs of ground

forces&apos; equipment, minor naval vessels and transport helicopters and aircraft. Even so

Poland and Czechoslovakia between them produce many more tanks each year than does

the United Kingdom. And their output is increasing now they are producing Soviet T-72

tanks under licence.

Maritime Forces

609. Figure 17 shows the principal naval forces of NATO and the Warsaw Pact

normally located or based in the North Atlantic and seas bordering Europe. Ships and

submarines could be deployed anywhere in this area, but forces have been divided

according to sea or fleet areas relating to their home bases.

610. The numerical balance does not, however, tell the whole story. At sea, NATO&apos;s

mission to protect the Alliance&apos;s reinforcement and resupply lines requires

proportionately larger numbers of surface escorts, hunter-killer submarines and aircraft

than the Warsaw Pact would need to threaten them. The conventional wisdom,

applicable to land warfare, requiring an attacker to outnumber a defender is thus

reversed. Both world wars have demonstrated the damage that can be caused by a

relatively small number of submarines, and the potential threat posed by the Soviet

submarine fleet is on a far larger scale than any we have faced before.

Developments in Warsaw Pact Naval Forces

611. Soviet naval deployments away from their home fleet areas have steadily reduced

over the last two years, apparently reflecting improved planning to make more

effective use of resources. The result has been an improvement in combat efficiency

and readiness, and fuller integration of naval forces into combined arms operations.

Nevertheless, Soviet naval units continue to be deployed to those parts of the world,

such as the Mediterranean and the Gulf area, where the leadership requires Soviet

influence or concern to be apparent. The newer Soviet submarines, which are still being

completed at an average rate of one every six weeks, are showing clear design

improvements over their predecessors, narrowing the technological lead long held by

the West; in particular, they are becoming quieter, making detection increasingly

difficult. The introduction of new airborne command and control and anti-submarine

warfare aircraft should also serve to enhance Soviet maritime capabilities. The

strike/attack potential of the Soviet Naval Air Force continues to improve as more

variable geometry Backfire bombers enter service.

&apos; Prance and Spain are members of NATO, but do not participate in its integrated military structure. Their naval forces are divided between

the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.


NATO Maritime Forces

612. Significant improvements are being made to NATO&apos;s maritime forces through the

commissioning of new and more advanced vessels. While the United States continues its

force expansion towards the ultimate goal of a 600-ship navy deployed globally,

European NATO members introduced new ships and aircraft last year, including two

Type 22 frigates, a Meko class guided missile frigate, a Minerva class escort, two

Alkmaar class mine countermeasures vessels, a Sauro class submarine and some 25

maritime Tornado aircraft. In addition, there is a continuing programme to upgrade

existing vessels, maritime aircraft, and weapons.

RELATIVE REINFORCEMENT CAPABILITY

1. The forces in place on the Central Front (see Figure 15) amount to some 57

Warsaw Pact and 33 NATO divisions, most of them at high levels of readiness. Were

war to break out in Europe, therefore, both sides could, if necessary, conduct operations

for a short period without being reinforced. The Warsaw Pact, for example, has the

capability to launch a surprise attack with its standing forces in the German

Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia: and NATO&apos;s forces would counter by

implementing the initial stages of its strategy of forward defence (see page [ ]). But,

if hostilities were to continue for more than a very few days, both sides would aim to

reinforce their in-place forces.

2. NATO plans to reinforce Europe with some 15 divisions from Canada, Portugal,

the United Kingdom and the United States, while the units already in place would be

increased in strength as reservists became available after mobilisation. NATO forces

that, in peace, are based outside the Federal Republic could also be deployed to meet

any threat on the Central Front. In addition, although France does not participate in

NATO&apos;s integrated military structure, some 50,000 French troops are based in the

Federal Republic and could immediately be made available to support NATO.

3. The United States has defined its priority aim in reinforcing Europe as being the

deployment of an additional six army divisions, and 60 tactical fighter squadrons within

ten days. Equipment for these divisions is already pre-positioned in Europe. The

remaining reinforcements would arrive in a longer time frame, SACEUR&apos;s target being

to achieve this within 30 days. Not all these would necessarily be deployed to the

Central Front, and some might be required for use outside the European theatre of

operations.

4. On the Warsaw Pact side there is a total of some 200 divisions west of the Ural

mountains. Of these, in addition to the 57 on the Central Front, there are

approximately another 65 in the remainder of Eastern Europe and the most westerly

military districts of the Soviet Union, many of which could be brought into action

immediately or within a short time; remaining units, west of the Urals, could form a

further echelon of forces to back up and exploit attacks already launched by the forces

further forward.

CONFIDENTIAL


5. While not all of these would be used on the Central Front (just as not all of

NATO&apos;s reinforcements would necessarily go there), a high proportion of these forces

would be deployed to that area in wartime. The time taken to do this would vary

depending on the levels of readiness of units and their distance from the combat zone.

But many divisions are already at very high levels of readiness or capable of being

mobilised within a few days; it would take 10-14 days to transport reinforcement

divisions to the Central Front from the west of the Soviet Union. All Warsaw Pact

forces west of the Urals are positioned within 3,000 km of the IGB. Pact lines of

communication are thus shorter and (being overland) safer and faster than NATO&apos;s,

which stretch twice as far back across the Atlantic Ocean.

NUCLEAR FORCES

Strategic Forces

613. Strategic forces are those whose range or type of delivery system allows them to

undertake intercontinental attack. They include intercontinental ballistic missiles

(ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and heavy bombers equipped

with bombs and air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs). For the purposes of this

comparison we have used the definition adopted in the SALT II Treaty.

614. Both the Soviet Union and the United States have, over the past year, continued

to modernise their strategic forces. At the end of 1987 the Soviet Union had deployed

about 100 of its mobile ICBMs, the SS-25. Another ICBM, the SS-X-24, which could

carry up to ten warheads and is capable of being launched from either silos or mobile

launchers, is close to initial deployment. The capability of the Soviet SLBM force

continues to improve as more of the new Typhoon and Delta class nuclear-powered

ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) are deployed carrying the multiple warhead SS-N-

20 and SS-N-23 missiles. The Typhoon class SSBN is the world&apos;s largest submarine and

is capable of carrying 20 SS-N-20 SLBMs. Five submarines in this class, and four Delta

IV, have been completed so far.

615. The Soviet Union is also developing a range of strategic cruise missiles for launch

from ground, sea and air platforms. The AS-15 ALCM is already in service on the Bear

H heavy bomber, and about 60 such aircraft are now in the inventory. Deployment of

the new strategic aircraft, the Blackjack, could begin before the end of this decade.

This aircraft will also be capable of carrying cruise missiles. The SS-N-21 submarine-

launched land-attack cruise missile, having a maximum range of over 2,500 km, is now

believed to be operational, and the longer-range SS-NX-24 is at an advanced stage of

development. Although these systems are classified as strategic, they could all be

deployed against NATO forces in Europe.

616. The Soviet Union is also continuing to improve its ground-based radars and

satellite detection systems in order to enhance its capability for ballistic missile

detection and to provide threat assessment information. Part of this programme

includes the construction, near Moscow, of a large anti-ballistic missile (ABM) defence

radar, as part of the world&apos;s only operational ABM system.

617. The United States&apos; nuclear posture is similarly based on a combination of ICBMs,

SLBMs and long-range bombers. The strategic modernisation programme, announced in

1981, sought to revitalise each leg of this triad. To this end, the United States has

begun to deploy the MX, or Peacekeeper, ICBM and the B-1B strategic bomber. Trident

(Ohio-class) submarines each carrying the Trident C4 SLBM are now being deployed at

the rate of about one a year; eight Trident SSBNs have been launched so far. By the

end of the decade, the US SLBM capability will be further improved by the introduction

of the D-5 Trident SLBM. B-52 bombers have been modified to carry ALCMs; and the

development of an advanced cruise missile and advanced-technology bomber, both based

on low-observable or stealth technology, is now under way. Sea-launched cruise

missiles (SLCMs) are being deployed on a variety of ships and submarines.

618. Figure 18 illustrates the balance of strategic systems and shows that there is

rough parity between the Soviet Union and United States in the numbers of delivery

systems. As explained, however, in previous Statements, it is very difficult to estimate

the number of warheads actually carried by each system with any accuracy. Interpre-

tation of the balance is further complicated by the asymmetry between the two sides&apos;

forces. For example, the Soviet Union places a heavy reliance on its ICBMs and has

three times the missile throw-weight of the United States in this category of weapons.

It could, therefore, attack all US land-based missiles while keeping part of its ICBM

force in reserve. On the other hand, the United States enjoys an advantage in SLBMs

which, though less accurate than ICBMs, are virtually invulnerable to a first strike,

leaving the United States with the ability to retaliate.

Intermediate Nuclear Forces

619. Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) include all systems that fall between short-

range (ie battlefield) and strategic forces. They comprise longer-range intermediate

and shorter-range intermediate nuclear forces (LRINF and SRINF).   LRINF systems

CONFIDENTIAL


have a range of over 1,000 km, while SRINF systems have a range of between 500 and

1,000 km. Figures 18 and 19 show the numbers of LRINF and SRINF forces as they

were at the end of 1987, and include only offensive land-based systems deployed in

Europe from the Urals westward. They exclude:

aircraft and missiles based outside Europe, in the United States and in the Soviet

Union east of the Urals;

aircraft whose primary mission is maritime, such as those of the Soviet naval air

forces and NATO aircraft with an anti-ship role;

NATO sea-based nuclear systems, such as the Terrier surface-to-air missile, the

ASROC and SUBROC anti-submarine missiles, air-delivered bombs and aircraft on

US aircraft carriers;

Warsaw Pact sea-based systems, such as SS-N-3, SS-N-7, SS-N-12 and SS-N-19

anti-ship cruise missiles, nuclear depth-bombs, surface-to-air missiles, and SS-N-5

non-strategic ballistic missiles on submarines deployed in the Baltic Sea; and

air defence systems with a capability against air-breathing nuclear delivery

systems. This is an area of massive Warsaw Pact superiority; they have, for

example, almost 14,000 SAM launchers compared with NATO&apos;s total of about

2,000.

620. The INF Treaty is intended to eliminate globally all US and Soviet ground-

launched missile systems in the LRINF and SRINF categories, deployed or otherwise

(see Chapter 2). Of these, pending the treaty&apos;s implementation, 304 operational US

GLCMs are deployed in the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy

and Belgium, and 108 operational US Pershing II missiles are deployed in the Federal

Republic. A number of GLCM and Pershing II spare missile bodies will also be

eliminated. On the Soviet side there are 243 SS-20 and 65 SS-4 missiles deployed in

Europe, and 247 Scaleboard and SS-23. In addition, the Federal Republic deploys 72

Pershing 1A missiles (with US-owned warheads), which, although not covered by the

treaty, will be phased out over the same timescale.

621. It is much more difficult to compare INF aircraft numbers, but the Warsaw Pact

has far more dual-capable aircraft than does NATO. Moreover, the Warsaw Pact does

not disclose how many of its aircraft are assigned to nuclear operations; we have

SRINFAircraft. This d iagram shows all aircraft of types known to have a nuclear-capable variant. On the NATO side, the number

assigned to the nuclear role is indicated by the coloured part of the column. The other aircraft shown are not assigned to the nuclear

fole, and could not be so used. The Warsaw Pact does not disclose similar information about its own aircraft, and it is not possible to

produce reliable estimates. All Warsaw Pact aircraft of types known to be nuclear-capable are therefore shown.

Short-Rango Artillery. This diagram shows all artillery pieces of types known to have a nuclear-capable variant. On the NATO side,

&apos;Deployed launchers at 1 November 1987 according to data contained in the Memorandum of Understanding of the INFTreafy.


therefore included in Figure 19 all Warsaw Pact shorter-range aircraft of types that

could deliver nuclear weapons. Many of these aircraft are capable of carrying air-to-

surface missiles (ASMs) with ranges up to several hundred kilometres and fitted with

either conventional or nuclear warheads; and new ASMs are being developed. The

number of NATO SRINF aircraft with a nuclear role, 700, is indicated by the coloured

part of the column; the other aircraft shown, a further 800, are of similar types but are

assigned for conventional use.

Short-Range Nuclear Forces

622. Short-range nuclear forces (Figure 19) include artillery and missiles with a range

less than about 500 km and are sometimes referred to as battlefield weapons. On the

Warsaw Pact side, the more accurate SS-21 short-range ballistic missile continues to

replace Frog, and improved artillery is being deployed in greater numbers. The Warsaw

Pact also has a large number of Scud missiles in service, with a range of about 300 km.

The only short-range missile in this category assigned to NATO is Lance. As with

tactical aircraft, artillery systems may also be dual-capable and we do not know

precisely how many of the Warsaw Pact systems are intended for use in the nuclear

role. Figure 19 therefore shows all Warsaw Pact artillery that could be used in such a

role. For comparison, we also show the total number of dual-capable NATO artillery

systems and, in colour, the number that have been certified to deliver nuclear shells.

The NATO numbers are higher than those shown in last year&apos;s Statement. There are

several reasons for this. In particular, the previous total numbers were based on the

last set of figures produced by NATO, which were published in the Statement on the

Defence Estimates 1985. Since then, NATO countries have begun to substitute larger

calibre artillery, which is nuclear-capable, for smaller calibre weapons, which are not,

and we have updated our figures to reflect this. In addition, in line with the decisions

taken at Montebello in 1983 and in SACEUR&apos;s subsequent study of theatre nuclear

requirements, a higher proportion of dual-capable weapons has been certified for

nuclear use. But this does not mean that the availability of nuclear shells has

increased; as we make clear on page [ ], NATO has 2,400 fewer nuclear warheads in

Europe than in 1979.

SOVIET DEFENCE EXPENDITURE

623. The substantial improvement in Soviet military capabilities over recent years has

been made possible by the high priority given to the defence sector in the allocation of

resources.   Expenditure on defence has grown in real terms by about 50% since 1970.

CONFIDENTIAL



The share of national economic output allocated to defence, at 15% of gross national

product, far exceeds that of any NATO country.

624. Mr Gorbachev recognises that this defence burden is a major constraint on his

plans to modernise and revitalise the Soviet economy and raise living standards. He has

already made clear that he expects Soviet defence industries to operate more

efficiently and to increase their manufacture of consumer goods and machinery for

civilian industry. Given the number of new weapons now entering, or about to enter,

production, we believe that only a policy decision to trim or abandon some programmes

can prevent the burden of defence rising still further over the next few years. Except

for systems given up under the INF agreements, and despite the declared Soviet position

on other arms control issues, we have as yet seen no evidence that such policy decisions

have been taken.

CHEMICAL WARFARE

1. The Soviet Union commands the world&apos;s largest, most comprehensive and

advanced capability for chemical and toxic agent warfare (CW). This ranges from the

research, production, and storage of lethal agents and chemical weapons to the

protective systems required for their use. The Soviet Union has produced and

stockpiled a wide variety of chemical agents and munitions and has a massive tonnage

of nerve agent alone. These weapons very clearly represent a serious threat to NATO

- a threat that has increased over recent years with improvements in Soviet CW

capability.

2. The appalling and indiscriminate effects of chemical weapons have been seen in

the Gulf conflict. Less widely understood are the effects of being forced to protect

our troops against them on the battlefield.

3. British Servicemen are provided with a range of equipment to protect them

against chemical attack. Protection for the individual Serviceman includes suits and

respirators, monitoring equipment and medical aids. Where necessary and

practicable, a filtered air supply provides collective protection, for example in the

command centre of a destroyer, in the crew compartment of a tank, in portable

structures on the battlefield or in key permanent buildings such as command and

control centres. Our forces also operate detection equipment, which can monitor the

atmosphere and warn when a hazardous concentration of chemical agent is detected.

This equipment needs to be regularly updated to ensure that it remains effective

against the agents likely to be used - and the pace at which new agents can be

developed is a serious cause of concern.

4. But, despite this protection, our forces would be far less efficient when using it.

On the battlefield, the mere threat of use by an enemy would require our troops to

take defensive measures, so that they might have to fight in the equipment for very

long periods. The protective suits in particular are cumbersome, impeding movement

and vision and making the smallest task much more difficult. It is not easy to

communicate, nor to read, write, study maps or give orders. Eating and drinking are

awkward, slow and hazardous.   The immediate effect is to sap both physical and

CONFIDENTIAL


mental stamina; and experience in training suggests that the fighting capacity of

troops could be reduced by up to 50%. Resupply and repair, involving the transfer of

stores and equipment from a clean to a contaminated environment, and vice versa,

pose enormous problems of control and decontamination. Similar difficulties arise in

providing medical support; to the problems of treating casualties caused by chemical

weapons must be added the complications of chemically contaminated wounds and

injuries. Clearly such a position has far-reaching implications for NATO&apos;s ability to

undertake sustained operations. In contrast, a potential aggressor, who would know

when he intended to attack and with what kind of agent, would have the advantage of

being able to operate without protection until it was actually needed. Consequently

conventional defence would become far more difficult and, in the absence of a

credible Western chemical deterrent capability, the early use of nuclear weapons

would become more likely.

5. The United Kingdom has had no chemical weapons since the late 1950s, nor do

we plan to change that policy; our research programme is entirely dedicated to

improving the protective measures outlined above. The United States halted

production of chemical weapons in 1969, although it retained a limited retaliatory

capability. This unilateral restraint by the West has not been matched by the Soviet

Union, and only a very small proportion of the US stock is now militarily useful. In

view of the severe military disadvantages presented by the Soviet CW capability, the

United States has begun a modernisation programme to replace its own stocks with

binary weapons stationed on US territory. Binary weapons produce the same agents

as existing weapons in the US stockpile, but they are much easier and safer to store,

handle and destroy. We believe that the US modernisation programme will underline

to the Soviet Union the benefits of the negotiated ban, which we, and all NATO

members, remain committed to concluding. In the absence of such an agreement, the

US capability will help maintain the NATO strategy of deterrence through flexible

response.

2. An independent advisory group, consisting of distinguished scientists from outside

the Ministry, has monitored the planning and execution of the treatment and the

analysis of the results. On its recommendation, as a demonstration of confidence,

sheep were safely grazed on the island during the spring and summer of 1987. The

group has now endorsed our conclusion that the island can be considered safe for

agricultural use; and it will shortly be returned to its original owners, as provided for in

the terms of the transfer to the then Ministry of Supply in 1946.

DEFENCE EXPORTS

420. 1987 did not produce exports of defence equipment on the scale of the previous

year, when the first contracts for the sale of Tornado aircraft and other equipment to

Saudi Arabia - our largest ever defence order - were signed. But the general upward

trend of our sales over recent years has continued, and contracts signed in 1987 are

expected to reach  3,500 million.

421. Our defence trade with the United States has continued to grow, covering a

wide range of British products for US forces; and last year we became the United

States&apos; leading defence trading partner. Other major successes in 1987 included sales of

an Army communications system to Australia, and of Hawk aircraft to the Swiss Air

Force.

422. The Defence Export Services Organisation (DESO) continues to work closely

with British defence manufacturers, large and small alike, to help win orders in an

extremely competitive world market. Industrial and financial symposia were arranged

in 1987 to help companies formulate effective export marketing strategies. Among the

promotional activities mounted during the year, the Royal Navy Equipment Exhibition

at Portsmouth included representation from more than 300 British companies and

attracted visitors from 76 overseas countries. The biennial British Army Equipment

Exhibition will be held in 1988. These exhibitions, arranged by the DESO, are proving

increasingly successful as shop windows for British manufacturers.

423. Strict controls of defence exports are essential to prevent weapons and other

sensitive items falling into the wrong hands. These controls, involving several

Government departments, must be applied effectively, but also with sensitivity so as

not to impede unnecessarily the flow of legitimate defence business. The DESO plays

an important part in exercising these controls and in advising industry on their effect.

BRITISH PARTICIPATION IN THE SDI RESEARCH PROGRAMME

424. The SDI Participation Office (SDIPO) in the Ministry of Defence has continued

to promote British participation in this US programme under the terms of the US/UK

MOU signed in December 1985. The service provided to help British companies and

research institutions to secure SDI contracts remains the major activity of the office,

which was reinforced in 1987 by the appointment of two further specialists, one based

in Washington, the other in Los Angeles. The SDI supplement to the MOD Contracts

Bulletin (see paragraph 406) has been well received. The comprehensive exchange of

technical information between the US and British Governments, also coordinated by the

SDIPO, is developing satisfactorily.

425. By February 1988 some 65 US-funded SDI contracts and sub-contracts had been

placed in the United Kingdom to a value of $60 million. This total includes the first

substantial sub-contract secured by British industry: by Ferranti Computer Systems Ltd,

working for the Martin Marietta Aerospace Corporation on the US National Test Bed

for the SDI. It also includes encouraging successes for British higher academic research

bodies: 17 such institutions have received contracts worth $10 million. This work has

been gained in a climate of competition for SDI research work that has turned out to

be, if anything, more severe than predicted in last year&apos;s Statement.

426. The degree of interest shown by British industry in presenting proposals to the

United States continues to grow. These proposals have been innovative and of high

technical quality, but they need to be targeted with increasing precision as pressures on

the SDI budget grow and as competition intensifies. The SDIPO will continue to

contribute its best efforts to achieving this.

ESSAY

PROCUREMENT: KEEPING UP WITH THE TIMES

1. The increasing sophistication of the threat faced by our armed forces, and the

consequent growth in the real cost of equipment to meet it, have caused the Ministry of

Defence to change the emphasis of its approach to procurement in recent years. We

have adopted a more commercial attitude, exploiting the best practices to obtain long-

term value for money. And we have been working more closely with our allies to

secure greater output from our collective investment in defence procurement. Our

fundamental aim remains unchanged: to buy for the armed forces the equipment they

need to the required quality, at the right time and at the keenest price. Good

management by the Procurement Executive (PE) contributes significantly to the ability

of the British armed forces to meet our defence commitments. It also contributes to

the Government&apos;s broader policy for improving the working of the economy by making

markets operate more effectively.

2. Competition is a vital part of this strategy. As well as requiring companies to

quote keen prices, it stimulates innovative thinking and efficient use of industrial

resources. To make the defence market operate in a competitive way, we must have

the right procedures and the right staff.

The Right Procedures

3. We used to define equipment down to a very detailed level and ask industry to

develop and produce it. Today, however, industry makes a far greater contribution to

deciding how the Services&apos; requirements can best be met. Whenever possible, we

express a requirement in terms of specified criteria, such as performance and

reliability, and leave it to the contractor to decide how to meet them. This can lead, at

one extreme, to an entirely new design or, at the other, to an off-the-shelf purchase.

4. We place responsibility and risk with the contractor, providing him with the

incentive to deliver equipment at the agreed time and at the agreed price. Where

appropriate, we place package contracts for both development and production, giving a

potential contractor considerable freedom to decide how much development work will

enable him to make us the most attractive offer.


CONFIDENTIAL

5. Competition is sought wherever reasonable and practicable. Where it is not, we

aim to give contractors the greatest possible incentive to perform the work efficiently.

This means, for example, that we have moved away from contracts in which we pay the

costs incurred plus a percentage fee for profit. We also encourage as much competition

as possible among sub-contractors; on all contracts over  1 million in value, whether or

not they have been let competitively, we review with the prime contractor his plans for

competition in the award of sub-contracts.

6. We have, in addition, revised our approach to interim payments in new contracts;

we now relate such payments to actual progress being achieved. In 1986 we secured

Treasury agreement to increase the amount of underspent procurement expenditure

that can be carried forward at the end of the financial year. In addition to the existing

5% of the provision for capital expenditure, we now have up to an additional  400

million for a period of three years. This greater flexibility means that we can maintain

the financial incentive for contractors to perform efficiently, rather than working

within a rigid annual cash limit, which in the past led to the Ministry making payments

simply to reflect the passage of time rather than a contractor&apos;s performance.

7. By promoting efficiency, these policies in turn help companies to be competitive

in their exports. And we therefore take great care over the export potential of

equipment when we draw up staff targets and staff requirements.

8. The PE is also seeking to spread defence work more widely within industry. We

already have about 9,000 companies registered with us, and the newly established Small

Firms Advice Division helps small companies bid for defence work. Industry responds

better when it understands our approach and has the fullest information possible about

our requirements. Therefore:

We have published a code of practice on competition in the award of sub-

contracts, and guidelines on competitive tendering procedures and on

financing of terms for defence contracts. These have all been prepared in

consultation with industry.

We announce details of potential orders worth over  0.5 million in the

fortnightly MOD Contracts Bulletin, so that companies can compete for

business at both prime- and sub-contract level. We also use the bulletin to

help identify potential new bidders for major programmes and to encourage

suppliers to tender for work in fields new to them.


CONFIDENTIAL

We arrange regular conferences to review with industry the future require-

ments of the armed forces.

We brief unsuccessful bidders so that they know why they were not awarded

contracts.

The Defence Export Services Organisation advises companies on how to

exploit the export potential of defence equipment.

The Right Staff

9. Competition makes demands on the PE&apos;s staff as well as on companies. Staff need

to have as commercial an attitude as possible in their dealings with industry, while

maintaining, as public servants, standards of even-handedness that cannot be measured

in financial terms. We have adopted a systematic approach to career management and

training to ensure that project staff receive, through a system of linked postings and

training, the experience and knowledge they need in appropriate disciplines. We are

continuing the policy of exchanging personnel between the PE and industry and

commerce; there are now over 200 such interchanges a year, more than double the

number two years ago.

10. Engineers play a vital role in the procurement process. The Defence Engineering

Service, bringing together all the civilian engineering specialists in the Ministry of

Defence, was successfully launched last year (see paragraph 520), enabling us to make

the best use of these skilled specialists and improve their status.

11. Project managers are now clearly identified as in charge of, and responsible for,

all aspects of a project&apos;s progress. They lead an integrated multi-disciplinary team,

including finance and contracts staff. We are currently studying how best to enable the

Defence Quality Assurance organisation to devote more attention to product

specification, while retaining its responsibility for assessing and checking the quality

management systems used by contractors.

12. The PE Management Board now operates on the model of a commercial board of

directors, under the chairmanship of the Chief of Defence Procurement. Each of the

three Systems Controllers (sea, land and air) provides a monthly report on the technical

and financial progress of his projects, giving the earliest possible warning of

difficulties.


CONFIDENTIAL

The International Dimension

13. We cannot afford to develop all our defence equipment in this country. The

argument for collaboration with our allies is straightforward: better value for money

can be achieved by sharing development costs, increasing production runs and pooling

resources for logistic support. No less important are the benefits to be gained from

access to the best ideas from the best companies in partner countries. From an

Alliance-wide point of view, we do not secure the best value from the resources we put

into our collective defence (nor do we achieve full operational efficiency) if the

development and production of similar equipment are wastefully duplicated by separate

programmes in separate countries.

14. The traditional approach to collaboration, illustrated by the projects listed in

Table 5, has been the development and production of equipment by groups of countries,

or licensed production in one country of equipment designed in another. Last year&apos;s

Statement recorded our commitment to develop and produce most significant new

equipments in collaboration with allies unless there are pressing reasons not to do so -

and provided we get value for money. The last qualification is important because

collaboration is not an end in itself. There is growing acceptance of the need to

maximise the benefits of international projects by adopting arrangements to promote

efficiency. Other European nations, for example, increasingly recognise the advantages

of competitive procurement, and this is becoming a more common feature of collabora-

tive projects.

15. But we want to encourage different types of cooperation as well, since there will

be occasions when the traditional approach is not the most efficient. In the case of the

less costly projects, for example, it may make more sense for countries to agree to buy

from one another equipment that each has developed on its own. This can lead to many

of the benefits of collaborative development, with the added advantage of simplicity.

Such an approach - known as reciprocal purchase - offers the prospect of introducing

off-the-shelf equipment into service, thus eliminating or reducing duplication of

research and development, as well as creating economies in production through longer

production runs. Similar benefits can be obtained by off-the-shelf purchases from

abroad with offset arrangements.

The Benefits

16. We can already see the benefits of adopting this commercial approach to

procurement.   The examples given in paragraph 405 of recent successes in driving



CONFIDENTIAL

down costs produced savings of  105 million in the last year. And significant savings

have been achieved in previous years, for example  20 million saved on the first batch

of Upholder class submarines;  100 million on the first order of the Warrior infantry

combat vehicle; and  60 million on the RAF&apos;s basic trainer. In addition, international

cooperation is enabling us to share the cost of developing expensive new equipment with

our allies. The result is that our armed forces benefit by receiving more equipment for

the same expenditure. And British companies, as they become more competitive and

have better products to sell, are exporting more than ever; our defence exports tripled

in real terms between 1979 and 1986.

17. The task is now to build on the successes already achieved and to reinforce the

changes in practices and attitudes that have been described in this essay. We must keep

up with the times if we are to continue to provide the British armed forces with the

equipment they need within the resources available to us.

CHAPTER FIVE: MONEY AND MANAGEMENT

THE DEFENCE BUDGET

501. The defence budget for 1988-89 is  19,215 million -  433 million more than the

original Supply Estimates provision for 1987-88 and  235 million more than the

provision planned for 1988-89 in the 1987 Public Expenditure White Paper. The planned

provision for 1989-90, at  19,950 million, is also above that shown in the 1987 White

Paper, by  480 million. Provision for 1990-91 has been set at  20,560 million.

502. A breakdown of the defence budget by main areas of expenditure is shown in

Figure 11. Figure 12 analyses defence expenditure by major programmes, while

Figure 13 illustrates the cost of our main commitments. Figure 14 shows that, in

absolute terms, as a percentage of gross domestic product, and per capita, the British

defence budget continues to be among the highest in NATO.

503. Last year&apos;s Statement said that the defence budget was expected broadly to

level out in 1989-90. New plans reflected in the 1988 Public Expenditure White Paper

mean that, on current inflation forecasts, the defence budget will now benefit from a

broadly level provision between 1988-89 and the end of the present public expenditure

planning period in 1990-91. Past Statements have warned that the ending of the

commitment to maintain real growth inevitably means that difficult choices have to be

made between priorities in our forward plans; but we shall maintain our main defence

roles. The extra resources now available provide greater room for manoeuvre at the

margins of the programme, but will not avoid the need for some difficult decisions, of

the kind we face every year in the course of our usual planning cycle. This makes it all

the more important to pursue efficiency and value for money to the greatest possible

extent. Recent progress in this area is described in the following paragraphs and in

Chapter 4.

INVESTMENT IN CONVENTIONAL DEFENCE

1. Between 1979-80 and 1985-86 provision for defence grew steadily as a result of

the Government&apos;s increasing expenditure in response to the NATO target of 3% a year

real growth. This allowed a wide range of improvements to be made in the capabilities

of our armed forces. In cash terms, about 95% of the increase was devoted to our

conventional forces - some  16,000 million more than if expenditure had continued at

1978-79 rates - and this included substantial and continuing investment in equipment.

2. The product of this investment is illustrated in the following table, which sets out

major new equipment ordered since 1979. The table also shows how much of this

equipment has yet to be brought into service, illustrating that the benefits of this

investment have yet to to be felt in full.

[Table 6 (temporarily attached at the end of this chapter) will appear here.]

Value For Money

504. The Ministry of Defence has made a major contribution to the Government&apos;s

plans to reduce the size of the Civil Service. Since 1979 UK-based civilian staff

numbers have decreased by over 100,000, or 41%, to 145,000, lower than planned. Over

65% of these savings have come from our programme of efficiency measures,

rationalisation of tasks and contracting out; the remainder has resulted from the

privatisation of the Royal Ordnance Factories and the introduction of commercial

management into the Royal Dockyards. The search for further economies will continue.

505. Economies are also being made in Service manpower, particular effort being

directed towards achieving savings in support areas:

Since 1981, the proportion of Royal Navy personnel serving on the front

line or immediately in its support has increased to 70%, and the Service&apos;s

uniformed strength has been reduced by over 8,000. Less manpower-

intensive ships are also being introduced into the Fleet; for example, on

current plans the crew of a Type 23 will be two-thirds of that needed in a

Type 22.

The Army&apos;s Lean Look programme is progressing well; this aims to save

about 4,000 uniformed support posts by 1990, and about half of these had

been achieved by April 1988. The programme will enable us to improve

our front-line capability, including, for example, the reroling and

deployment to BAOR of an additional armoured regiment and the new

Starstreak air defence regiment, without any increase in total manpower.

The RAF, too, continues to search for ways to carry out its task more

efficiently; economies achieved by contracting out and transferring

Service posts to civilians have yielded savings of some 1,700 uniformed

posts in the support area since 1984, and there are plans to save as many

again over the next few years.

506. Increasing the role of the private sector in defence support tasks has the

additional advantage of introducing the benefits to be derived from competition in the

commercial market. For example, 90% of ship refitting is now undertaken

commercially, including more than 20% in the open market; about one-third of the

Army&apos;s third-line equipment repair work in the United Kingdom is undertaken by

commercial contractors; and about half of all aircraft and engine repair and overhaul

for the RAF is carried out in industry.

Financial Management

507. Improving the way in which Whitehall departments manage their resources

remains an important aim of the Government. The Financial Management Initiative

(set out in Cmnd 9058 of 1983) aims to achieve this by stressing the need for

departments to set clear objectives, to define precisely where responsibility lies for

meeting these objectives and to monitor whether they are being achieved.

508. The Ministry of Defence is playing a full part in this initiative. Recent

Statements have described the development and introduction of such new management

systems as Executive Responsibility Budgets (ERBs), which enable management to

relate all the costs attributable to a particular activity to the results produced by it;

and Staff Responsibility Budgets (SRBs), which allow managers flexibility in the

allocation of manpower. In 1987-88 the ERB arrangements were extended to further

units in the support field. And higher-level ERBs were introduced in a number of

management areas: naval supply, aircraft engineering and marine services, Army

supply and training, RAF repair and supply, and Service hospitals in the United

Kingdom. The ERB system currently covers cash expenditure amounting to some  5,000

million a year. For the future, there are firm plans for the introduction of more ERBs

at both unit and senior management level.

509. Work is continuing on the development of the new management strategy

foreshadowed in last year&apos;s Statement. The aim is to secure better value from the

Department&apos;s running costs (ie all expenditure other than major capital expenditure) by

more closely aligning responsibility for both financial and line management. The

CONFIDENTIAL

emphasis is on centralised resource allocation, greater managerial freedom within the

approved budgets and accountability to higher management. The new strategy has two

main elements:

A more comprehensive budgetary regime, which will not only subsume

existing ERBs and SRBs but also include all the Department&apos;s running

costs, both in the operational and support areas; and

A management information system (TOPMIS), which will replace MINIS

and will serve the needs of the Financial Planning and Management Group

(in its role as the Ministry&apos;s Top Management Group), the Service

Executive Committees and the Procurement Executive Management

Board, providing them with a vehicle for setting objectives and targets

and undertaking an annual review of performance.

The Next Steps&apos;.

510. In February, the Government announced its response to the recommendations in

Sir Robin Ibbs&apos; report on Improving Management in Government - The Next Steps. This

accepted the report&apos;s recommendation that, to the greatest possible extent, the

executive functions of government should be delegated to agencies each headed by a

chief executive working within a policy and resources framework set by the responsible

Minister. The Ministry of Defence is considering two candidates for possible agency

status: the group of six non-nuclear research establishments (see paragraph 418) and the

Meteorological Office (see paragraphs 530-532). The identification of further potential

candidates will depend on the experience gained in working up these initial proposals.

511. The Ministry&apos;s aim for the non-nuclear research establishments is to devise a

framework of clear and precise aims, within which the management can operate with

greater efficiency and which will allow greater flexibility to exploit the considerable

intellectual and physical asset of these establishments. This is currently the subject of

a feasibility study. In the case of the Meteorological Office, the proposal is an

extension of the existing policy of developing greater managerial responsibility and

increasing commercial independence. Much planning remains to be done, but the aim is

to achieve agency status for the Meteorological Office in 1990. The Trade Unions have

been informed of these proposals and assured that they will be fully consulted.

PERSONNEL

The Services

512. The manning position in the armed forces is broadly satisfactory, although there

are shortfalls in certain areas. The Services face stiff competition from civilian

employers, especially in those areas where there are national shortages of well qualified

and able staff. Nevertheless, recruitment has reached 99% of the targets for both

officers and other ranks; shortfalls in officer recruitment have been in specialist areas,

for example medical officers.

513. Competition with the private sector is likely to increase over the next few

years as demographic trends lead to fewer young people being available for

employment, while the expansion of the economy increases the number of jobs

available. To help forestall this difficulty the Services are seeking to retain trained

manpower for longer periods. This has the added benefits of ensuring a better return on

our investment in training those retained, of reducing pressures on training

organisations, and of making more trained and experienced manpower available for

front-line tasks.

514. At December 1987, the annual rates of applications for premature voluntary

retirement were some 3.63% of the trained strength for officers and 3.04% for other

ranks. The proportion of those who actually left was running at annual rates of 3.13%

for officers and 2.71% for other ranks. Current levels are fairly stable and compare

favourably with previous years; but some concern remains.

515. The Government has ensured that Service pay has been kept broadly at a

competitive level. The wide-ranging review of the armed forces&apos; allowances, mentioned

in last year&apos;s Statement, will ensure that they remain adequate and appropriate to the

operational needs of each of the three Services.

516. Over the past year there has been wide publicity and understandable public

concern about a series of incidents and allegations of bullying, ill-treatment and

initiation ceremonies in the Army. This concern has been shared by Ministers and the

Army Command at all levels; bullying and humiliating practices form no part of Service

life, and are not tolerated. All soldiers are briefed on, and regularly reminded of, their

right to make a complaint if they believe they have reason. They are further made

aware of the procedures for so doing, including direct access to their commanding

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

officers, and of the help available from unit families&apos; and medical officers, padres and

members of the Women&apos;s Royal Voluntary Service. All complaints are thoroughly

investigated, and prompt disciplinary action is taken if they are substantiated.

517. Of some 120 cases reported and investigated between January 1986 and April

1988, the allegations in half have been found to be groundless. Investigations continue

in 15 cases. Allegations in 45 cases, some of them serious, have been substantiated;

they have been, or are being, dealt with by appropriate disciplinary action, including in

certain cases imprisonment and dismissal from the Army. The available evidence does

not show a rising trend in the incidence of bullying or ill-treatment of soldiers, nor does

it support the view that this is a general or deep-seated problem. But the Army is

certainly not complacent. Following a very full examination by Commanders-in-Chief,

the Government outlined, in January 1988, a series of further measures to eradicate

bullying. The measures include better supervision in training depots; more emphasis on

man-management and the responsibilities of officers and NCOs to their men; a further

examination of selection procedures for both recruits and NCO instructors at training

depots; better use of volunteers who work with the Army; and the formal banning of all

harmful initiation ceremonies.

Civilians

518. The Department continues to experience problems in recruiting and retaining

civilian staff at many levels and in a variety of fields, including high quality

administrators and specialists such as electronics engineers, staff trained in automatic

data processing (ADP), and management accountants. There are also acute shortages

of clerical and secretarial staff, especially in London and the south east; and problems

in recruiting and retaining certain industrial grades, particularly craftsmen.

519. A number of initiatives has been taken to improve matters, including:

A new flexible pay agreement covering 25,000 specialist staff, to give

management more scope in tackling problems of recruitment and

retention;

incentive pay arrangements across the Civil Service to link the pay of

senior grades to performance;

the introduction of a new fast stream for high quality recruits to the

defence science group, offering   individual career development, training

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

and accelerated promotion prospects similar to those enjoyed by fast-

stream administrators and engineers;

the adoption of short-service contracts to attract additional specialists

with specific skills and experience;

a new, more dynamic, recruitment strategy, aimed at graduate scientists

and engineers, which includes better advertising and recruitment

literature, and visits to universities and career conventions;

higher allowances for ADP and management accountancy staff;

in the support grades, a drive to improve recruitment; employment of

agency secretarial staff, clerks and typists; moving work out of London;

and consideration of proposals to introduce local pay additions for staff in

the hardest hit areas; and

for industrial grades, consideration of measures to relate pay more closely

to the local market rate.

520. The Defence Engineering Service (DES) was launched successfully last year, when

the first young engineers were recruited to the new fast stream. We are looking to

build on this initial success by expanding the fast-stream entry to cover the sea systems

area, by improving career development, training, and promotion arrangements, and by

expanding our sponsorship of students reading for engineering degrees.

SUPPORT SERVICES

Defence Medical Services

521. We are pressing on with our efforts to get value for money in the provision of

medical services. Contracts for dental technical work have now been placed at a saving

of  125,000 a year. In the Falkland Islands, the temporary British Military Hospital at

the Canache has been closed and we are using the recently opened King Edward VII

Memorial Hospital at Stanley, sharing the cost with the Falkland Islands Government.

The direct supply of drugs from manufacturers to Service hospitals and other defence

medical establishments remains under consideration. The potential benefits, including

faster delivery and cheaper storage and distribution, are having to be measured against

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

a continuing need to stockpile and distribute drugs for operational purposes, where

direct supply would not adequately meet our requirements.

522. To help reduce waiting lists at National Health Service (NHS) hospitals, we have

reached an agreement this year with the Department of Health and Social Security that

will enable local health authorities to make greater use of Service hospitals. Each year

these hospitals treat, free of charge, 34,000 in-patients, 200,000 out-patients and 4,000

day patients referred to them by NHS general practitioners. The new agreement will

enable additional patients to be treated against payment to the Ministry of Defence

from Department of Health and Social Security funds.

DEFENCE STATISTICS

1. Thirty-five members of the Government Statistical Service work in the Ministry

of Defence, using their mathematical and data management skills to organise and

interpret a wide range of information. For example, the Ministry&apos;s half million men and

women are employed in a wide variety of jobs and locations, and are constantly on the

move. Statistical expertise helps to monitor, report and forecast strengths by area and

role so that manning levels can be planned and controlled.

2. A number of organisations provide support for the front-line troops, and the

Financial Management Initiative (see paragraph 507) calls for measurement not only of

the cost but also of the volume and quality of the services provided. During 1987-88

our statisticians have been developing new output measures to assist this process.

3. Developing new weapons systems at the forefront of technology can pose

problems for management, since both costs and development timescales are potentially

at risk. Statisticians provide defence planners with practical methods for assessing

these variables, thus enabling decisions to be made on the level of risk involved in any

new project.

4. The statisticians&apos; other activities include economic and logistic forecasting, and

surveying pay and conditions and hours worked. They also prepare the second volume of

this publication, which provides a comprehensive breakdown of trends in defence

expenditure and resources.

Public Relations

523. The highlight of the year for public relations was the Prime Minister&apos;s meeting

with Mr Gorbachev at RAF Brize Norton in December 1987, when the Defence Public

Relations Staff provided facilities for 578 media representatives from around the world.

As the INF negotiations progressed, they also arranged for the press to visit RAF

Molesworth for the first time, and organised three further visits to RAF Greenham

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

Common; and they provided briefings on the arrangements for verifying implementation

of the INF Agreement.

524. Facilities were provided for six press visits to the Royal Navy&apos;s ARMILLA

patrol; and in September 1987 the press were able to watch the progress of the four

MCMVs on their way to the Gulf to support the patrol. Journalists were invited to all

the major exercises of the year including PURPLE WARRIOR, where the presence, for

the first time, of the Warsaw Pact observers in the United Kingdom attracted

particular interest. Exercise KEYSTONE also received wide media coverage, both in the

United Kingdom and in the Federal Republic of Germany. For the third year we have

published, for free distribution, a booklet accompanying this Statement and designed to

explain British defence policy to a wider audience.

The Defence Estate

525. The Ministry of Defence continues to review its land holdings regularly, to

identify and dispose of surplus land. The estate is still getting smaller, despite the

acquisition of additional land essential for the Army&apos;s training needs. In the future we

expect the size of the estate to stabilise, further acquisitions of relatively low-value

training land being offset by disposal of high-value land where efficiency and

operational needs allow. We are, for example, working to rationalise our land holdings

in high-value areas such as north-west London. Receipts from the sale of surplus land

and buildings in 1986-87 were  75 million, compared with a target of  64 million, and in

1987-88 receipts of well over  70 million are expected (again against a target of  64

million).

526. In common with the whole of southern England, the defence estate suffered

great damage to both buildings and trees as a result of last October&apos;s gales; and the

subsequent flooding in the west country did yet more damage. The total cost to

Defence votes, including building repairs, replacement of trees and loss of revenue, is

estimated at  8.6 million. Planting programmes over the next few years will include

the replacement of trees lost in the storm.

527. As part of our contribution to the European Year of the Environment (EYE), we

published a brochure entitled Defence and the Environment, describing the varied

conservation activities of the Services across the defence estate. Two of the main aims

of EYE were conservation of the countryside and improvement of the urban

environment. In pursuit of the first aim, conservation groups in defence establishments,

with the help of the Property Services Agency, undertook special projects such as

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL

creating wetland, clearing scrub and planting hedgerows. Many thousands of trees were

also planted, including, in one instance, a whole wood of native broad-leaf trees.

Keeping the defence estate tidy is part of routine estate management, but a special

effort has been made to clean up litter and remove eyesores.

528. We also welcomed the opportunity to participate in the Countryside Commis-

sion&apos;s National Parks Awareness Campaign in 1987 and we drew up a Declaration of

Commitment to National Parks, in which we undertook to promote the aims of the park

authorities, taking account of our essential defence needs. And we concluded a

Declaration of Intent with the Nature Conservancy Council, designed to strengthen our

already close relationship and to facilitate notification of Sites of Special Scientific

Interest, of which the Ministry of Defence manages a large number.

529. There are over 500 listed historic buildings on the defence estate, and we take

our responsibility for them seriously. Problems can occur when we no longer have a use

for them. We have, therefore, established an informal advisory group, the Historic

Military Buildings Committee, including experts from both the private and public

sectors, to consider imaginative and sympathetic ways of using or disposing of historic

buildings that are no longer required. Trust bodies, funded by Government endowments,

have also been set up to maintain the fabric of historic buildings at the former Chatham

dockyard and the Heritage Area in Portsmouth naval base.

The Meteorological Office

530. The Meteorological Office applies nearly half its resources to meet the

requirements of the armed forces; and, as the national meteorological service, it

provides free weather forecasts to the public. Last year&apos;s Statement described the

range of services also provided on repayment to local authorities, industry and

commerce (including civil aviation, which accounts for about a quarter of the Office&apos;s

work). Further repayment services introduced during the last year include an

automated weather forecasting service for the oil industry, particularly in the North

Sea, and a separate marketing unit set up as a profit centre within the London Weather

Centre to cater for the particular needs of the retail trade, including supermarkets and

large stores. Receipts from these and similar repayment services totalled  23.6 million

in 1986-87, of which  17.4 million was earned from services to civil aviation.

531. Warnings of the severe storm over southern and eastern England on the night of

15-16 October were issued to many specialist users of the Office&apos;s meteorological

services (including the armed forces and the offshore oil industry) some hours before

CONFIDENTIAL&apos;


CONFIDENTIAL

the storm. There was, however, much criticism of the adequacy of the warning given to

the general public, and of the accuracy of the forecasting involved.

532. Sir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer, Chairman of the University Grants Committee, and

Professor Pearce of Reading University were appointed to consider the internal report

on this event carried out by the Director General of the Meteorological Office. They

concluded that the warning was inadequate because uncertainty about atmospheric

conditions in the Biscay area led to conflicting computer forecasts, and because it was

not recognised that these forecasts would underestimate wind speeds over the United

Kingdom. But no individual was seriously to blame for this. They recommended

improvements in training forecasters, the use of more senior staff for forecasting,

improved computer and associated facilities, and changes both in working methods and

in the presentation of forecasts by the media. They also endorsed the findings and

recommendations of the Director General&apos;s report, which dealt in particular with the

need for more and better observations, for improved computer models and for a review

of procedures for sending warnings of severe weather to emergency authorities. The

recommendations of both reports have been accepted and will be implemented as soon

as possible.

The Ministry of Defence Police

533. The changes in management and organisation of the Ministry of Defence Police

(MDP), reported in last year&apos;s Statement, have been taken a stage further. In April, the

MDP Headquarters was reorganised along functional lines, separate branches being

responsible for operations, support, and personnel and training. The Chief Constable

has been given budgetary responsibilities for many of the costs of his Force, and the

secretariat has been strengthened to assist with the management of these tasks. These

changes are aimed at providing a better and more cost-effective service to the

Department and other organisations that benefit from the MDP&apos;s services.
