\\.    Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council

BACKGROUND AND PROPOSED PROGRAMME

The LegislativivProgxamme for the present Session is universally

recognised to be  yfe~ptf the very heaviest on record.    One result of

this is that althstatfJZfrtye Session began in mid-summer it will also need

to run unusually la^^^ptobably later than any Session since 1979. The

best estimate is that/tAjM^ will thus be about six weeks less sitting

time before Christmas {J^xS^&amp;ession than we have had in the present one.

Next Session&apos;s Legislative^Ppogramme will therefore be under very heavy

pressure right from the  Ck^C\\

2. Nevertheless we have a ^&gt;^a^deal more vigorous and controversial

legislation to enact and,  forovarjybus reasons, much of it must not be

postponed beyond next Session.v^W^&gt;articular, we must clearly legislate

on two massive privatisation mea/ mey\(water and electricity) and this

Session&apos;s Housing Bill was approv&amp;d^6iK he basis that another long Bill

on local authority housing finance aijjp^aoital controls would be needed

next Session.    As presently predicte&amp;^*rt&gt;se three measures alone will

total some 460 clauses. &lt;/

3. The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee (QL) have now

been through the usual process of seeking bids and having discussions

with the Ministers concerned.    The Programme they now recommend to the

Cabinet is set out at Annex A.    It contains 29/^^is of which 16 are of

medium length or greater.    Disregarding the B^flsVarried over or

reintroduced from the previous Parliament, th iV-^^Ttffe same number of

medium or longer riills as Cabinet approved last 3&amp;iykj*  the present

Session.    Many of the Bills are also highly contro^^ial.

4. While I believe that QL have judged the politica^^we correctly,

I must emphasise that the Programme they are putting forw^^is at the

outermost limits of what can be competently prepared andC^tt^rcssfully

carried through Parliament.    It contains absolutely no maxxiJ^/E^r

additions of any size.    And it will be manifest to any knowpelfo^ble

observer that such a weighty Programme will demand yet anothVr^tfflg

spillover, on top of the pressures at the end of the present 5 8^p*}.


5. In submitting this Programme to the Cabinet, therefore, I must ask

colleagues to accept that the whole Programme would be prejudiced if any

/y\ significant additions were made without compensating reductions. It

^Y^yould be helpful if colleagues seeking the addition of any measures

/OsAw^ild indicate the ones that they suggest should be deleted to make the

&gt;\ jjMJ^essary room.

$  ^0T RECOMMENDED FOR INCLUSION

6. JpteBills that QL decided not to include in the recommended

Progi^fiwflf/are set out in Annex B.    They include a number of measures for

which tt^e^^is a good political case and which have been left out only

because ^irfthe pressure on the Programme.    In particular, Cabinet

colleagues should be aware of the special arguments pointing to

legislation next Session that have been put to QL in respect of the

following topics.

a. Stu(rentjjjupport.    Our General Election Manifesto noted that

we had beg&quot;u&quot;nYa&apos;_r^|view of student support arrangements, including

the possibilV^tyowK top-up loans, and promised that &quot;we will take

care to ensure^^Pjjk^-the best aspects of the present system are

retained in any n w^roposals that we bring forward&quot;.    The review

is now near conurfeMo^ and the Secretary of State for Education

and Science and the JJHapcellor of the Exchequer believe that the

next Session represwK^yhe only politically feasible window for

legislation on the ma^L^pOin the present Parliament. The

difficulty facing QL, qpv&amp; p, is that the policy on this matter

has not yet been collecttve^^ considered.   Though a Bill on the

subject might not be very^oVg^ it could well consume a good deal

of Parliamentary time.    QL rtpro^tot think that it would be

reasonable to make the necess^y^*oom for it by deleting from the

recommended Programme a Bill thar^already has policy approval.

b. The Crown Agents.    The GoveSKraprtt has been committed to the

privatisation of the Crown Agents^^nce 1984. The Foreign and

Commonwealth Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer believe

that after such a long delay privatisation will cease to be a

realistic option after next Session.    It was put to QL that if the

opportunity is not seized, then there will^s^ill have to be

legislation in a later Session to implement s^me less satisfactory

and more expensive solution.    But, while rh^^Tvl is not one of the

more controversial privatisation proposals,Ut^wculd be yet another

medium length Bill in a Programme that alreaayp^MyAudes two massive

privatisation measures.

c. London Bus Deregulation.    We are publicly comnn^^d to

extending bus deregulation to London and we have ixi&amp;x&amp;ted that it

should take place by the early 1990s.    The SecretaryN^f^^ate for

Transport believes that if a Bill is not enacted nextSJre^An, then

deregulation would not be practicable until well into Pwr^wliich

would rule it out for this Parliament.    In recognition ot^atyy

pressures on the Programme, the Secretary of State for Trarysjporvv

has agreed not to press the inclusion of other public transpcjP^^^


measures to which he attaches priority.    But, even so, the London

^ bus deregulation provisions would amount to a Bill of substantial

/\ length and controversial content.

d. Human Fertilisation and Embryology.   This Bill is not

(?&quot;\v    controversial in party terms but it will arouse strong individual

\$ Syf/ views.   The preparations for it have now been very carefully laid,

v&apos;y^^^owever, and it was strongly argued to QL that the issue will

^Become increasingly difficult to handle if it is not settled in the

^seejpnd Session of the Parliament.    There would also be a continual

^^Jfc^of private Members&apos; Bills until Government legisation was

C5\Xj^Muced.    On the other hand, this Bill (which would probably

haM^Ji be introduced in the Commons) would take a good deal of

Parliamentary time, especially in the House of Lords.    QL also had

to consider whether it would be right to include in the same

Programme two major Department of Health and Social Security

Bills - Humajr Fertilisation etc; and Children and Family Services -

that were/froT\^f a party political nature.    The Committee concluded

that the P^Qfiramme could only bear one such measure and, for next

Session, the//puV)a higher priority on the Children and Family

Services Bili^o^%

e. Elections Iw^Kera Ireland).    QL see no difficulty in

recommending a sh&apos;^r^N^O-controversial Bill to extend the franchise

in Northern Ireland elections to the &quot;I&quot; voters.   On the

other hand, they bePt^ejnhat the proposed candidates&apos; declarations

abjuring support for p}gg&amp; ibed organisations and acts of terrorism

carry the risk of consu^ftn&amp;Nbuch Parliamentary time.    The Committee

do not, therefore, recomBfen# tfhe inclusion of that item, though

this would mean that the &amp;cMpi &amp;Lions could not be put in place

before the Northern Ir el an dC&amp;o&apos;cMS. government elections in May 1989.

ADVANCE DRAFTING AUTHORITY &lt;/^-N

7. In recent years it has been found Xre^&amp;l to give advance drafting

authority to a few very complex and lon^ffiills of cardinal political

importance that are likely to be needed Mr the Session after the one

under consideration.    Nothing of that nature has emerged in QL&apos;s work

this year, however, and I do not recommend that we should lower the

criteria in order to give advance drafting authw&apos;tvy to any of the Bills

that we can already identify as candidates f or \xhe ^-S 9-90 Session.

PREPARATION AND HANDLING OF BILLS X^^O

8. It is usual at this time to invite departmental Mra^Xers to do all

they can to ensure the timely preparation of Bills for^hA.c&apos;o they are

responsible.   This request is clearly of special importance^kis year,

when there will be less Parliamentary time than usual at^K^snart of

the Session.    It is crucially important that all the large\Bi&gt;pB&apos;\

introduced in the House of Commons should be introduced in t^eAr^ get

their Second Reading by Christmas. yC)


9.     The successful management of the programme will also depend on a

reasonable number of weighty Bills being introduced early in the Session

^in the House of Lords.    The Lord Privy Seal and I will look to

jVol leagues to co-operate with us in making these choices.

b. \\To endorse the comments about the preparation and

handling of Bills in paragraphs 8 and 9 above.
