and would vary widely.    Soja^rturses would get increases of up to about 60

per cent.    The report mencrorfsYthe possibility that a handful could suffer

a small pay cut of 1.9 per TQyU^frut management action could be taken to

ensure that no nurse got less^TttaiV a 4 per cent increase.

PROPOSALS &lt;^^^\

4. Ministers directly concerned l^we^feynsidered what the response of the

Government should be to the Review Bo^yj^ports, and have reached the

following conclusions and recommendat^Kf^f for consideration by the

Cabinet.

5. The recommendations of the Review Bowy on Nurses, Midwives and Health

Visitors should be accepted in full, on the basis described in

paragraph 3.    The recommendations of the Review Bodies on the Professions

allied to Medicine, Doctors and Dentists and Ayrae^yForces should be

accepted in full with effect from 1 April.

6. As to financing,  the cost of the awards to tRja-^JftSftgroups in excess

of the provision already made should be met from th^Kiejj^rve.    This means

providing an extra  749 million in total:     683 millim y&amp;jld ^e added to

health authority cash limits and  66 million to the pr^wi^Mn for the

Family Practitioner Services.    Allowing also for the incr^^e* already

announced,  it is now estimated that NHS provision for ^o^&amp;yNyould exceed

that for 1987-88 by  1,953 million.


7.      The Treasury propose that the pay of clinical academics should be

settled in line with the Doctors and Dentists Review Body report,  and that

,   the extra cost of between  3 million and  4 million should be a claim on

|Xthe Reserve for 1988-89.    This would be announced by the Department of

/^Education and Science as soon as possible, probably on 22 April.

The cost of the Armed Forces award should be met from within current

NXpwjy&apos;ision for this year.

9. /^lCS\to the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) groups, Ministers have had

regac^/fooay negotiations for the rest of the Civil Service.    No single

figure/ir /&apos;Deing applied across the Service this year but the common

f eatun &lt; w^ll negotiations, other than for the support grades,  is an

increaseNtSr^f&gt;per cent on existing rates from 1 April.    Some groups in the

Civil Service will receive further increases later in the year, but

Ministers concluded that to pay TSRB groups increases in excess of 4 per

cent from 1 April would undermine the Government&apos;s stance in the Civil

Service pay negotiations.    They therefore reached the view that the TSRB

award should be s/Ca^id with all the groups concerned being paid an extra

4 per cent from l(Apvil and the remainder of the award from 1 October.

The cost of the TsRJE^iTwreases would be met from current provision.

10. Ministers also EMaWit that it should be right to accept the TSRB

recommendations that NorJcxplsn Ireland County Court judges should be paid

as if they were in Grouj &gt;^?a^ther than Group 6 so long as they are

required to do significantr^-^tfferent work from that of their

counterparts elsewhere in wJ^uroLted Kingdom.    The additional cost would

be about  108,000 and add oVS^raj^cent to the judicial pay bill.

Draft Question

To ask the Prime Minister when she expects to make a statement on

the latest reports of the pay review bodies.

Draft Reply

The 1988 reports of the Review Bodies on the pay of Nursing Staff,

Midwives and Health Visitors,  and Professions Allied to Medicine,

the Doctors and Dentists, and the Armed Forces, and of the Top

Salaries Review Body, have been published today.    Copies are now

available in the Vote Office.    The Government are grateful to

members of the review bodies for these reports and the time and

care which they have put into their preparation.

The following table shows the increases in pay rates recommended

by the review bodies, and their cost:

Nurses, midwives and , ~&gt;

(1) UK public expenditure cost including employers&apos; national

insurance and superannuation contributions, where appropriate.

Figures include cost of additional payments to staff working in

the London area, where appropriate.

(2) The recommendations include implementation of a new clinical

grading structure.    Most increases fall within the range shown.

Increases could be up to 60 per cent for some nurses.    No nurses

will receive less than 4 per cent.

(3) Most increases fall within the range shown, although in six

cases the increase will be 23.7 per cent. The upper end of the

range reflects structural changes for certain groups.

rnvrTntvTTw   _ r\m


The increases recommended for nursing staff, midwives and health

visitors include implementation in the Autumn of a radical new

grading structure to provide more attractive career prospects and

proper recognition of qualifications,  skills and responsibilities

for staff directly involved in patient care.    The Review Body&apos;s

recommendations are on the basis that there should be an immediate

interim payment of 4 per cent from 1 April 1988 and that once the new

structure has been introduced, consequential pay increases would be

backdated to 1 April.

The Government have decided to accept in full the Review Body&apos;s

recommendations on nursing staff, midwives and health visitors.

They have also decided that the increases recommended by the

Review Bodies on the pay of Professions Allied to Medicine,

Doctors and Dentists and the Armed Forces should be paid in full

from 1 April 1988.    The recommendations of the Top Salaries Review

Body will be implemented as to 4 per cent from 1 April 1988, with

the balance from 1 October 1988.

The full cost   of the awards for the Armed Forces Pay Review Body

and Top Salaries Review Body groups will be met from within

existing public expenditure programme totals for this year. In

the case of the health services the Government recognise that this

could not be done without adversely affecting services to patients.

They have therefore decided that the cost for the health service

groups in excess of the allocation already made for this year

should be met from the Reserve.    They will provide an extra  749 million

from the Reserve within the planned total of public expenditure for

this year, of which  683 million will be added to health authority

cash limits.    The remaining  66 million is for the Family

Practitioner Services.    Together with the increases in allocation

already announced, the increase in provision for the National Health

Service in 1988-89 over 1987-88 will therefore be  1,953 million.

The pay rates and scales resulting from the decisions will be

promulgated as soon as possible for all the groups concerned.

Pensions will be based on the salaries actually in payment in

accordance with the principle set out in my Written Answer of

13 April 1984,  at column 383.
