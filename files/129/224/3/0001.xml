ECONOMIC STRATEGY

 m% Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer

Eight years^Q^^dy and cautious financial policies have put the British

economy in thaKtiBngest position we have enjoyed for many years.

Provided that ^^ ^%k to those policies, we shall be well placed to

withstand any sh^kjphich may lie ahead,  particularly overseas, and

should continue a healthy growth rate with low inflation.

2. All in all,  198^waJfca successful year for the British economy. The

growth rate could well^Krn out to be a shade over 4 per cent, compared

with the Budget forecast of 3 per cent.    Unemployment fell by over half a

million.    Manufacturing productivity grew by over 6i per cent. And,

unlike in earlier periods of rapid growth,  there was no resurgence of

inflation.

3. Looked at in a longer terifl^pjr^kective,  the performance of the

economy also shows up well.    It i^^^^L simply a matter of doing better

than in the 1970s:    it would have^^Mp^ppalling if we had not. But

output in recent years has grown fasKr^han the average rate in the 1950s

and the 1960s; we have brought inflacfcfcn^hack to its average level in the

1950s and 1960s; and manufacturing prd^K^wity has grown at over 4i per

cent a year, compared with less than 3i^^5Aent in the 1950s and 1960s.

4. These achievements reflect the steady^ran^ormation which is taking

place in the efficiency, enterprise and adap ^rV.ty of all sectors of the

economy.    Our financial policies have given the private sector the room

and the confidence to expand.    And our supply-side policies have reduced

the barriers which held British industry in check for far too long.    It is

clearly vital that we stick to the policies that have brought about this

success.

ECONOMIC PROSPECTS ^SfjW

5. This  is especially true against a world background twj^^ iains

uncertain.    Very large trade imbalances persist, especiallj^^ew en the

United States, Germany and Japan.    And while we have recentl] ^ 

somewhat more stable conditions in financial markets around the world, the

dollar remains volatile and confidence in equity markets is fraflf^^^


6.      World growth in 1987 was close to what I forecast in the Budget last

l    year.    The Gross National Product (GNP) of the major seven industrial

% countries probably rose by 3 per cent.    And industrial production in the

^^G7 accelerated during the year as net exports to the rest of the world

fl^mproved.    World trade in manufactures appears to have risen by 5 per

^^ce% , somewhat above the rate in the previous two years.

^T.     The latest indicators suggest that world activity remains fairly

buoyant, particularly in Japan,  the United Kingdom and (for the most part)

the United States.    But the Stock Market collapse is likely to dampen

demand in the United States, and growth in Germany remains sluggish. We

are likely^^) see GNP growth in the G7 slow down to perhaps 2\ per cent in

1988, alAKlh it could be less  than that, particularly if there is

further ^J^^fcility in world equity and foreign exchange markets.

8. Nevert^Sj|^ we should see continued healthy growth in United

Kingdom expor^i* 1988,  though probably not as high as in 1987, when our

non-oil expor t^^^fl^by 7 per cent.

9. So far as Un^^^Wtingdom domestic demand is concerned, we should see

a further strong rJ^e^^^investment growth;  this is confirmed by the

various surveys of Ws^J^s confidence and intentions carried out since

the Stock Market coll^^e^.n October, which continue to indicate buoyant

investment plans.    Consumers&apos; expenditure should grow a little less

strongly in 1988, as the savings ratio picks up from its historically very

low level in 1987.

10. With a steady growth of 4ftC%^c demand and further strong growth in

exports,  I now expect 3 per ceway^th in 1988 for the economy as a

whole.    As North Sea production will be falling, this implies non-oil

Gross Domestic Product  (GDP) growl^^^round 3i per cent.    This should be

sufficient to ensure a further f all^Kn^nemployment,  though probably not

at the rapid rate of the last 12 mon\|^^^rhe prospects for a further fall

in unemployment would clearly be bett^^^Apay settlements were more

modest. f^JL

11. The deficit on the current account o^ThAbalance of payments in 1987

is now estimated at  2.7 billion - broadly i^^ie with the  2i billion

deficit I forecast at the time of last year^ Budget.    With United Kingdom

growth in 1988 once again exceeding that of the other major economies, and

our surplus on oil trade falling as North Sea oil output falls, a higher

current acount deficit is likely in 1988.    At about 1 per cent of GDP, or

a little less, it will be very much lower than the tr^^ imbalances

elsewhere, and we should have no difficulty in finaiwmiPit.    But it is a

factor pointing in the direction of a cautious polic^H Ke.

12. Inflation as measured by the Retail Price Index crSW^^^to just

under 4i per cent in the third quarter of last year, but Isfuce fallen

back to under 3i per cent.    These fluctuations largely mirr^|^^uctuations

in the mortgage rate,  and the prospect is  that the in f lat ionJB^should

stay at around 4 per cent during 1988. ^4^^^


13. Our recent record of sustained low inflation is impressive when

compared with the United Kingdom&apos;s earlier experience at times of rapid

L growth.    But many of our major competitors have still lower inflation

grates, and we must continue to give the highest priority to getting our

Jfcaflation rate down further during the course of this Parliament.

PROSPECTS

14. Last year I introduced a cautious Budget which, despite a cut of 2p

in the basic rate of income tax, was expected to produce a Public Sector

Borrowing Requirement  (PSBR) inclusive of privatisation proceeds of just

under  4 b^^^ion (1 per cent of GDP), somewhat less than had been

previous Jta^^fc/isaged.    In the event,  the public finances  in the current

financia  )a^^are turning out to be considerably stronger than I

expected.  ^PGw seems likely that the PSBR will be negative - ie there

will be a Bufcrag^^urplus - for the first time since 1969-70.

15. The major reason for the improvement in public finances has been a

faster growth iriW  evenues than we had foreseen.    This has meant that,

despite the tax rdJKuMbons in the Budget,  the share of non-North Sea taxes

in GDP has increase^^%^^ fact,  the tax burden has now risen in each of

the last two years,  ld^Jk nearly 4 percentage points higher than it was

16. I am convinced that we must continue to follow a cautious fiscal

policy.    With the uncertainties ahead - and with United Kingdom demand

remaining buoyant at a time when^^rowth elsewhere is sluggish - this means

that we should aim for a PSBR ue^^below the level envisaged in the Medium

Term Financial Strategy:   indeeo^J(^fclieve I should budget  for a modest

surplus.

17. But even on this basis  there s ul be some scope to lower tax rates

again this year.    Indeed,  unless we ^J^^kfiscal drag will ensure that

the non-North Sea tax burden rises yet^KA next year.    But there are

clearly limits to how much can be done v^TCAetill maintaining the sound

financial policies which have been the cc^BJr^one of our success.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

18. Output growth last year was well above the 3 per cent average we have

enjoyed since 1981, but is likely to be closer to that average this year.

This will still be well above the growth rate in most other major

countries.    Unemployment  is likely to continue to fal1 ^^.though more

slowly than in 1987.    Inflation should remain steady   Pout 4 per cent.

19. But there are considerable risks and uncertainties^^^pgcially on the

international front.    We must therefore once again play n&apos;^^o ensure

that  in the coming year,  as  in the past,  we are buttressed^^^aund and

strong public  finances.    That means that tax reductions must^^jwmited to

a scale that enables us to secure a further year of Budget sur ^^^


20.    As in previous years, I would welcome colleagues&apos; views on the Budget

L   against the background of the fiscal and economic prospect I have

^^outlined.

ANNEX 2: DIRECT EFFECTS OF TAX CHANGES

  A.     Direct Taxes; Indexation

The RPI increased in the year to December 1987 by 3.7 per cent.

I With indexation by this amount and statutory rounding, the figures

I for the main allowances and other thresholds would be:

I Personal allowances 1987-88 1988-89

1 Single and wife&apos;s earned income allowance       2,425 2,515

Married allowance 3,795 3,945

Bands, eg:

129% rate 0-17,900 0-18,600

160% rate over 41,200 over 42,800

1 The total revenue costs of indexation of income tax (included in the

1 forecast) are  840 million in 1988-89 and  1,370 million in 1989-90.

IB.     Indirect Taxes; Indexation

The effects of 3.7 per cent revalorisation of the excise duties

(including VAT effects) are as follows:

VAT inclusive price change Yield in RPI impact

ANNEX 3: PUBLIC FINANCES AND THE TAX BURDEN

Taxation, Expenditure and Borrowing

Since the Government first took office, total   taxes and NICs

, have   risen by over 4 percentage points of GDP, though the ratio has

fallen from its peak in 1981-82.    This has enabled us   to secure a

i substantial reduction in public borrowing.

Personal Taxation

2. Despite reductions in income tax, total personal taxes (direct

and indirect, including employees&apos; NICs and domestic rates) in

1987-88 are about  24 billion higher in real terms (ie 1987-88

prices) than they were in 1978-79. For income tax and national

insurance contributions the following table shows how the proportion

of gross pay they represent rose up to 1981-82, particularly for the

low paid:

*Adult male earnings (all occupations).    Married couple, wife

not working: the couple are assumed to have no children, to

avoid distortion of the figures from the abolition of child

tax allowances.

|3. These figures reflect the rise in the standard employees&apos; NIC

Irate from 6%% to 9%. The lower rates introduced in the 1985 Finance

Act do not affect the cases shown. So far as income tax is

concerned, personal allowances have increased by about 22% in real

terms since 1978-79, slightly less than earnings. The basic rate

has been reduced from 33p to 27p, but the 25p reduced rate band has

| been abolished.

14. As the table shows, indexation of allowances in the Budget

would   lead   to   a slight rise in the proportion of incomes taken in

I tax and NICs. This is because earnings are assumed to rise by more

than the increase in tax thresholds, which is indexed to changes in

prices.

Business Taxation

I 5. Following the sharp rise in corporation tax receipts over the

past two years, total taxes paid by businesses (outside the North

Sea) are now higher as a percentage of GDP than in 1978-79. Within

this total, the major change has been a fall in employers&apos; NICs and

NIS as a percentage of GDP, offset by increases in corporation tax,

business rates and &apos;other&apos; taxes as the following table shows:
