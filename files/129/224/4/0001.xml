CABINET

ROVER GROUP

Note by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry

Since the sale of the commercial vehicle subsidiaries to DAF last

year, Rover Group (RG) Chairman, Mr Graham Day, has been

reviewing options for the return of the remaining RG businesses,

principally Austin Rover and Land Rover,  to the private sector.

Recent studies have concentrated on the possibility of placement/

flotation, though it appears that the prospects of achieving this

within an acceptable time-frame seem remote.

2. However, an unexpected opportunity to dispose of these

businesses has now arisen.      I have recently received an

unsolicited approach from British Aerospace Pic who have declared

a serious interest in acguiring the whole of the issued share

capital of RG.        Subject to certain conditions they would like

to open negotiations for the purchase of the Government&apos;s

shareholding.

3. My subsequent discussions with BAe have focused on reaching

a broad understanding with them on key issues to establish

whether we could have sufficient confidence in a successful

outcome to any negotiations to justify a public announcement.

The main points at issue have been:-

1


SECRET

SECRET

(a) Exclusivity of negotiation

BAe were insistent that they would not be prepared to enter into

a competitive bidding situation and would be ready to enter into

formal negotiation only if granted exclusivity.      In view of the

past history I have agreed with BAe that we shall be prepared to

deal with them on an exclusive basis but only for a limited

period (until 1 May) after which we would be free to examine

alternative options.    This would, of course,  leave us free to

consider any other unsolicited bids received from other parties.

(b) Government financial injection

BAe were looking for a Government cash injection sufficient both

to write off all debt and related liabilities of RG and to make a

worthwhile contribution to the working capital needs of the

acquired businesses.      In discussion, I have stressed the need

for Government to emerge with a deal which was publicly

defensible and which the EC Commission would approve under state

aid rules.    BAe have made a helpful response and I am satisfied

that in negotiation we shall be able to arrive at a mutually

acceptable figure.

(c) Restrictions on resale of the businesses

BAe were anxious to retain complete freedom to manage the

acquired businesses according to commercial need.      My concern

was the possibility that, having acquired the businesses on

arguably favourable terms, BAe would be free to on-sell to trade

buyers at a potentially handsome profit.


SECRET

SECRET

I have made clear to BAe that we will need to devise a

mechanism to ensure that they would not dispose of either of the

businesses for a period of at least five years from completion of

any purchase.

(d) Honda

BAe recognise the importance of the Honda collaboration to ARG

and would wish this to continue.    Graham Day has advised that, in

his judgement, Honda can be expected to co-operate with BAe

post-acquisition but I have undertaken personally to impress upon

Honda that we would also welcome this.

4. INDUSTRIAL LOGIC

Linkages between the aerospace and motor industries are not

uncommon.      General Motors, Fiat and SAAB are among those

companies who, as well as being major vehicle producers, have

important aerospace operations.    And Daimler Benz have been

talking to MBB.      For their part, BAe also anticipate R&amp;D,

engineering, manufacturing technology and overseas marketing

synergies which would make acquisition of RG a sensible means of

developing a larger and more broadly based business.

5. CONCLUSIONS

On the basis of the understandings reached with BAe, I believe

that the prospects of a successful negotiation are good.    A deal

would also,  I believe, be welcomed by RG&apos;s management, workforce,

distributors, dealers and suppliers.      As a British solution it

would avoid the controversy involved in a foreign take-over and

would have strong backing amongst our own supporters.

6.     Subject to the agreement of colleagues,  I would therefore

propose to make an announcement to Parliament this afternoon in

.. the terms of the attached statement.
