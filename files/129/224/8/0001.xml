THE THYSSEN-BORNEMISZA COLLECTION

Xfle^OTandum by the Secretary of State for the Environment

\&lt; and the Minister for the Arts

The Thyssen Trust are seeking a long-term home for the

Thyssen-Bornemir *ayCollection of which some 50 pictures are currently on

display at the\EovVLAcademy.    The Collection, which is one of the

highest distinctf^o/fTyjonsists of over 1,300 pictures currently valued at

about  670 millioxk-^Z^S

2. Baron Thyssen aMrrnA. Trustees envisage making over the best of

these pictures, the Ti^-^K} ) pictures and the best 500 of the second

category of pictures,  the^^^f&apos; ) pictures, with   such other pictures

from the Collection as m&amp;^aeymutually agreed, to a new foundation in a

country of their choice. ^b^^? cipient country would provide a gallery

where the pictures would be ^Jv^^roanent display to the public; and

would pay a suitable sum in (nanm^ftsation to the beneficiaries of the

Trust for the surrender of the^^irghts in the pictures transferred.

3. A number of countries have mad^eyffers for these pictures,

including Germany and Spain.    The G&amp;tty Foundation has also expressed an

interest.   None of the offers so fa^tfi3&lt;re have been regarded by Baron

Thyssen or the Trustees as providing a^ea^isfactory long-term

destination for the pictures, although^&amp;He Baron (whose current wife is

Spanish) has personally signed a memorandum of understanding with the

Spanish Government envisaging the establishment of a foundation in Spain

and the loan of the pictures for exhibition in Spain for up to ten years

and possibly longer. //^~~\\

4. Notwithstanding this memorandum of agreemetn^piiaron Thyssen and the

Trustees have indicated that they would be glad Wo_Vap ider an offer

from Britain to provide a permanent home for the Cpfcfflction. There is to

be a meeting of the Thyssen Foundation in early June/ wrw)f the Trustees

in July, at which a decision about the proposal to bS^^rf^ued is likely

to be taken.    If a proposal from the British Government y&amp;fet to be

accepted in principle there would be a lot of important^M&gt;fMis to be

covered in negotiations before an agreement could be reas^^rj^in

particular our knowledge of the legal position is limited. ^^Aort Bill

would then need to be presented to Parliament, probably nem,Se^ftion, to

establish the new United Kingdom foundation and to provide ca^gf/tyr

It


committing funds to the payment of compensation, and the provision of a

gallery and its running costs.

^5.      We have discussed what proposal might be put to the Trustees, and

 ^^his has been discussed in a small Group under the Prime Minister. A

r^^Milistic offer would have to include a sum of about  120 million as

^&gt;erappensation for the beneficiaries for the making over of this valuable

^cV^L^OLtion worth over  600 million, and about  38 million for the

prGvjA^on of a gallery, in addition to the site costs.    It is also

es&lt; ma e&gt;l that the running costs of the gallery might be  4 million per

annum^tfp^-fcpp of the yield of admission charges and other contributions.

The awiyigements should be such as to encourage as much private

finane\x/&amp;yti possible,  in addition to the very large private subvention

represented by the pictures themselves and the contribution that may be

expected from the developers.    Such arrangements however are unlikely

greatly to diminish the sums mentioned above.    The Minister for the Arts

has said that th^y-^could not be provided from existing provision for the

Arts Budget.    TnftKb view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the

Chief Secretary^he--r 8t will need to be taken into account in the next

Public Expenditure/Survey when considering provision for other arts

expenditure beyonoxl&amp;s^y&apos;hree-year programme agreed in the last Survey.

6. Two sites have b^ r&gt;^Xentified which, on the basis of preliminary

discussions with the B r/ox^,jpmight be acceptable.    One is in Canary

Wharf, London, and the othrjxf/ln an inner city site in Birmingham. A

third site, The Grange in&lt;1&amp;mr)shire was suggested to the Baron at an

earlier meeting.    The owneVy_4 rjNjohn Baring,  is on reflection unwilling

to make the site available, wh^vanary Wharf site would be made

available free of charge by tlyj/diifrelopers of Canary Wharf who would

also consider a contribution tr/ fli^osts of the building and in

Birmingham the site would be proWde^by the City Council.

7. The draft of a proposal to the es is set out in the attached

papers.    The Trustees would wish to S ri3r5der it in confidence but it is

bound to become known, whether or not IjL/yx successful.    It will be

controversial, not least with other ar tVfinterests which would argue

that, if funds of this order could be made available, they should be

provided to improve the care and display of existing collections or to

meet other existing arts needs in this country.^ But this is a unique

opportunity to acquire permanently for this coatltrM a magnificent Art

Collection at a fraction of its value; we oughts-gale miss the chance.

8. The Cabinet is invited to agree that a propou&amp;J^e$ the lines of the

paper attached to this memorandum should be submit t^dTr^Baron Thyssen

and the Thyssen Trustees for consideration at their ^p^efo^oming meeting.

DRAFT COVERING LETTER TO BARON THYSSEN

Her Majesty&apos;s Government understands that the Trustees of the

Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection are considering the long-term

future of the Collection.

Her Majesty&apos;s Government wishes to take this opportunity to

propose arrangements for providing a permanent home for this

pre-eminent Collection in the United Kingdom. Mer Majesty&apos;s

Government believes that this would bring great benefits both to

the British people and to the many visitors to this country; and

would thus at the same time fulfil your own objective of making

the collection as widely accessible as possible. If the Trustees

were to decide, with your own approval,  that this magnificent

Collection should be located in the United Kingdom such a

decision would be warmly welcomed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.

Of course, the decision cannot be that of Her Majesty&apos;s

Government alone. An acquisition as important as this must be

sanctioned by Parliament. Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be

willing to seek approval from Parliament to the acquisition if

arrangements to the satisfaction of both the Trustees and Her

Majesty&apos;s Government can be agreed in principle. I have been

authorised to say that, to achieve such agreement, Her Majesty&apos;s

Government would welcome the opportunity to discuss with the

Trustees arrangements on the lines set out in the note enclosed

with this letter.

Her Majesty&apos;s Government, and Parliament before it sanctioned the

acquisition, would need to be satisfied of various important

matters included in the note and its annexes. It would of course

be especially important to be clear, before Her Majesty&apos;s

Government approached Parliament, that no dispute could

foreseeably arise over the power of the Trustees to pass an

absolute and unencumbered title in the pictures to the new


Foundation in the United Kingdom. I feel sure that you and the

Trustees would give our representatives the assistance they will

require to confirm this and other points.

Because of the pre-eminent position of the Collection Her

Majesty&apos;s Government would intend not only to seek the sanction

of Parliament to its acquisition but would also ask Parliament to

provide, through legislation, for the establishment of the new

Foundation in the United Kingdom which would own and control the

pictures. It is considered that the status conferred on the

Foundation by such statutory authority would be commensurate with

the importance of the Collection and would best achieve the

arrangements for the Foundation which Her Majesty&apos;s Government

believes will be thought desirable by yourself as well as by

Parliament.

Her Majesty&apos;s Government would hope that the Trustees would

decide in principle before the end of July whether they wish to

pursue this proposal.

Her Majesty&apos;s Government recognise and admire the generosity and

munificence involved in the suggestion which originated with

yourself and to which its own proposals relate and it warmly

hopes that you and the Trustees will give them favourable

consideration.

I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr Paul Coleridge as

chairman of the Trustees.


CONFIDENTIAL

THE THYSSEN-BORNEMISZA COLLECTION

Her Majesty&apos;s Government is interested in negotiating

arrangements under which the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection could

be given a permanent home in the United Kingdom.      This note sets

out the Government&apos;s view on the form that such arrangements

should take.

2. HMG understands that the Collection, which is owned by the

Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Collections Trust, at present comprises

1365 pictures as follows:

A B+ B- C Totals

Old Masters      127      218        127 56 528

Modern Masters      100      278        316       143 837

227      496        443        199 1365

3.    The main features of the arrangement would be:

(a) All the 227 A pictures, at present on loan to the

Thyssen Foundation in Lugano,  should be made over in

perpetuity to a new Foundation, to be set up as soon as

possible in tl*e UK for the specific purpose of owning,

caring for and exhibiting the Collection to the public.

Further proposals for the constitution and powers of the

new Trust are at Annex A.

(b) The best of the &apos;B&apos; pictures (about 500) would also be

made over to the new Foundation,  together with such ether

pictures from the Collection as may be mutually agreed.


(c) HMG would be prepared to ask Parliament to grant up to

a maximum of  120m which it would pay to the Trustees in

compensation for the rights surrendered in (a) and (b).

(d) Subject to any necessary Parliamentary approval, HMG

would ensure the provision of a Gallery on a site to be

agreed with Baron Thyssen, constructed and fitted out in

such a way that the Collection can be cared for and

exhibited at a high standard and be accessible to the

public.     Further proposals for the site, reflecting

preliminary discussions with Baron Thyssen,  are at Annex B.

HMG would expect the construction cost of such a Gallery to

be around  38m, excluding site costs.

(e) The Gallery should be named &quot;The Thyssen Gallery&quot;.

In addition to the storage and exhibition of the pictures,

it should make provision for conservation,  and have other

facilities, eg for education and scholarship, appropriate

to a major public gallery.

(f) HMG would seek Parliamentary approval to make a

contribution of up to  4m towards the maintenance and

running costs of the Gallery;    the Foundation would be

responsible for raising any additional sums that were

necessary for these purposes, eg by charging for admission.

&apos;4.    The next step should be the holding of negotiations between

HMG and the Thyssen interests in order to arrive at a detailed

and binding agreement.      While these negotiations are in

progress,  no other negotiations would take place between the

Thyssen interests and any other Government or interested party

over the future of the Collection;    and no new loans of pictures

from the Collection would be made without full consultation with

HMG.      As part of the negotiations, steps should be taken to

assure HMG that the present Trustees are in a position to pass an


absolute and unencumbered title in the pictures to the new

Foundation.

5.    It is proposed that the agreement to be negotiated should

take a form in which:

(i) the first step would be to set up the new Foundation,

appoint its Trustees and enable it to employ a Director and

such other staff as are needed to carry out preliminary

work;

(ii) decisions would then be taken about which B and (if

any) C pictures would be acquired by the new Foundation;

(iii) appropriate arrangements would be made for the

vesting of the pictures in the new Foundation and for their

physical delivery to its Trustees;    and for the timing of

payments by HMG under paragraph 3(c)  above in relation to

the timing of delivery;

(iv) prior to the taking of decisions on acquisition by

the new Foundation,  facilities for inspecting and verifying

the authenticity, condition, title and deliverability of

the pictures concerned would be extended to experts

nominated by HMG for this purpose;  

(v) the Trustees of the new Foundation would be

responsible for obtaining the necessary planning consents,

drawing up the brief for the new building and ensuring its

construction within cost limits laid down by HMG.


ANNEX A

THE THYSSEN FOUNDATION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM

1. The Collection and the Gallery would be vested in an

independent body of Trustees set up by legislation cr otherwise

under English law.

2. Baron Thyssen would be the first Chairman for as long as he

wishes to serve, with the right to nominate his own successor

subject to the consent of HMG.      Thereafter the Trustees would

elect their own Chairman, again subject to the consent of HMG.

3. In addition to the Chairman, there should be 12 Trustees, 5

appointed by the Thyssen interests and 7 by HMG.      All Trustees

(with the exception of Baron Thyssen as first Chairman)  to serve

for a period of 5 years, capable of renewal.      An appropriate

definition of the Thyssen interests would be needed for

incorporation in the founding legislation or other instrument.

4. The Trustees should be equipped with the necessary powers to

(a) appoint and employ a Director and staff;

(b) care for, preserve and add to the objects in their

Collection;

(c) exhibit the objects to the public and provide access

to them for the purposes of study and research;

(d) generally promote enjoyment ana understanding of the

fine arts.


CONFIDENTIAL

(e)    carry out all the managerial and administrative

functions required for the fulfilment of the above objects.

5. Since the &quot;A&quot; and the best &quot;B&quot; pictures are to be transferred

under a condition of perpetuity, the Trustees would not have

powers to dispose of them.      They would however be empowered to

dispose of other items in the Collection, subject to the approval

of HMG.      The proceeds of any such disposal may be applied by the

Trustees to the purposes of the Gallery as they see fit.

6. The Trustees would obtain the consent of HMG before disposing

of any land or buildings.

7. The Trustees may loan items from the Collection for

exhibition elsewhere in the UK or abroad, subject to suitable

arrangements for ensuring that a high proportion of the &quot;A&quot;

pictures is always on exhibition in the UK.

8. The Trustees would appoint a Director of the Gallery with the

consent of HMG.      They may also appoint other employees.

9. Within the limits of their annual income, the Trustees would

be free to pay to their employees such remuneraton and allowances

and to appoint them on such other terms and conditions as the

Trustees may determine.      The salary of the Director would be

subject to approval by HMG.

10. There would be an appropriate requirement for the minimum

number of days in the year on which the Gallery would be open to

the public.

11. The Trustees would appoint their own professionally

qualified auditors.    The Comptroller and Auditor General would

have access to their books and records.


CANARY WHARF:  LONDON DOCKLANDS

Canary Wharf, which lies alongside the River Thames immediately

to the east of the city of London,  is to be developed to provide a

new business district.    It will include 12.5 million sq ft of office

and retail accommodation and hotel and leisure facilities and

will be the world&apos;s largest single development.

Two sites (1 and 2 on the enclosed plans) could be made

available for the gallery.    The first site lies on the

proposed West Ferry Circus,  on axis with the main approach to

Canary Wharf,  and enjoys views up river to the City. The

second site lies on the waterfront to the south of West Ferry

Circus.    An indication of the proposed development of Canary

Wharf is shown in the enclosed drawings.

The site will be served by the Docklands Light Railway which

will provide access to Bank Station and the underground

network and London City Airport which lies 2 miles to the

east.    The Docklands Highway,  now under construction, will

connect Dockland to Britain&apos;s motorway system.    The proposed

east London River crossing will connect to the A2 and, by

1993,  the Channel Tunnel will complete motorway and rail links

with Europe.    Parking for 6,500 cars will be available within

Canary Wharf.    The new Thames Line Riverbus will link Canary

Wharf with stations on the river from Chelsea to Greenwich.

More than 20 million people live within one hour&apos;s travel

time.

The construction of a gallery could be timed to coincide with

the completion of the development of Canary Wharf in 1992.

CANARY WHARF, DOCK


CENTENARY SQUARE: BIRMINGHAM

Birmingham is the second largest city in England with a

population of more than 1 million.    A site could be made

available for the gallery in the city centre on the north side

of Centenary Square.    Major redevelopment of the square, now in

progress,  includes construction of an international convention

centre,  concert hall and hotel.    Adjoining the square are the

Central Television headquarters and Europe&apos;s largest municipal

library.    The site is illustrated in the drawings and

photographs enclosed.

The site is close to the Birmingham inner ring road which

links to the. Aston Expressway and the M6 motorway. Parking

will be available close to the square for 4,000 cars. New

Street Station, which provides a direct rail link with London

and other cities,  is within 1 kilometre (% mile). Birmingham

International airport can be reached in 15 minutes.    7 Million

people live within one hour&apos;s travel by road.

The convention centre is expected to be completed by 1991 and

the construction of the gallery could follow on to complete

the development of the square.
