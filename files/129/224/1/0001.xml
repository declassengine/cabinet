\&gt; WAR CRIMES

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department

This paper sets Mj^otjr proposals for the future handling of allegations

that ex-Nazi war cT^P^/als are living in the United Kingdom.

BACKGROUND

2.      When we discussed Cjre^svbject at the meeting of the Home and Social

Affairs Committee (H(87)\^^A^the Committee was unable at that time to

agree to the Home SecretarVJ^ftcoposals to introduce an amendment to the

Criminal Justice Bill which\^ovj)a\ give the United Kingdom courts

jurisdiction over war crimes^^mmtted during the Second World War by

persons who subsequently became/4 r&apos;iyish citizens or settled in the United

Kingdom.    He was invited to consuj^/^jterested colleagues about the

precise definition of the proposeoitfplsdiction and to report the outcome

to the Committee in January.    In tfe-&lt;fi^rse of our further meetings with

the Lord Chancellor, Law Officers andywos^wiess Managers,  it has become

clear that any proposal to extend Jurassiction through the Criminal

Justice Bill would cause difficulties i3 r the tight Parliamentary

timetable.    In reviewing the options we have however agreed that we should

take further action regarding the very serious allegations which have been

INDEPENDENT INQUIRY

3.      It is proposed that we should appoint two rrvSj^endent advisers who

would examine the material that has been submittec-^D^J&amp; and advise

whether the public interest would be served by our t^Jrfefc&gt;. jurisdiction.

In undertaking this inquiry, the advisers would as sess^&amp;hep* strength of the

case for any potential prosecutions, including interview2&gt;%$Nwitnesses in

the Soviet Union and assessing the probative value of ai^&apos;ejM.dence they

might give and of Soviet documents in court in this counbi?y^Y^uch an

investigation would assist us in judging the likelihood thw^ jporosecution

could get off the ground if the law were changed.    We do noB^j^Hbpose that

the inquiry should be set up on a statutory basis, but the lacXA^^DOwers

to compel the giving of evidence should not be a serious hindr^nce^A


^    LIKELY REACTION TO AN INQUIRY

 y|4.      The setting up of an inquiry would prevent us from legislating in the

X^&amp;riminal Justice Bill, and may well be criticised as procrastination. We

-v^wy also have some difficulty in convincing Parliament to reject

Vv j^Hj^dments to the Bill which backbenchers seem likely to table.    We should

Ofavj^pto defend our decision on the basis that we need a better assessment

oQi/fti \facts before legislating on this controversial issue, and that

leg*^fa^aon to take jurisdiction when no prosectuion is likely to result

would/pe\a waste of Parliamentary time.    The Soviet authorities are

thougQjT^^Kely to co-operate in an inquiry, by permitting its members to

interviev^p^ssible witnesses and by providing additional documentation.

But they^may not readily appreciate that the function of the inquiry is to

advise onvchanges to United Kingdom law rather than to prepare a case for

prosecution.    There is a considerable risk of an adverse Soviet reaction

if the inquiry recommends against legislation or comments unfavourably

upon the validy y-^f material provided by Soviet witnesses or documents.

TERMS OF REFERENC^&quot;^

5. The purpose or^teie/inquiry would be to advise us, on an assessment of

the strength of the e^rjfence available for use in proceedings in this

country, whether the Ww&lt;s^uld be changed so as to extend the

jurisdiction of our courti/^We think it desirable to draw the terms of

reference fairly widely,&lt; #/Cthat the precise extent of any jurisdiction

that might eventually be E^k^w^ould be determined in the light of the

inquiry&apos;s report.    SuggestecC^m^s of reference for the inquiry are

attached at Annex A:    they naVe^b^pn agreed between interested Departments

at official level. /)&gt;

PUBLICATION OF REPORT &lt;^y~&gt;

6. The inquiry is likely to take year to report.    The question

of publication could be awkward, sinc^4W^material which the inquiry will

review will focus very much on allegarCcjrs against named individuals, and

it will be essential to avoid prejudicii^ any prosecution that might

conceivably ensue.    If the report recommended legislation which would

enable individuals to be prosecuted in due course, we envisage that it

might be confined to summarising the extent of/fEfc inquiry; presenting the

conclusion that the likely probative value of(che^evidence obtained

justified that assumption of jurisdiction and ^Sfe^eiihsequent

recommendation in favour of amending the law; anaj^Wording that the

evidence obtained had been deposited with the pro  3Mj Ang authorities.

If, however, it recommended against legislation, tfrea/i^probably ought to

indicate in broad terms the content of the evidence W^n^able and the

reasons why it did not appear sufficient to found prosecwJ^jDns.    In either

case there would be no obstacle to publication of the r^w^^s such.

7.      Irrespective of whether or not a detailed report is ptrJJ^^sXfid, there

is some potential embarrassment in the possibility that fortfowiagv the

assumption of jurisdiction - if the inquiry should so recommw*$^/the

prosecuting authority, who cannot be bound by the inquiry&apos;s fiaarprg ^ may

conclude that the evidence, for whatever reason, did not justify


prosecution in any particular case.    That, however, would seem unavoidable

in an inquiry of this nature.

^HOICE OF ADVISERS

\&amp;C)   We believe that the inquiry should not be carried out at a high

C^fc^flle.    Clearly the advisers should command confidence, but we do not

^frtft^nousehold names.    The Lord Chancellor has suggested that the recently

re  re %Director of Public Prosecutions (Sir Thomas Hetherington) and the

form^/Crown Agent for Scotland (Mr William Chalmers) would be suitable

for RjSSrtlfisignment.    The Solicitor General is however doubtful about the

particvpajt&apos;pbn of a former Director, on the basis that he has had no

investigation function (in contrast to the Crown Agent) and that an

inquiry conducted by a former Director might appear to prejudge any

eventual decision of the Crown Prosecution Service.

9.     We do not/mitoV. these considerations should necessarily rule out the

appointment oA.(a farmer Director of Public Prosecutions.    The task of the

inquiry is not TTrtpiTed to investigation:    its principal remit would be to

assess whether tnk_J/ah*.should be changed in the light of the likely

probative value ozTrpf/evidence in proceedings if the necessary

jurisdiction existed/A^fris function lies clearly in the realm of

prosecutorial exper ierceO^It is also clear that, even if the inquiry

concluded in favour or lVgrj&amp;lation on the basis of its assessment of the

evidence, the prosecut irf ^*mior ities would not be obliged to follow any

recommendation as to proff^u^/pn.    Subject to any views expressed by

colleagues, we shall consida^Ttfl^is aspect further with the Law Officers,

including the possibility oB\ap\x&lt;inting a former senior Treasury Counsel

or Queen&apos;s Counsel with simir^r^yBX ^rience of major prosecutions.    It has

also been suggested that a rece^j^yycetired civil seiVant from one of the

Home Departments might be appointpd^-^ince the issue may not be entirely

forensic, and this is also a matter^*?which we would wish to give further

consideration.

RESOURCES \^

10.    If we decide to set up an inquiry along the lines proposed, various

costs would be incurred.   The advisers would need support staff, at the

minimum an administrative secretary at Grade VjCftvel and a personal

secretary or typist.    They might also need tti/ s^jvices of a retired

police officer to support the investigative si3Vj5i\their work.    They will

also need accommodation.    In addition we shall sfe*y/-$ Pav tne advisers,

presumably on the basis of a daily fee.    They witt^iyo incur subsistence

and travelling costs, and there may also be consiaeyaVfe costs in

obtaining documents and in procuring translations aajf^wff^cerpreting. No

provision is available from within existing departmenta^jpjsources to

cover such expenditure, and it is too late to bid for ^M/pecessary funds

in the next PES round since the inquiry could well be ov^(rriifore the

start of 1989-90.    It would seem necessary that the costV-^r^fcAe inquiry,

which could be of the order of  0.5 million, should be a cXter^exm the

Contingency Reserve. (/llss

CONCLUSION

Given the pressures on the Parliamentary timetable, an inquiry on the

SJpbove lines probably offers the best way forward.    But a decision to go

an inquiry rather than take jurisdiction in the Criminal Justice Bill

Vv^s/likely to be criticised.    We need therefore to be able to announce

&lt;^ kat&lt;  if the advisers so recommend, we shall consider early steps to

ipproi^ice legislation.    Subject to resolution of the practical points

diso^8^d in paragraphs 9-10 above, the Home Secretary would hope to be in

a posi-t^on to make an early announcement.    We invite colleagues&apos; agreement

that^wr^Sftbuld proceed accordingly, and that the Homo Secretary ohould

roport^^p^biwet the euteome of our consideration.

ANNEX A

INQUIRY INTO WAR CRIMES:

SUGGESTED TERMS OF REFERENCE

(1) To obtain and examine relevant material, including material

held by Government Departments and documents which have been

or may be submitted by the Simon Wiesenthal Center and others,

relating to allegations that persons who are now British

citizens or resident in the United Kingdom committed war

crimes* during the Second World War;

(2) To interview persons who appear to possess relevant

information relating to such allegations;

(3) To consider, in the light of the likely probative value in

court proceedings in the UK of the relevant documentary

material and of the evidence of potential witnesses, whether

the law of the United Kingdom should be amended in order to

make it possible to prosecute for war crimes persons who are

now British citizens or resident in the United Kingdom;

(4) And to advise Her Majesty&apos;s Government accordingly.

*For the purposes of this inquiry, the term &quot;war crimes&quot; extends onlyt

crimes of murder, manslaughter or genocide committed in Germany and

in territories occupied by German forces during the Second World

War .
