&lt;&lt;^/&gt;IMP ROVING MANAGEMENT IN GOVERNMENT:    THE NEXT STEPS

Note by the Secretary of the Cabinet

Last year at the Prime Minister&apos;s request the Efficiency Unit carried out

a scrutiny to re^JSv progress with the reform of management in Government

Departments andf(to Consider the way forward.    A Group of Ministers under

the Prime Minisce^-^-^hairmanship has met three times to consider the

Unit&apos;s report, whmh__Xs&apos;*a11ached at Annex A.

2.      The Group of Hinxdf&amp;rig. concluded that the Government should endorse

the following recommenvStfu^oe of the report -

a. To the greatestor   ^ble extent the executive functions of

Government, that is s^xv^e^delivery undertaken by Departments rather

than Non-Departmental FnJ53j( oBodies,  should be carried out by

executive units clearly i^sv&amp;iifcted within Departments, referred to in

, the report as  &apos;agencies &apos; ,M^ra_jResponsibility for day-to-day

operations delegated to a Ch&gt;l4 r xecutive responsible for management

within policy objectives and a^^rt^urces framework set by the

responsible Minister.

b. Ministers should commit them^e^veA to and put in hand a

programme for completing the implementation of this objective

progressively, agency by agency. N\

c. Staff should be properly trained and prepared for management of

the delivery of services whether within or^Ekside central

Government. \f (J

d. There should be a force for improvement f^ft^yie centre of

Government which would maintain pressure on DeMTMents to improve

and develop their operations, and in particulaiV^/J^^oject Manager&apos;

at a senior level to ensure that the programme oS^^nkh\e took place.

The Group agreed that these recommendations should be imp^2j &amp;iui.ed

according to procedures designed to ensure the proper conrcolyate^public

expenditure, running costs and pay.    At the same time the aVrJwgskents

should be operated in a manner which will encourage a greater\^ej k v of

responsibility for the achievement of value for money, and bri^g^Wout a


^ release of greater management energy to this end. At Annex B is a note by

?Othe Treasury outlining a procedure for setting up the initial agencies and

^vvtheir subsequent control.

^~yO(^S.   Some particular aspects which the Group discussed include -

^/yi/yA- Legislation

cyy\ ....

&gt; rtgatmg agencies within Departments to handle distinct executive

^furfjzrions will not generally require legislation, though it may in

wjjS^djSular cases.    Privatising or converting into Non-Departmental

PuBi4^/ odies (or vice versa) usually would.    Some changes in

Parliamentary financial controls could need legislation if it were

deciHkd to implement them.

b. Acccountability

Minis ters &apos; (psri^l accountability to Parliament will be unchanged by

these propo^s2DL^^i.lthough their detachment from day-to-day operations

would entail qhaages in the way in which it is discharged.

Parliamentary\j**e^5ions will always be answered by the responsible

Minister.    He may/jMj&amp;vt o encourage MPs to address operational

inquiries first tx^rfjgkwcy managers but MPs will keep the right to

approach the MinisVerVcLrtect,  if they are dissatisfied with the

reply. &lt;\^)

c. Privatisation andN^t^fi^^i

When deciding how best to^^wLvex executive functions, privatisations

should always be considerea aa^vorior option.    Th&apos;is has the merit of

bringing natural commercial praa^c^es for efficiency and

effectiveness.    In cases where^thj^p is not possible, setting up an

agency within a Department can {Sj^vjtjv a rigorous basis for control,

while distancing Ministers from aaS ^cop day operations.    This can be a

more appropriate arrangement for d\ ^rarging some functions than a

Non-Departmental Public Body (quangcA.

d. Agency Chief Executive Appointments and Terms of Service

I. INTRODUCTION

1. As a result of initiatives taken since 1979, the management of

government business is much improved, especially in those parts of

government where there are clear tasks to be performed and services to

be delivered.   But there is still a long way to go; in particular there

is insufficient sense of urgency in the search for better value for

money and steadily improving services.   There is wide agreement in

Departments themselves that substantial further improvement is

achievable, but that this depends heavily on changing the cultural

attitudes and behaviour of government so that continuous improvement

becomes a widespread and in-built feature of it.   This report makes

recommendations on the structure and management needed for the better

delivery of services both to the public and to Ministers, the

experience that staff need to be given and how sustained pressure for

improvement can be developed.   This should bring the changes needed in

attitudes and behaviour and with them progressive improvement in

performance.

II. FINDINGS

2. As part of this scrutiny we have spent 3 months in discussions

with people in the Civil Service throughout the country.   We have also

reviewed the evidence from other scrutinies in the central programme

since 1979 and looked at earlier reports on the management of the Civil

Service.   The themes which have emerged during the scrutiny have

followed a broadly consistent pattern, whether in discussions in a

small local benefit office or in a Minister&apos;s room. Some are also

common themes in earlier scrutinies and in reports on the Civil Service

(see Annex 2).   There are seven main findings.

3. First, the management and staff concerned with the delivery of

government services (some 95% of the Civil Service) are generally

convinced that the developments towards more clearly defined and

budgeted management are positive and helpful. The manager of a small

local office in   the north east said that for the first time in 20

years he felt that he could have an effect on the conditions under

which his staff worked and therefore on the results they produced. But

this kind of enthusiasm is tempered by frustration at constraints.

Although there is a general acceptance of the importance of delegating

meaningful authority down to the most effective level, diffused

responsibility still flourishes, especially in offices away from the

sharp end of delivery of services to the public.   Middle managers in

particular feel that their authority is seriously circumscribed both by

unnecessary   controls and by the intervention of Ministers and senior

officials in relatively minor issues.   People who had recently resigned

from the Civil Service told us that frustration at the lack of genuine

responsibility for achieving results was a significant factor in

encouraging them to move to jobs outside.


4. Second, most civil servants are very conscious that senior

management is dominated by people whose skills are in policy

formulation and who have relatively little experience of managing or

working where services are actually being delivered.   In any large

organisation senior appointments are watched with close attention. For

the Civil Service the present signals are, as one senior Grade 2 told

us, that &quot;the golden route to the top is through policy not through

management&quot;.   This is reflected in the early experience and training of

fast-stream recruits.   This kind of signal affects the unwritten

priorities of a whole organisation, whatever the formal policy may be.

5. Managing large organisations involves skills which depend a great

deal on experience; without experience senior managers lack confidence

in the&apos;ir own ability to manage. Although, at the most senior levels,

civil servants are responsible for both policy and service delivery,

they give a greater priority to policy, not only because it demands

immediate attention but because that is the area in which they are on

familiar ground and where their skills lie, and where ministerial

attention is focused.   A proper balance between policy and delivery is

hard to achieve within the present framework, even though taxpayers are

becoming increasingly conscious of what they should expect from public

expenditure on health, education and other services and hold Ministers

to blame for their deficiencies.

6. Third, senior civil servants inevitably and rightly respond to

the priorities set by their Ministers which tend to be dominated by the

demands of Parliament and communicating government policier!   In this

situation it is easy for the task of improving performance   to get

overlooked, especially where there is, as we observed, confusion

between Ministers and Permanent Secretaries over their respective

responsibilities for the management of service delivery. This

confusion is made worse when short term pressure becomes acute.

Nevertheless the ability of Ministers supported by their senior

officials to handle politics and political sensitivities effectively is

a crucial part of any government&apos;s credibility.   Changes in the

management process should therefore aim to increase rather than

diminish this crucial skill.

7. Fourth, the greater diversity and complexity of work in many

Departments, together with demands from Parliament, the media and the

public for more information, has added to ministerial overload.

Because of other pressures on Ministers, and because for most of them

management is not their forte and they don&apos;t see it as their function,

better management and the achievement of improved performance is

something that the Civil Service has to work out largely for itself.

It is unrealistic to expect Ministers to do more than give a broad

lead.   Most Ministers who are worried about overload are of the view

that while changes in management that reduced the ministerial load

would be welcomed, provided they entailed no major political risks,

Ministers themselves do not have the time or the experience needed to

develop such changes.

8. Fifth, the pressures on Departments are mainly on expenditure and

activities; there is still too little attention paid to the results to

be achieved with the resources. The public expenditure system is the

most powerful central influence on departmental management. It is still

overwhelmingly dominated by the need to keep within the levels of money

available rather than by the effectiveness with which they are used.


9. Sixth, there are relatively few external pressures demanding

improvement in performance. The Prime Minister has given a valuable

lead and holds seminars to discuss value for money in individual

Departments.   Her Adviser on Efficiency and Effectiveness has annual

discussions with Ministers about their priorities for getting better

value for money. These are useful but occasional rather than continuous

pressures.   Pressure from Parliament, the Public Accounts Committee and

the media tends to concentrate on alleged impropriety or incompetence

and making political points, rather than on demanding evidence of

steadily improving efficiency and effectiveness.   This encourages a

cautious and defensive response which feeds through into management.

On the positive side, the Treasury and the NAO are developing work on

value for money.   But the process of searching for improvement is still

neither rigorous nor sustained; it is not yet part of the basic

institution of government.

10. Seventh, the Civil Service is too big and too diverse to manage

as a single entity.   With 600,000 employees it is an enormous-

organisation compared with any private sector company and most public

sector organisations.      A single organisation of this size which

attempts to provide a detailed structure within which to carry out

functions as diverse as driver licensing, fisheries protection, the

catching of drug smugglers and the processing of Parliamentary

Questions is bound to develop in a way which fits no single operation

effectively.

11. At present the freedom of an individual manager to manage

effectively and responsibly in the Civil Service is severely

circumscribed. There are controls not only on resources and objectives,

as there should be in any effective system, but also on the way in

which resources can be managed.   Recruitment, dismissal, choice of

staff, promotion, pay, hours of work, accommodation, grading,

organisation of work, the use of IT equipment, are all outside the

control of most Civil Service managers at any level.   The main

decisions on rules and regulations are taken by the centre of the Civil

Service.   This tends to mean that they are structured to fit everything

in general and nothing in particular.   The rules are therefore seen

primarily as a constraint rather than as a support; and in no sense as

a pressure on managers to manage effectively.   Moreover, the task of

changing the rules is often seen as too great for one unit or one

manager or indeed one Department and is therefore assumed to be

impossible.

12. In our discussions it was clear that the advantages which a

unified Civil Service are intended to bring are seen as outweighed by

the practical disadvantages, particularly beyond Whitehall itself. We

were told that the advantages of an all-embracing pay structure are

breaking down, that the uniformity of grading frequently inhibits

effective management and that the concept of a career in a unified

Civil Service has little relevance for most civil servants, whose

horizons are bounded by their local office or, at most, by their

Department.


III. CONCLUSIONS

13. The main themes which have emerged from our discussions in the

course of the scrutiny suggest that the changes of the last 7 years

have been important in beginning to shift the focus of attention away

from process towards results.   The development of management systems,

particularly those which cover programme as well as administrative

areas, forces senior and junior management to define the results they

wish to achieve.   But this also produces frustrations because of the

lack of freedom to vary the factors on which results depend.   The new

systems are demonstrating how far attitudes and institutions have to

change if the real benefits of the management reforms, in the form of

improvement in the way government delivers its services, are to come

through.   It was striking that in our discussions with civil servants

at all levels there was a strong sense that radical change in the

freedom to manage is needed urgently if substantially better results

are to be achieved.

14. Five main issues have emerged from the scrutiny.   First, a lack

of clear and accountable management responsibility, and the self

confidence that goes with it particularly among the higher ranks in

Departments.   Second, the need for greater precision about the

results expected of people and of organisations.   Third, a need to

focus attention on outputs as well as inputs.   Fourth, the handicap

of imposing   a uniform system in an organisation of the size and

diversity of the present Civil Service.   Fifth, a need for a

sustained pressure for improvement.

15. These are serious problems which need leadership, and commitment

to change, from Ministers and the senior Civil Service if they are to

be dealt with.   Our conclusions are that to begin the process of change

three main priorities are necessary:

First: The work of each Department must be organised in a way which

focuses on the job to be done; the systems and structures must enhance

the effective delivery of policies and services.

Second: The management of each Department must ensure that their

staff have the relevant experience and skills needed to do the tasks

that are essential to effective government.

Third: There must be a real and sustained pressure on and within each

Department for continuous improvement in the value for money obtained

in the delivery of policies and services.

These three priorities apply equally to all aspects of government. In

our recommendations we apply them to the delivery of services, the

tasks of Departments and the centre of Whitehall.   Simultaneous action

is needed on all three.


16.   It is important to recognise that the changes implied by these

conclusions, although straightforward, are quite fundamental in the

overall impact they will have if carried forward as we suggest. Some

fairly radical decisions and a tightly-knit timetable will be required

if the necessary momentum for change is to be built up.   But the

process, although it must be quite rapid to maintain that momentum,

will need to be evolutionary so as to gain full advantage from the

favourable climate we observed, and to build on moves of the right kind

already taking place in some Departments.   It will also need to be

tightly managed so that the acute problems of transition are properly

handled, and so that the drive for more positive management and more

freedom for local decision is not undermined by vested interests or

lack of confidence.


IV. RECOMMENDATIONS

1.     FOCUSING ON THE JOB TO BE DONE

17. Greater priority must be given to organising government so that

its service delivery operations function effectively.   This must be

backed by supporting changes in the attitudes and day-to-day behaviour

of Ministers and their officials.

18. Changes of the kind we are proposing are so fundamental that they

can be brought about only with the lead and support of Ministers.

Without this lead they will falter partly because of the inertia of any

very large organisation and a natural tendency for fine details to be

discussed at length, but partly because it is Ministers who will have

to explain, promote and defend them in Parliament as and when the

difficulties are encountered.

a.    The Delivery of Services

19. We recommend that &apos;agencies&apos; should be established to carry out

the executive functions of government within a policy and resources

framework set by a Department.   An &apos;agency&apos; of this kind may be part

of government and the public service, or it may be more effective

outside government.    We use the term &apos;agency&apos; not in its technical

sense but to describe any executive unit that delivers a service for

government.   The choice and definition of suitable agencies is

primarily for Ministers and senior management in Departments to

decide.   In some instances very large blocks of work comprising

virtually a whole Department will be suitable to be managed in this

way.   In other instances, where the scale of activity is too small for

an entirely separate organisation, it may be better to have one or even

several smaller agencies within Departments.

20. These units, large or small, need to be given a well defined

framework in which to operate, which sets out the policy, the budget,

specific targets and the results to be achieved.   It must also specify

how politically sensitive issues are to be dealt with and the extent of

the delegated authority of management.   The management of the agency

must be held rigorously to account by their Department for the results

they achieve.

21. The framework will need to be set and updated as part of a formal

annual review with the responsible Minister based on a long-term plan

and an annual report. The main strategic control must lie with the

Minister and Permanent Secretary.   But once the policy objectives and

budgets within the framework are set, the management of the agency

should then have as much independence as possible in deciding how those

objectives are met.   A crucial element in the relationship would be a

formal understanding with Ministers about the handling of sensitive

issues and the lines of accountability in a crisis.   The presumption

must be that, provided management is operating within the strategic

direction set by Ministers, it must be left as free as possible to

manage within that framework.   To strengthen operational effectiveness,

there must be freedom to recruit, pay, grade and structure in the most

effective way as the framework becomes sufficiently robust and there is

confidence in the capacity of management to handle the task.

8


22. Once the framework had been set the head of the agency would be

given personal responsibility to achieve the best possible results

within it.   He or she must be seen to be accountable for doing so. In

due course formal accountability, before the Public Accounts Committee

for example, might develop so that for significant agencies the

Permanent Secretary would normally be accompanied by the head of the

agency.   The Permanent Secretary&apos;s role would be to justify and defend

the framework; the manager would have to answer for his or her

performance within that framework.

23. Placing responsibility for performance squarely on the shoulders

of the manager of an agency also has implications for the way in which

Ministers answer to Parliament on operational issues. Clearly

Ministers have to be wholly responsible for policy, but it is

unrealistic to suppose that they can actually have knowledge in depth

about every operational question.   The convention that they do is in

part the cause of the overload we observed.   We believe it is possible

for Parliament, through Ministers, to regard managers as directly

responsible for operational matters and that there are precedents for

this and precisely defined ways in which it can be handled. If

management in the Civil Service is truly to be improved this aspect

cannot be ignored.   In view of its importance it is considered in more

detail in Annex 1, where it is suggested that to achieve changes in the

arrangements for formal accountability would generally require

legislation and that in suitable instances this should be considered.

24. The detailed nature of the relationship between a Department and

an agency will vary with the job to be done or the service to be

delivered.    The agency structure could be used to cover a substantial

proportion of the activities of the Civil Service.   It is clear from

our discussions with Permanent Secretaries that some Departments are

already moving towards this concept. What is needed is a substantial

acceleration   and broadening of this trend through a major initiative.

Ultimately some agencies could be in a position where they are no

longer inside the Civil Service in the sense they are today. Any

decision of this kind should be taken pragmatically - the test must

always be adopting the structure which best fits the job to be done.

b.    The Tasks for Departments

25. The setting up of agencies has substantial implications for the

staff of Departments, for Ministers, and for Parliament. Departments

have two main functions - ministerial support including policy

development and evaluation, and managing or influencing the delivery of

government services.   Where the Department is directly responsible for

service delivery their task will no longer be the detailed prescription

of operational functions: it will be the definition of a rigorous

policy and resources framework within which the agency management is

set free to manage operations, and is held to account for results.

26. The setting of a policy and resources framework is needed not

only for agencies but also in situations where the Department has to

proceed by influence rather than by   direct control. It applies

therefore to the relationship with any organisation which is providing

services for which the Department carries some responsibility, whether

agency, nationalised industry, local authority, or public body,

although the detail and the structure will vary with the precise

relationship and the job that has to be done.

9


27. In any of these relationships the Department&apos;s task is to set a

framework, tailored to the job to be done, which specifies policies,

objectives, the results required, and the resources available.   It will

also need to ensure that indicators of effective performance are

developed and used for regular monitoring.   For directly managed

agencies Ministers and civil servants must then stand back from

operational details and demonstrate their confidence in the competence

of their managers and the robustness of the framework by leaving

managers free to manage.

28. Although setting a framework is not a new task for government

Departments, it is one which has not generally attracted the attention

it deserves.   To do it successfully requires a balanced  expertise in

policy, the political environment and service delivery which too few

civil servants possess at present.   Operational effectiveness and

clarity need to be given a higher priority in the interpretation of

policy objectives and the thinking of Ministers.

29. We have already emphasised that, for the successful operation of

any agency, politically sensitive issues must be handled effectively.

Ministers and Departments will have to ensure that this happens if

difficulties are to be sorted out without shattering the position and

confidence of executive managers.   Unless the inevitable political

crises are handled well, while safeguarding the effectiveness of the

agency, the benefits of giving more independence to management and so

getting better performance will not emerge.   In some instances

legislation may be necessary to establish a framework within which the

agency can operate with sufficient independence on behalf of the

Secretary of State.

30. In order to direct the tasks of a Department effectively, senior

management will need the same kind of flexibility that we consider

necessary for agencies.   In particular they must have greater freedom

about how the Department is staffed and structured to ensure that they

are able to give priority to the main tasks for which the Department is

responsible.

31. We have concentrated on the role of Departments in relation to

their service delivery agencies, but the management of the policy areas

of Departments, although on a smaller scale in terms of the staff

numbers employed, is no less important than managing the big executive

areas.   Precision about the results required and the resources involved

is crucial when large programme resources are at stake.

c.    The Centre of Government

32. The identification of agencies and providing the necessary

framework within which they can be managed effectively are essentially

tasks for Departments, but the cultural changes implicit in these

simple ideas will only take place if a strong lead is given from the

centre.   Moreover the centre has to have confidence in the new pattern

before it can responsibly start relinquishing some of the present

constraints on Departments.   We are convinced that our recommendations

can be implemented successfully only if the centre takes a leading role

in managing the change.

10


33. It is important to distinguish the task of managing change, from

the longer term role of the centre when the new situation has been

brought about.   Once the change has been established we see four

continuing tasks for the centre which no-one else can do.   First, to

allocate resources; second, to ensure there is rigorous external

pressure on Departments continually to improve results; third; to

ensure that the overall shape of the Civil Service continues to respond

to changes in the needs^ of government and the country; fourth, to set

and police essential rules on propriety for the public service in

carrying out its essential functions.    The centre has to be

authoritative, demonstrably efficient and low cost, and a helpful

resource to Departments not a handicap.   Our specific recommendations

are given at paragraphs 40-42.

2.    THE RIGHT PEOPLE

34. Our first recommendation - the establishment of agencies for

government services - has implications for the functions and

organisation of Departments and may need a legislative framework in

some instances.   Its success depends critically on the people working

in Departments and the skills they bring to the task.   We recommend

that Departments ensure that their staff are properly trained and

experienced in the delivery of services whether within or outsfcfe

central government; the staff will then be in a position to develop and

interpret government policy and manage the agencies in a way that can

maximise results.&quot;

35. Departments must ensure that they have people who have the

managerial skills necessary to run agencies.   This will mean that

experience of managing the delivery of services must be built up at all

levels in a Department.   It is most important that there should not be

two classes of people in Departments - those in agencies and those at

the centre.   The aim must be to have senior managers who at more junior

levels have had substantial experience   of the skills and practical

reality of management as well as effective experience of the political

and policy aspects of work in a Department.   They must be prepared to

show real qualities of leadership, the ability to back their judgement

and to take and defend unpopular decisions.   Hitherto relatively few

civil servants have had an opportunity to learn or exhibit these

skills.   A wide range of new arrangements will be needed, including

training and secondments to give the required experience, and the

promotion of some younger people.

36. One of the benefits that will come as senior managers in

Departments obtain greater experience of management is that the policy

areas of Departments will also become better managed.   There will be an

increasing need for these senior managers to have greater freedom about

how the Department is structured and staffed to ensure that they can

give effective priority at any time to the most important tasks.

3.     PRESSURE FOR IMPROVEMENT

37. The aim of our first two recommendations is to ensure that the

organisational structure and the skills of the Civil Service are

adapted to deliver government services as effectively as possible. The

radical changes entailed for Departments will not happen without some

pressure external to the organisations directly involved. That pressure

must be both for change and for continuous improvement in the delivery

of services.

38. The responsibility for setting the management strategy for the

Civil Service and ensuring that there is pressure for change and

improvement inevitably rests with the Prime Minister and the Head of

the Civil Service.    They need the commitment of Ministers and of

Permanent Secretaries to ensure that the changes are pursued with

urgency and are not sacrificed to other priorities.   The pressure for

change from within the government must also be sustained by

understanding and support from Parliament for the long-term benefits

which are being sought.

39. For each of these groups - for Parliament, for Ministers and for

civil servants - a precise means of ensuring their support needs to be

developed.   The Civil Service must own the. changes as they evolve; it

must not feel that ill-considered change is being thrust on it.

Ministers must be confident that they can influence political aspects

of the changes, and that one of the benefits will be their being able

to concentrate more on their main political task. Further

consideration needs to be given to what arrangements would best ensure

that each group plays the right role in directing and sustaining the

changes.

40. However, pressure at the highest level will only be effective if

the centre of the Civil Service is organised with certain essential

characteristics.   It must be authoritative, and able to ensure that its

authority is recognised and acted upon.   It must be &quot;slimline&quot;: the

development of a new bureaucracy would be disastrous.   It must be seen

to be competent and helping rather than obstructing the delivery of

effective service by operational Departments.   It must be cohesive and

not as apparently diverse and fragmented as at present.

41. Our recommendations on changes in the way Departments operate are

fundamental and radical.   They will only be introduced successfully if

there is an extremely senior official who has unequivocal personal

responsibility for achieving the change.   The Head of the Civil Service

has to be personally committed to the change; but with his other

responsibilities he cannot be expected to devote the time and energy to

managing the change that the task demands.   We recommend that a full

Permanent Secretary should be designated as &quot;Project Manager&quot; as soo&apos;n

as possible to ensure that the change takes place. He will need to

work with the authority of the Prime Minister and the Head of the Civil

Service, to whom he should report.


42.   The Project Manager will be responsible for planning and

supervising the process of change.   The   Prime Minister will regularly

receive reports from him, via the Head of the Civil Service, on the

progress made by Departments in setting frameworks for their agencies

and on the timetable for relaxing the constraints on management. The

Project Manager will also have to ensure that Departments have enough

flexibility to handle their tasks effectively.   To do this, he will

have to make certain that obstacles to change are removed and that the

totality of the centre is helpful to the management of change. The

need to have a very high level project manager cannot be

overemphasised.   A more junior project manager will not carry weight

with Departments.   The slow rate of progress on so many of the changes

since 1979, even with ministerial support and an abundance of small

units, is ample evidence of this.


V:   THE NEXT STEPS

43. This report is concerned with identifying the fundamental changes

needed to achieve a further major step forward in the delivery of

services and the management of government.   We have avoided detailed

prescription because so much depends on the individual tasks of

different Departments.   Generalised solutions have been the bane of

previous attempts at reform and have led to the structural rigidities

that are now part of the problem.   It will be the job of the Project

Manager to check that each Department develops these concepts in the

way that best suits its particular needs, and to indicate how far and

how fast the changes are progressing.

44. The aim should be to establish a quite different way of conducting

the business of government.   The central Civil Service should consist

of a relatively small core engaged in the function of servicing

Ministers and managing Departments who will be the &apos;sponsors&apos; of

particular government policies and services.   Responding to these

Departments will be a range of agencies employing their own staff, who

may or may not have the status of Crown servants, and concentrating on

the delivery of their particular service, with clearly defined

responsibilities between the Secretary of State and the Permanent

Secretary on the one hand and the Chairmen or Chief Executives of the

agencies on the other.   Both Departments and their agencies should have

a more open and simplified structure.

45. The early changes should be in the management tasks at the

centre.   The first new feature should be a Project Manager working on

the planning and early implementation of the service wide changes. As

these come about, the management function at the centre will diminish.

The Cabinet Secretarial and the expenditure functions of the Treasury

will remain and there will still need to be provision at the centre for

determining directions, keeping up pressure on Departments, and setting

standards.   Many of the detailed management functions now carried out

at the centre will disappear, though transitional arrangements will be

needed.   For example the central responsibility for pay and conditions

of service, and the associated negotiations with national Trade Unions,

will be progressively and substantially reduced, though pay

determination will be carried out within running cost controls. The

aim will be to pursue as rapidly as possible an evolutionary approach,

so that the Project Manager harnesses those developments which are

already taking place in some Departments and which are in line with

what is now proposed.

46. Within two years at the most, Departments should have completed

the identification of areas where agencies are the most effective way

of managing and should have changed their own internal structures to

implement this change.   In some cases legislation may be necessary to

effect the change.   Departments will need to move, train and promote

their staff far more flexibly and, where necessary, develop their

specialised management skills while reducing   the existing

establishments and finance functions, as the agencies take full

management responsibility.


47. Once these changes have taken place Ministers and senior civil

servants should have enough confidence in the system they have set up

to be able to concentrate on their proper strategic role of setting the

framework and looking ahead to plan policy development. Greater

freedom to manage should be delegated progressively to individual

agencies, depending on the robustness of the framework and their

capacity to put the freedom to good use.

48. It is difficult to put a figure on the benefits which should

become available from our recommendations but the potential is

obvious.   5% of Civil Service running costs amounted to  630m in 1986/7

and experience elsewhere certainly indicates that when good management

has the opportunity to perform well, percentage improvements larger

than this are achieved.   Where accountability on the lines we suggest

is in place, substantial and quantifiable benefits are coming through.

But a primary aim of the recommended changes is to improve the delivery

of services both to the public and to Ministers.   With total programme

expenditure of  128 billion (1985/6), there is an immense opportunity

to go for substantial improvement in outputs, with better delivery of

services and reduced delays as an alternative to savings.

49. The recommendations we have made should ensure that authority and

responsibility for operations will be clear and Ministers will know who

is accountable to them.   The confusion we observed about the role of

Ministers in management should be substantially resolved. Inevitably

and rightly it is open to a Minister to get involved in any part of his

or her Department&apos;s business, but in a well managed Department this

should normally only be necessary by exception.

50. The substantial gain we are aiming for is the release of

managerial energy.   We want to see managers at all levels in the public

service:

- eager to maximise results

- no longer frustrated or absolved from responsibility by central

constraints

- working with a sense of urgency to improve their service.


ACCOUNTABILITY TO MINISTERS AND PARLIAMENT ON OPERATIONAL MATTERS

1. Evidence we gathered in the scrutiny suggested that when

individuals had to answer personally to Parliament, as well as to

Ministers, their sense of personal responsibility was strengthened.

The accountability of Permanent Secretaries to the Public Accounts

Committee, as Accounting Officers, is long established.   It includes

direct personal accountability for financial propriety. Another

instance of officials having specific functions which may require them

to answer directly to Parliament (though on behalf of their Minister)

is the case of principal officers, and of bodies with independent or

delegated authority, answering to the Select Committee on the

Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.

2. In paragraph 23 we point out that if the concept of agencies

developed in the report is to succeed, some extension of this pattern

of accountability is likely to be necessary.   The principal reasons

are, first, that the management of an agency is unlikely in practice to

be given a realistically specified framework within which there is

freedom to manage if a Minister remains immediately answerable for

every operational detail that may be questioned; and second, that

acceptance of individual responsibility for performance cannot be

expected if repeated ministerial intervention is there as a ready-made

excuse.

3. The precise form of accountability for each agency would need to

be established as part of drawing up the framework for agencies. Any

change from present practice in accountability would, of course, have

to be acceptable to Ministers and to Parliament.   It is axiomatic that

Ministers should remain fully and clearly accountable for policy. For

agencies which are government Departments or parts of Departments

ultimate accountability for operations must also rest with Ministers.

What is needed is the establishment of a convention that heads of

executive agencies would have delegated authority from their Ministers

for operations of the agencies within the framework of policy

directives and resource allocations prescribed by Ministers.   Heads of

agencies would be accountable to Ministers for the operations of their

agencies, but could be called - as indeed they can now - to give

evidence to Select Committees as to the manner in which their delegated

authority had been used and their functions discharged within that

authority.   In the case of agencies established outside departments,

appropriate forms of accountability to Ministers and to Parliament

would need to be established according to the particular circumstances.


4. There is nothing new in the suggestion that Ministers should not be

held answerable for many day-to-day decisions involving the public and

public services.   Apart from services delivered by local authorities,

there are large numbers of central government functions carried out at

arm&apos;s length from Ministers.    The main categories are:

- decisions on individual cases, where these need to be

protected from the risk of political influence, eg tax

cases, social security cases

- some management and executive functions, eg in Customs and

Excise, Regional and District Health Authorities, Manpower

Services Commission (MSC)

- quasi-judicial or regulatory functions, eg Office of Fair Trading,

Immigration Appeals

- nationalised industries.

5. A variety of different structures exists to cover these functions,

for example:

- Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue are non-ministerial

Departments with Boards which have statutory responsibility for

their management.

- The MSC and the other main bodies in the Employment Group

(Health and Safety Executive and ACAS) are non-departmental

public bodies.   The Chairman of the MSC is Accounting Officer for

the MSC&apos;s expenditure.

- HMSO and some other internal service bodies (eg Crown Suppliers)

are established as trading funds and work on a commercial basis.

- the PSA, the Procurement Executive and the NHS Management

Board are agencies within Departments.

- a range of quasi-judicial functions is carried out by statutory

tribunals (eg Rent Tribunals, Industrial Tribunals).

6. Agencies outside Departments generally operate within a statutory

framework which lays down the constitution of the particular agency and

the powers of Ministers in relation to it.     In answer to Parliamentary

questions about matters within the control of the agency Ministers

often preface their reply by saying &quot;I am advised by the Chairman of

the Board that____&quot;.    Most operations currently carried out within

Departments operate under statute.   Where it is necessary to change the

arrangements for formal accountability for operations currently carried

out within Departments, legislation (normally primary legislation)

would generally be required and in instances where this is needed it

should be considered.   Provided that the objective of better management

is clearly explained and understood, and that an appropriate form of

accountability to Ministers and to Parliament is retained, the

government should be able to present such proposals in a positive light.


7. As regards the Public Accounts Committee, as explained in

paragraph 22 of the report, the modification of accountability we

propose should not immediately affect accountability to the PAC. This

would remain, as now, with the Accounting Officer, who may still be,

but need not be, the Permanent Secretary.    (Of the 76 Accounting

Officers appointed by the Treasury, only 18 are First Permanent

Secretaries.)    However, the practice might develop of the Accounting

Officer being accompanied at a PAC hearing by the manager of the

agency.   The Accounting Officer would answer questions about the

framework within which the agency operated; the manager would answer

questions about operations within the framework.    This would give the

PAC the ability to question in detail the person who had first hand

knowledge of the operation in question.   It would also in the process

put a clear pressure on   the agency head to be responsible for his

agency and to strive for good value from his spending.

8. In the case of other Select Committees it is existing practice for

officials with operational responsibility to give evidence before

them.   It would be normal in the future for the agency head to give

evidence before a Select Committee about operational matters within his

or her responsibility.

9. The powers of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration

could continue to apply to agencies, so there would be a direct form of

accountability in matters of maladministration.

10. Quite apart from the issue of improving Civil Service management,

there is a good case for trying to reduce the degree of ministerial

overload that can arise from questions about operations, as distinct

from policy.   For example, Social Security Ministers receive about

15,000 letters a year from MPs, many of which are about individual

cases.   In the future,   MPs could be asked to write about operational

matters directly to the Chairman of the Board or the local office

manager.   This should have the advantage of putting the accountability

clearly on the agency head or local manager, as well as reducing

greatly the amount of correspondence which Ministers have to deal

with.   Arrangements of this sort could be promulgated by a letter from

the relevant Minister or the Leader of the House to all MPs.   (In the

past the Chancellor of the Exchequer has written to all MPs asking them

to refer questions about constituents&apos; tax to local tax offices, and

the Secretary of State for Social Services has written similarly about

referring social security cases to DHSS local office managers.)   If an

MP writes to an operational manager about matters which are essentially

political, it is already normal practice for the manager to refer the

letter to the Minister.

11. It would be part of the framework drawn up between the Department

and the agency to have specific targets for promptness in dealing with

correspondence with MPs.   It should be possible for MPs to get a

quicker answer when dealing direct with the responsible person, because

the intermediate stage of a Headquarters branch calling for a report

from a local manager before drafting a reply for the Minister will have

been cut out.


ANNEX 2

FINDINGS

1. This annex sets out the main findings from our fieldwork.

2. Our terms of reference asked us:

- to assess progress in improving management

- to identify successful measures in changing attitudes

and practices

- to identify obstacles to better management and efficiency

that remain

- to report to the Prime Minister on what further measures

should be taken

I. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

3. Our main findings are that:

- some progress has been made: civil servants are now more cost

conscious, and management systems are in place

- budgeting systems and manpower cuts are the two measures which

have been most effective in changing attitudes and practices

- but substantial obstacles to further progress remain:

. there is insufficient focus on the delivery of government

services (as opposed to policy and ministerial support),

even though 95% of civil servants work in service delivery

or executive functions

. there is a shortage of management skills and of experience

of working in service delivery functions amongst senior

civil servants

. short-term political priorities tend to squeeze out long-

term planning

. there is too much emphasis on spending money, and not

enough on getting results

. the Civil Service is too big and too diverse to manage

as a single organisation.

- while the introduction of systems is a start, real changes in

attitudes and institutions are needed to get the full benefits

of better management.

4. The findings from our fieldwork about obstacles to progress are

consistent with the main themes which come out of earlier scrutinies.

They also echo the findings of some earlier reports on the Civil

Service, eg the Fulton Report (Appendix A).


II. DETAILED FINDINGS

5. We held extensive discussions with civil servants in London and

the regions.   A list of those we saw and where we went is in Annex 3.

A. PROGRESS IN IMPROVING MANAGEMENT

6. Everybody we talked to said that there had been progress. Most

people were enthusiastic about measures which gave them more

responsibility and some control over how they did their job. They

welcomed the principles of the Financial Management Initiative, if not

always the way the principles were applied.

7. A striking impression we got was that most civil servants now know

how much their activities cost.   The local office manager has at his

fingertips his staffing, accommodation and other costs; the

Headquarters policy Grade 5 can tell you the cost of his unit.

8. When asked what they meant by progress, most people identified FMI

and the systems developed under it (top management systems and

budgeting systems) as the main difference.   They also commented on

changes in personnel management systems, particularly linking open

appraisal of performance with the achievement of objectives.

Top Management Systems

9. All Departments now have Top Management Systems.   These systems

are intended to force management at all levels to take clear decisions

about the direction of activities in a Department. Strategic

objectives can then be translated down the line to provide individuals

with personal objectives.

10. Our evidence suggests that Top Management Systems are seen as

having more relevance in executive functions and in the regions, than

in Headquarters   or policy functions.   One good example we saw was the

use of MINIS in DOE regional offices.   The system is precise and

directed towards things which matter in the outside world (not just

internal bureaucratic processes).   There are good systems of delegation

to go with it.   The Grade 7 in a regional office handling claims for

derelict land grant has a minute from his Permanent Secretary telling

him precisely what his delegated authority is.   One Grade 7 we talked

to said &quot;having a personal minute from the Permanent Secretary really

brought it home to me that I was responsible&quot;.

11. There was more scepticism in some Headquarters and policy

divisions about the value of Top Management Systems as they were being

operated.   Very few people said to us that setting objectives did not

apply to policy work.    However, in many Departments it was not clear

how far the use of management systems had become an integral part of

the work of policy divisions, rather than a one-off form filling

exercise.   A number of people commented on the weight of paper


surrounding the systems and the number of forms to be filled in - or as

one person said &quot;typical Civil Service: management has been

bureaucratised&quot;.   We heard trenchant views in some Departments,

especially from Grades 5-7, about the absence of feedback from top

management, and the failure of top management to face the decisions

which the systems confronted them with.

Budgeting Systems

12. All Departments now have budgeting systems which delegate

financial responsibility to specified levels of authority in the

hierarchy.   This gives managers some control over how they spend the

money allocated to them.   Over 7,000 line managers now manage budgets

which account for about three quarters of the Civil Service&apos;s running

costs.

13. The range of costs covered and the flexibility allowed within

budgets vary from Department to Department.   For example, Customs and

Excise Collectors have authority over 96% of their running costs and

authority to switch money between one item and another.   In practice,

however, staffing costs amount to about 70% of running costs and the

margin in which managers have immediate flexibility is very small. A

persistent complaint of budget holders was the inflexibility caused by

the annuality rule, and by restrictions on their ability to move money

between different items.   (These are dealt with in paragraphs 46 and 49

below.)

14. Budgeting has been applied mainly to administrative expenditure

(some 13% of total public expenditure).   Its spread into programme

spending has been slow.

Personnel management systems

15. The main changes in personnel management in the last 5 years have

been:

a. the introduction of an open appraisal system based on

reviewing performance against personal objectives

b. the development of performance related pay

c. the prospect of a new pay agreement with professional

civil servants which offers much greater flexibility

d. more delegation of clerical recruitment to local office

managers

e. the introduction of unified grading down to Grade 7

(Principal) level

16. Appraisal systems are now based on performance, not on the

possession of particular intellectual qua 1ities.   Everybody we spoke to

welcomed this.   Most people like having a clear set of objectives which

tells them what they are there to do and having their performance

judged against whether they achieved these objectives - not against

some hidden agenda in their manager&apos;s bottom drawer.   Open reporting

encourages managers to talk about an individual&apos;s performance face-to-

face.

21


17. Two schemes for relating pay to performance have been developed.

First, an experimental performance bonus scheme was introduced in

1985.    A formal evaluation after the first year showed that while the

bonus scheme in its present form had not been successful, 70% of civil

servants supported the principle of rewarding good performance with

better pay.   Second, the Treasury and the MPO are now developing

proposals for discretionary pay for staff at all levels.

B. MEASURES EFFECTIVE IN CHANGING ATTITUDES AND PRACTICES

18. The two measures which have had most effect in altering the

climate and the way the Civil Service works are manpower cuts and

budgeting.

Manpower cuts

19. As a result of government policy, the Civil Service was reduced in

size by nearly 15% between 1979 and 1984.   It will have been reduced by

nearly 20% by 1 April 1987.   The cuts were imposed as simple outline

targets.   Departments then had to decide how to reach the targets.

There is evidence that in some Departments top management was forced to

take hard decisions about whether to continue particular activities,

and to think about different ways of doing things.   So the cuts were

useful in making some Departments &quot;think the unthinkable&quot;.    In other

Departments, however, cuts were imposed across the board, without

regard to the functions affected.    A view we heard in a number of

Departments was that the manpower cuts had &quot;taken the fat out of the

system&quot; and that further large reductions would harm the quality of

services delivered by government.

20. Controls on running costs were introduced in 1985/86 on top of

manpower controls.     We saw a number of examples where the control on

staff in post on 1 April together with controls on cash were causing

distortions.   One local office manager was running down his staffing

levels at the end of the year by 12 people to meet his 1 April

headcount limit.   In early April he planned to recruit another 10

people.   He had enough money in his budget to have kept 6/7 people on

over the year end.

21. In the course of our scrutiny the Treasury announced that from 1

April 1988 formal controls on manpower would be lifted, and the main

control on Departments would be exercised on running cost totals.

Budgeting systems

22. Where budgeting systems are working well there is evidence that

they change the way people behave.   Specifically they enable budget

holders to save money or make better use of  money; and encourage

forward planning of activities and spending, and setting of priorities.

22


C. OBSTACLES TO FURTHER PROGRESS

23. The main concern of most people we met was with the obstacles

which stood in the way of management improvement.

a) Top management is dominated by the policy and political support

tasks

24. The business of top managers in many Departments is still

dominated by the policy and political support tasks.   However 95% of

civil servants (about 570,000, costing some  12 billion a year) are

involved in collecting taxes, paying benefits, providing support to the

armed forces and other executive functions.   Some of the operations are

very large.   In DHSS, for example, over 80,000 staff are involved in

paying benefits.   It was made clear to us that these organisations need

highly skilled top managers who can devote most of their time to the

business of running them.   One top manager of a very large executive

organisation told us that at present 90% of his time was spent dealing

with Ministers and other pressures from the top and only 10% on

managing the organisation.

25. The skills of top civil servants are still policy oriented.

Promotion to senior jobs is given to those whose main skills and

experience are in policy and ministerial support.   Very few have had

direct experience of management in large executive organisations. This

is reflected when senior civil servants are suddenly put in positions

which do have management responsibilities.   Either they neglect

management, because the immediate pressures are to deal with day-to-day

ministerial business; or they go about the management task in a way

which lacks confidence and conviction.    Many people commented to us

that too few senior civil servants showed the qualities of leadership

which would be expected from top managers in organisations outside the

Civil Service.

26. The Top Management Programme, a six week training course, is an

attempt to change the balance of skills of those entering the senior

ranks of the Civil Service.   But it is not a substitute for real

experience of running an organisation.   At middle levels the Senior

Management Development Programme sets out a range of individual

&quot;competencies&quot; which should be developed through job experience and

training.   The first two core competencies are management of

resources/organisations and the management of staff. There are few

indications so far that the perception that middle ranking civil

servants should get management experience has affected the way

Departments post their staff.

27. The younger staff we spoke to told us that they wanted to get

experience of management.   The FDA confirmed that ATs and HEODs were

clamouring for management jobs.    Departments agreed in principle that

younger staff and fast streamers should get management experience, but

said that in practice they could not spare their good staff from policy

jobs.    There is an automatic assumption that fast streamers go into

Private Office jobs, but no equivalent assumption that they should also

do management jobs.    The majority of the next generation of senior

civil servants will still not have been tested in or gained experience

from working in large service delivery organisations.

23


b) Responsibilities for management at the top of Departments are

unclear

28. Most Ministers told us that they were answerable for both the

policy and the management of their Departments.    But they said that in

practice they were so overloaded that they looked to their Permanent

Secretaries to do the management.   A few said candidly that they did

not have the skills to manage their Departments.    The government has

accepted the recommendation of the Third Report of the Treasury and

Civil Service Select Committee (1982) that the relationship between

Ministers and Permanent Secretaries on the management of Departments

should be clarified, but has not yet acted on it.

c) The main pressures at the top are short term

29. The main pressures on Ministers stem from Parliament and coping

with crises.   Together with routine business from Departments this

creates an extremely heavy workload.    In addition Ministers have

Parliamentary and constituency duties.    The resulting overload tends

to squeeze out the ability to look to the long term.    Some Ministers

said to us that they would like to be able to spend more of their time

dealing with longer-term strategy, but just did not have the time to do

so.

30. The pressures on Ministers are reflected onto top civil servants,

who may have to spend much of their time giving policy and

presentational advice to their Ministers.

31. It was suggested that whilst there were some tasks which Ministers

could not delegate to officials, there were others where this could be

done.   One example was dealing with correspondence from MPs.

Correspondence about individual cases could in many cases be dealt with

effectively by local office managers.

d) Outputs are neglected

32. Whilst the introduction of management systems has helped make

civil servants cost conscious, there is less consciousness about

results.   Departments regard the major central influence on them as the

PES process.   However, many people told us that the PES system gave the

wrong signals.   They felt that the emphasis was on inputs, not outputs

or value for money.

33. This is not surprising.   The Treasury has two goals with the PES

round: to ensure that public spending does not exceed a specified total

and to press Departments to achieve maximum output from the resources

they are allocated.   The two are not mutually exclusive, but as the PES

round progresses, attention inevitably focuses on the absolute levels

of spending.   Furthermore, at the later stages, the debate is about

spending at the margin of the total bid.   The combination of these two

factors - emphasis on inputs and &quot;marginality&quot; - leads Departments to

feel that although increased stress is being put on results and

outputs, it is inputs which still really matter.

24


34. There are, however, encouraging signs of change.   The 1986 Public

Expenditure White Paper included 1200 output measures; the 1987 White

Paper cites some 1800 measures of output.   The April 1987 guidelines

for PES will ask Departments to provide the Treasury with a full

statement of output and performance measures to support their baseline

expenditure.   These will be discussed between the Treasury and

Departments.   Any proposals for additional resources must be supported

by information on what indicators and targets for outputs will be used

to evaluate their use.

35. There are also some signs in particular areas of government of an

increasing awareness of the importance of outputs.    For example, in

1986 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office undertook a scrutiny of

existing output measures to see to what extent they could be improved

and applied systematically to the full range of work of the FCO at home

and overseas.

36. It is apparent that the closer staff are to the sharp end, the

more conscious they are of outputs.   In many areas staff are strongly

motivated by a wish to serve the public.   A common source of

frustration in many local offices is the inadequacy of the service

staff feel they are giving.   Our evidence suggests that very few

Departments set themselves formal targets for improving the quality of

service to the public.

e) There is little support or pressure for value for money

37. Most pressures on government are to spend money, not to get good

value from it.   Parliament and the media often reinforce this by

judging the government on how much money goes in, not what comes out

(eg more hospitals, or better education).   The National Audit Office

(NAO) now has a specific remit to do value for money investigations.

For example, it has looked at value for money in the National Health

Service.   However, the response of Departments to the NAO and the

Public Accounts Committee tends to be cautious and defensive, probably

because the main role of these bodies is seen as being to find fault

with what has happened in the past rather than to apply pressure for

improvement for the future.

f) The organisation at the centre of government is fragmented

38. Many of those to whom we spoke, particularly Permanent Secretaries,

told us that the centre of government was fragmented.   They complained

that the centre, either the Treasury, the MPO, or the various central

units, pursued their own initiatives without regard to Departments&apos; own

priorities; and that sometimes the messages from the centre

conflicted.   There was no single voice of authority.

39. At the same time the centre created little effective pressure on

Departments to deliver better results.    Some people suggested to us

that the centre&apos;s reliance on detailed control of the way Departments

organised and managed themselves was totally at odds with the

principles of good delegated management as set out in the FMI.

25


g) The Civil Service is too big and too diverse to be run as a

single rigid organisation

40. The Civil Service is vast (600,000 people) and the diversity of

activities which civil servants perform is immense.   Yet it is run as

one organisation with common rules for financial management and

personnel management.

41. One problem inherent in trying to bind a very large and diverse

organisation in one set of central rules is that the rules fit no

particular part of the organisation.    For example, a service wide pay

agreement to give certain computer specialists an extra allowance may

be what one Department needs to retain those specialists, but simply an

unwelcome addition to running costs for another which has no difficulty

at all in keeping them.

42. Civil Service wide grading and promotion structures create

problems for some Departments.   For example, there is no direct

recruitment above E0 level.   The structural needs of some Departments

are to take staff in at a higher level.

43. All recruitment above clerical level is conducted centrally by the

Civil Service Commission (with the exception of some limited

experiments in direct recruitment of Executive Officers by

Departments).    The personal qualities which DHSS requires for its

Executive Officers, who may be dealing with the public in a local

office or investigating benefit fraud, are very different from the

qualities required of an E0 for a Whitehall policy job. Some

Departments told us that central recruitment prevented them from

getting the staff they wanted, though the Civil Service Commission is

now attempting to distinguish the different types of quality needed

amongst recruits at E0 level.

44. The justification for service wide terms and conditions has

traditionally been in terms of ensuring fairness between different

groups of people doing the same work, and making it possible for people

to move easily between Departments.   Evidence we gathered suggests that

many groups of staff in the Civil Service are doing very different

types of work; and that most staff spend their career within their own

Department.

h) Central rules take away the flexibility managers need to manage

45. Many managers told us that central rules were acting as a

constraint on good management and taking away their scope to do things

which would be sensible in terms of their own organisation.

46. One example of a rule constraining good management which was

mentioned to us by nearly all budget holders we met was annuality - the

lack of flexibility at the end of the financial year to carry unspent

money over or to anticipate next year&apos;s spending.   This has two

effects.   First, there is often a major effort to spend money in the

final months of the year so as not to be underspent.   Last minute

spending often means spending on things which are useful, but not a top

priority.   Second, a huge management effort goes into coming in on

budget.   In 1985/86 Customs and Excise underspent a budget of  400m by

only  40,000.

26


47. Most people accept that controls on Departments&apos; running costs are

effective and necessary.    However, the reliance on gross running cost

controls has caused problems for some fee-earning businesses: when

demand has grown for their services, they have been prevented from

taking on more staff to cope with demand, even though the extra cost

would have been met from increased fee revenue.   This is an area where

it has been shown possible to change the controls.   For example, from 1

April 1987 the Driver Testing and Training Organisation of the

Department of Transport will be moved to a new financial regime which

will enable the Department to recruit more examiners to cope with the

increased demand.   One effect in the past of being unable to take on

extra staff to meet increased demand was queues for driving tests of

six months or more in some areas.

48. A further problem mentioned to us was that of hidden controls.

The best example is the use by the Treasury of an inadequate assumption

for pay increases when setting running cost totals.   In the last six

years the Treasury has reached the pay settlement after the start of

the financial year, and in each year the actual settlement has been at

least 1.3% higher than the pay assumption.   Departments have had to

fund the difference.

49. Sometimes the &quot;central&quot; rules about which managers complained to

us are rules imposed by the centre of their own Departments (eg Finance

Branches), not rules imposed by the Treasury or OMCS.    For example,

there are marked differences in the flexibility which budget holders in

different Departments have to move money from one item to another.

The main rule imposed by the Treasury is that there should be no

movement of money from non-running costs to running costs.   Rules about

moving money between different running costs items are generally

imposed by Departments themselves.

i)   Delegation is not always happening

50. Most people we met welcomed delegation where it was happening.

However, many pointed out to us the strong pressures which acted

against effective delegation:

the public accountabilities of Departments through

Ministers to Parliament tend to suck up decisions on

matters of detail

central controls, whether from the centre of the Civil

Service or the centre of Departments, restrict people&apos;s

ability to operate (eg a manager may have money in his

budget to buy a photocopier, but a central branch in his

Department has laid down rules which prevent him from having

the machine)

civil servants are generally reluctant to risk delegating and

do not understand that interference in detail destroys

effective delegation.   We saw examples in the budgetary

field, where at the first sign of trouble in a particular

area the reaction of the centre of the Department had been

to draw back responsibility from all budget holders instead

of getting the difficulties of the individual area sorted

out.

27


j)   The culture of the Civil Service is cautious and works against

personal responsibility

51. The culture of the Civil Service puts a premium on a &quot;safe pair of

hands&quot;, not on enterprise.   It does not reward the person who says &quot;I

have saved money&quot;. It does not penalise the person who ignores the

opportunity to get better value.

52. There will always be limits on individual ownership when civil

servants are fulfilling their ministerial support function. However,

more could be done within the existing framework to encourage personal

responsibility.   The group of people who had left the Civil Service all

told us that while pay was an important reason for leaving, as

important was the fact that they had had little personal

responsibility, and saw little prospect of getting more as they rose

through the hierarchy.

k)   Working and career patterns have changed relatively little

53. The working patterns of Departments have changed relatively little

in the last seven years.   Chains of command still tend to be long;

little use is made of special task forces to cut across hierarchies and

to take policies forward in a given timescale; the emphasis on

consultation across various interests in a Department is always time

consuming and often leads to compromise decisions; the system is still

paper dominated; there is insufficient awareness of the possibilities

of information technology in Whitehall Departments.

54. Departments have paid insufficient attention to managing

relationships with organisations who are delivering services.   In some

cases the relationship is direct; in other cases indirect (as with

local authorities).   In both cases Departments have the ability to

control or influence the delivery of services.   A number of Departments

are beginning to take this task more seriously.   In the DHSS a

Division, headed by a Grade 3, is responsible for managing the

relationship with the National Health Service.   This includes, for

example, performance reviews with Regional Health Authorities.

55. The career pattern of civil servants is relatively predictable

through the hierarchy.   In practice seniority is usually a requirement

for promotion at certain levels (for example, very few people are

promoted to Grade 5 under the age of 35).     It is almost unheard of for

people of that age to be promoted to the top grades in the Civil

Service.   One Permanent Secretary argued to us that the Service should

have the courage and the flexibility to promote the occasional

outstanding young person very fast.

28


III. CONCLUSIONS

56.    The changes which civil servants are most aware of are the

introduction of systems.   There is enthusiasm for the benefits the

systems can bring in terms of greater flexibility, more personal

responsibility, and more precision about what the job is they are there

to do.   At the same time many civil servants question whether the

underlying assumptions which mould the way in which government does its

business have changed sufficiently to realise the benefits.      The key

themes which emerge as obstacles in the way of real change are:

(i) the lack of focus of top management on the service delivery

and executive functions of government

(ii) the effects of treating the Civil Service as a single

organisation

(iii) the lack of effective pressure to get better results.


APPENDIX A

PREVIOUS REPORTS ON THE CIVIL SERVICE

General

1. The Northcote-Trevelyan report (1854) identified for the first

time some of the principles which underlie the development of the

modern Civil Service.   Its main recommendations fell into four

categories:

a. recruitment by competitive examination rather than

patronage

b. a division between intellectual and mechanical work

c. promotion by merit

d. measures to unify the Civil Service, including a common

basis of recruiting across Departments

2. It took nearly 20 years to implement open competition.   The other

principles of the Report were not fully developed and applied until the

1920s.     Commissions after Northcote-Trevelyan up to 1931* and the

Reconstruction Period immediately following the First World War

established the basis of the Civil Service for the next 45 years.

These developments included uniform systems of recruitment; the class

division of officials; Whitley machinery; and the central power of the

Treasury over the Civil Service.

3. From 1931 until the establishment of the Fulton Committee in 1966,

there was no major Commission on the Civil Service as a whole (the

Priestley Commission in 1953/55 was largely concerned with pay).

4. The Fulton Report (1968) recognised the need for the Civil Service

to change in line with the changed external world.   Its opening words

were:   &quot;The Home Civil Service today is still fundamentally the product

of the nineteenth-century philosophy of the Northcote-Trevelyan

Report.   The tasks it faces today are those of the second half of the

twentieth century&quot;.

5. The Committee noted six main deficiencies which it attributed to

the fact that the structures and practices of the Civil Service had not

kept up with changing tasks:

the Service was based on the philosophy of the amateur

the division into classes made for a cumbersome structure

specialists had no authority

too few civil servants were skilled managers

Whitehall had too little contact with the outside world

there were deficiencies in personnel management.

* The Playfair Commission (1874-1875), The Ridley Commission

(1886-1890); The MacDonnell Commission (1912-1915), The Tomlin

Commission (1929-1931)

30


6. The Report set down one basic principle, which was intended to

ensure that the Civil Service should keep up with the changing world:

&quot;One basic guiding principle should in our view govern the

future development of the Civil Service.   It applies to any

organisation and is simple to the point of banality, but the

root of much of our criticism is that it has not been observed.

The principle is: look at the job first.   The Civil Service must

continuously review the tasks it is called upon to perform and

the possible ways in which it might perform them; it should then

think out what new skills and kinds of men are needed, and how

these men can be found, trained and deployed.   The Service must

avoid a static view of a new ideal man and structure which in its

turn could become as much of an obstacle to change as the present

inheritance.&quot;

7. Fulton recommended that the principles of accountable management

should be introduced into the Civil Service, and recommended further

study of &quot;hiving off&quot; functions as a means to ensuring accountable

management.   In the meanwhile the report made proposals

&quot;a.   to distinguish those within Departments whose primary

responsibility is planning for the future, from those

whose main concern is the operation of existing policies

or the provision of services;

&quot;b.   to establish in Departments forms of organisation and

principles of accountable management, by which individuals

and branches can be held responsible for objectively

measured performance.&quot;

8. Other significant Fulton recommendations were for the creation of

a Civil Service Department and the Civil Service College; and unified

grading between administrators and professional groups.

9. The major reports on the management of the Civil Service after

Fulton were the Eleventh Report for the Expenditure Committee (1977)

and the Third Report of the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee

&quot;Efficiency and Effectiveness in the Civil Service&quot; (1982).   Lack of

accountable management was as a common theme of both these reports.


ANNEX 3

TERMS OF REFERENCE AND WORKING METHOD

Terms of reference

1. The terms of reference for the scrutiny were:

- to assess the progress achieved in improving management in the

Civil Service;

- to identify what measures have been successful in changing

attitudes and practices;

- to identify the institutional, administrative, political and

attitudinal obstacles to better management and efficiency that

still remain; and

- to report to the Prime Minister on what further measures should be

taken.

2. The scrutiny was carried out under the supervision of Sir Robin

Ibbs by three members of the Efficiency Unit (Kate Jenkins, Karen

Caines and Andrew Jackson).   Other members of the Unit (Graham Cawsey,

David Tune and Richard Hirst) joined in the fieldwork and specific

studies.

3. The Action Manager for the scrutiny was Sir Robert Armstrong (now

Sir Robin Butler).

I

Timetable

4. The scrutiny started on 3 November 1986 and was completed on 20

March 1987 (90 working days).

Method of working

5. The evidence on which the report is based is derived from:

- interviews with Ministers and a wide range of officials

- field visits to regional and local offices, and some major

installations outside London

- a cross section of past scrutinies undertaken with the help of

the Efficiency Unit

- studies of three organisations outside government and discussions

with a number of outside observers of Whitehall

32


Interviews-

6. We conducted over 150 individual interviews with Ministers and

officials in Whitehall, including:

. 21 Ministers

. 26 Permanent Secretaries (or equivalent), including

all Permanent Secretary heads of major Departments

. 26 Grade 2s (1 or 2 in most Departments)

7. In addition we held a number of group discussions:

 

. 5 for grade 3s   (involving 35 people)

. 7 for grades 5-7 (involving over 50 people)

. 1 for Heads of Treasury Expenditure Groups

8. We talked to a group of people who had left the Civil Service

recently.

Field trips to regional and other offices

9. We talked to meetings of Regional Directors of the following

Departments:

Departments of Environment and Transport

Property Services Agency

Department of Employment

Manpower Services Commission

Department of Health and Social Security

Department of Trade and Industry

Inland Revenue

10. Members of the Efficiency Unit made a series of visits to regional

and local offices in Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds.

11. In our visits to Birmingham and Manchester we talked to staff at

various levels in the regional offices of the following Departments:

Departments of Environment and Transport (Manchester)

Property Services Agency (Birmingham)

Department of Employment (Birmingham)

Department of Health and Social Security (Birmingham)

Customs and Excise (Manchester)

12. In Leeds we talked to the Regional Directors of Departments to get

a view of the links between Departments.    We visited the following

offices:

Departments of the Environment and Transport

Property Services Agency

Department of Employment

Manpower Services Commission

Department of Health and Social Security

Department of Trade and Industry

Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department

Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food

Export Credits Guarantee Department

33


13. We visited the following local offices and talked widely with

staff:

DHSS ILO (Erdington)

Inland Revenue (Birmingham, Newcastle)

DE Unemployment Benefit Office (Birmingham, Newcastle)

Customs and Excise (Birmingham Airport)

Manpower Services Commission (Birmingham)

14. We  visited the following large installations outside London and

talked to staff at all levels:

Inland Revenue, Telford Development Centre

DHSS North Fylde Central Office

DHSS Newcastle Central Office

RAF Support Command Headquarters (RAF Brampton)

Scrutinies

15. Over 300 scrutinies have been conducted since 1979.   Their reports

provide valuable evidence about change in the Civil Service over the

last 7 years and a detailed view of some of the workings of particular

aspects of individual Departments.   A special survey of a cross section

of 50 scrutinies was undertaken to draw out the lessons for this

scrutiny.

Organisations outside Government

16. Members of the Unit visited the following organisations to look at

major management changes which had been brought about in the last few

years.   Each organisation is essentially a career organisation:

British Rail (Network SouthEast)

Halifax Building Society

ICI Fibres Division

Central Reports

17. The Unit has kept closely in touch with developments in the

Treasury and Cabinet Office (OMCS), in particular over progress on

personnel management changes and the implementation of the Wilson

report on Budgeting.    We have also examined previous reports on the

management of the Civil Service.

Trade Unions

18. We held two formal meetings with the Council of Civil Service

Unions.

Cost of the scrutiny

19. The estimated cost of the scrutiny was  50,000.

Annex B

MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE

Next  Steps:     Establishing and Administering Agencies

INTRODUCTION

This note sets out the steps to be taken by those

responsible for the management of executive functions in

Departments in setting up agencies. It describes the

arrangements for the establishment of the great majority of

agencies which will remain within the Civil Service;

modifications will have to be considered case by case for non-

Civil Service agencies. The arrangements will be kept under

review and modified as necessary in the light of experience. No

change affecting expenditure controls or pay controls as they

exist at present will be introduced into the operational

management of the agencies without the specific agreement of the

Treasury. Similarly, changes in recruitment procedures must have

the agreement of the Office of the Minister for the Civil Service

(OMCS) .

2. Subject to these essential safeguards, the Treasury and

the OMCS hope to be able to work closely with Departments in a

constructive and flexible way so as to encourage the exercise of

responsibility and the release of energies which it is the

purpose of the &apos;Next Steps&apos; recommendations to achieve. As

alternative procedures are developed and tested, it should prove

possible progressively to relax some of the conventional

controls, including some of the more detailed arrangements set &amp;

out   in  this  note.     Both   the  central  Departments  will,   of course,

be    ready    to    give    any    further    advice    or    help    they    can to

Departments  contemplating  setting up agencies.

3. -The Project Manager will be responsible for assisting with

the process of setting up the new agencies, for promoting the

resolution of any difficulties that arise in the course of that

process, and for ensuring that the establishment of each agency

is successfully completed within whatever  time-scale  is agreed.

Identification

4. Provisional identification of potential agencies will be

the responsibility of Departments, or Treasury Expenditure

Divisions. The criteria will develop over time in the light of

experience with the pilot agencies, but common features will be

that  the prospective agencies  are,  or can be made:

a. discrete  administrative  units,   sufficient   in size to

justify major  structural change;

b. wholly   concerned   with   the   delivery   of   services to

the public  or  the Government;

c. independently accountable within their parent s.

Areas of work where the day-to-day involvement of the Department

or its Minister is inevitable, or where policy and its execution

are inextricably linked, are unlikely to be suitable candidates

for agency  treatment,  at  least initially.

Alternatives  to Agency Status

5. In initial consideration of potential agencies, the parent

Department should consider the following alternatives:

a. Privatisation

Privatisation provides all the managerial freedoms and

disciplines    sought    by    the   agency   approach,    and should

&apos;normally be regarded as the preferred route unless there

are compelling reasons to the contrary. If privatisation

is not immediately practicable, but might become so later

on,   the  Department  will  consider  whether  agency treatment

-is  an appropriate transitional measure;

&apos; &apos;

2

MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE


MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE

b. Contractorisatlon

If it Is decided that a particular block of work is not a

candidate for immediate privatisation in its entirety,

consideration should be given to contracting out its

management  to  the private sector;

c .        Public Corporations

Large executive operations which already have an arm&apos;s

length relationship with their parent Departments may be

candidates for conversion into public corporations,

especially where they are currently established as Trading

Funds, whether under the 1973 Act or otherwise. This may

be  a  good  route  to  eventual privatisation.

d. Abolition

Closer examination of particular services as part of the

preparation for setting up any agency may call into

question whether they are needed at all, and, if so,

whether their provision needs to be organised as a

separate activity of the Department.

Analys is

6. Once    a    Department   has    satisfied    itself    that    the work

concerned is prima facie suitable for agency treatment, it will

need to carry out a more rigorous analysis. The essential facts

to be brought  out  at  this  stage are:

a. the prospective agency&apos;s aims and objectives, and

the  functions  to be covered;

b. the adequacy of the agency&apos;s internal management and

financial systems;

c. the type of organisation best suited to ensure the

desired results;

3

MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE


MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE

d. the benefits  sought  from the agency approach;

e. the resources currently employed in the areas to be

covered by the agency;

f. the inputs/outputs/unit costs now achieved in those

areas;  and proposed changes;

g. any new or modified functions to be carried out by

the agency;

h. existing  and  planned  performance measures;

i. the pay and expenditure regime;

j.        the state of  industrial relations within the agency;

k.        any legislation likely to be required;

1. the arrangements for answerability to Parliament and

individual Members;

Departmental Approval

7. Assuming that the analysis is satisfactory and does not

suggest that immediate privatisation or some other structure

would be a better solution, the Department will submit outline

proposals  to  its  own Minister.

First  Stage Review

8. The Department will discuss its outline proposals with the

Project Manager. The Treasury will then consider the outline

scheme,, paying particular attention to the proposed pay, running

4

MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE


MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE

cost and public expenditure control arrangements, and any

possible repercussive effects within the public service and the

economy generally. Other Departments and agencies likely to be

directly or  indirectly affected will be  consulted  at   this stage.

Preparation of Framework

9. The    Department,    will    draw   up    the    key    elements    of the

policy and resources framework for the agency. The framework

will set out:

a. the relationship with the Department, including the

circumstances in which the Minister will issue directions

to the agency, and the extent to, and the arrangements

under, which the agency will contribute to policy

formation;

b. the agency&apos;s aims and objectives;

c. the conventions which the Department would wish to

establish regarding answerability to Parliament and

individual Members  on  the  activities  of   the agency.

d. the nature of the resources to be provided, and of

the outputs to be achieved, and how they are to be

measured;

e. the machinery for accounting, audit, monitoring and

reporting,  both within government  and externally;

f. the arrangements for setting objectives and

financial targets for the agency, where appropriate, and

the  arrangements  for  their periodic revision;

g. the expenditure classification and control

mechanisms agreed with the Treasury for the agency when

first established and any change which might be proposed

subsequently;

5

MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE


MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE

h. arrangements for recruitment, pay, and other

personnel management responsibilities, and the extent to

which  these are  delegated  to  the agencies.

i. the expenditure provision proposed for the agency in

its first year, and the scale of the savings and

performance  improvements  expected subsequently.

j. the terms  of reference  for  the Chief Executive;

i. the method of recruitment and basis of

remuneration for the Chief Executive and his key

staff;

ii. reporting       arrangements        for        the Chief

Execu t ive;

k.        the  Industrial relations structure.

Approval  of Framework

10. The framework as agreed with the Treasury and OMCS will be

submitted to the departmental Minister for approval. It will be

for the Minister to clear his framework with the Chancellor of

the Exchequer, the Minister of State Privy Council Office, and,

as necessary,   the Prime Minister.

Staff Interests

&apos; t

11. &apos;The Department, in consultation with the Treasury, will

consider when and how to consult its departmental trade unions on

arrangements for staff representation; the conduct of industrial

relations within the agency, including the establishment of

Whitley, machinery, and its relationship with the Departmental

Whitley Council; and any proposed changes in terms and conditions

of service.

6

MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE


MANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCE

Legislation

12. Any necessary legislation should if practicable be

introduced at this stage. If that would unacceptably delay the

implementation timetable the agency may have to be set up with a

temporary framework within existing powers. A note on the

legislative implications of the &quot;Next Steps&quot; approach in relation

to Parliamentary financial control is available; this has been

drawn up by the Treasury in consultation with the Treasury

Solicitor&apos;s Department.

IMPLEMENTATION

Recruitment  of  Chief  Executive  and  Key Staff

13. The terms of appointment and the terms and conditions of

employment of the Chief Executive and, where appropriate, his key

staff will be agreed between the Department, the Treasury and the

OMCS. The Prime Minister will need to be consulted at this

stage about the more important appointments. Appointment will be

by either:

a. Open competition on fixed contract; existing civil

servants would be free to apply, but, if appointed, on

terms providing substantially higher rewards than normal

scales might be required to resign from the career Civil

Service. Reinstatement at the end of the contract would

be a possibility, but there would be no guaranteed right

of return; or

b. Internal selection:

i. from within  the Department; or

ii. by Service-wide advertisement.

7

MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE


MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE

Those appointed by this method would continue to be

subject to Civil Service pay and conditions, including

eligibility for performance related increments, and any

agreed bonus arrangements.

All   agency   staff   (including   the   Chief   Executive)   will,    at any

rate initially, be civil  servants,  the main difference between

the   two   methods   of   appointment   being   that   method   a.   will offer

high   rewards   in   return   for   high   risks,   while   method   b. will

balance  lower remuneration against  greater  security  of tenure.

Performance  of  Chief Executive

14. The essence of the &quot;Next Steps&quot; approach is that the

agency&apos;s responsibility for delivering the agreed services in

accordance with the framework should rest squarely on the Chief

Executive. He or she can only be absolved from that

responsibility by certain actions of the Department (eg by

failing to provide the agreed resources) or by some form of force

maj eure.

15. The Chief Executive&apos;s remit must set out precisely what is

expected of him and the circumstances in which performance

related awards will be given and penalties, including termination

of appointment, enforced. Drawing up *satisfactory contracts of

this kindfor outside appointments is extremely difficult, and the

assistance of the Department&apos;s legal advisers should be sought

from the outset.

16. Chief Executives and other agency staff would be subject

to the Civil Service Pay and Conditions of Service Code.

Sanctions against an under-performing Chief Executives or key

staff  on  fixed  term contracts would include:

a. Termination of contract. This is unlikely to be a

practical remedy except in cases of gross incompetence or

impropriety;

b. non-renewal of contract; and

8

MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE


MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE

c.        withholding or reduction of any terminal bonuses.

17. The Prime Minister should be consulted where it is

proposed to terminate the contract of a Chief Executive whose

original  appointment  was  approved by her.

Assessment  of performance

18. The judgement on whether or not a Chief Executive has met

the agreed targets for costs and performance should rest in the

first instance with the agency&apos;s parent Department. The

assessment will be made by the Permanent Secretary after

consultation with the departmental Minister. It may well be

necessary to provide for a formal appeal procedure where an

adverse assessment leads to termination of contract; possible

options, which would be written into the contract and would

depend on the status of the Chief Executive concerned, would

include appeal to:

a. the Head of  the Home Civil Service;

b. an Independent advisory panel;

c. the  Civil  Service  Appeal Board.

None of these options would necessarily preclude subsequent

recourse to an industrial tribunal, judicial review, or other

legal process, but should reduce the frequency with which that

was  likely  to occur.

Recruitment  of Staff

19. The method of agreeing terms and conditions for the

agency&apos;s staff will be set out in the framework. Agency staff

will be appointed from those already doing the work, transferred

from elsewhere in the Civil  Service,  or recruited    by a special

9

MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE


MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE

exercise carried out by the Commission (or by the agency in

accordance with a scheme agreed by them), or by a mixture of the

three. There will be a presumption that pay, grading and

superannuation will normally follow Civil Service models, unless

alternative arrangements have been centrally negotiated, or

negotiated by the agency with the approval and within guidelines

laid down by the Treasury. Positive performance incentives will

be considered in devising such arrangements. In considering

requests for special treatment, the Treasury will need to be

satisfied that it is necessary for the achievement of the

agency&apos;s aims, that the cost can be contained within the agency&apos;s

agreed resources, and that it can be ring-fenced. Other

Departments and agencies will be consulted if there is a risk of

repercussions elsewhere.

Modification of Framework

20. Shortly before or shortly after the appointment of the

Chief Executive, the framework will have to be reviewed by the

parent Department in consultation with the Treasury and the OMCS

as appropriate to take account of his or her view of what can be

delivered. One of the Chief Executive&apos;s first tasks will be to

supplement the framework with a medium term corporate plan to be

agreed by the departmental Minister after consultation with the

Treasury.

Establishment  of Agency.

21. With    the    completion   of    these    steps    the    agency regime

would have come into existence.

10

MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE


MANAGEMENT IN CONFIDENCE

RUNNING

Annual Planning

22. Each year, the Chief Executive will prepare a draft policy

and resources plan in informal consultations with the Department

and the Treasury. This will roll forward the corporate plan by

afurther year, and deal in greater detail with targets for the

first year of the revised plan. The first three years of the

plan will form the basis of the agency&apos;s input to the

Department&apos;s  PES submission.

Approval

23. The plan will be subject to approval by the departmental

Minister,  after consultation with  the Treasury.

PES

24. The resources sought in the annual plan will be considered

during the Department&apos;s PES discussions. They could be

negotiated either as part of the Department&apos;s programme (or

formal block budget where such an arrangement applies), or as a

separate ring-fenced item. Whichever course is to apply must

beagreed with the Treasury in advance. The agencies will be

expected to deliver at least the general level of efficiency

savings required in the PES settlement, and, given the nature of

their operations, it will In most cases be reasonable to set

higher efficiency targets.

Running costs

Where activities are classified as running costs now, they will

continue to be so classified. Their treatment will be based on

the same principles as for resources overall: similarly, the

relationship of the agency&apos;s running costs to those of the parent

Department must be agreed with  the Treasury  in advance.

11

MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE


MANAGEMENT  IN CONFIDENCE

26. Claims for exemption from gross running cost control will be

considered by the Chief Secretary against the criteria, agreed by

Ministers  from  time  to time.

In-year Adjustments

27. It will be up to Departments to ensure that the framework is

sufficiently stable to make the need for in-year adjustments very

unlikely. Any increases will have to be met from within

departmental programmes, and Departments should not expect to

seek claims on the Reserve in respect of  their agencies.

Repor ting

28. At the end of each year, the Chief Executive will submit a

report to the departmental Minister detailing performance against

plan and the use made of the resources provided. The report will

be accompanied by the draft rolling forward of the corporate

plan. The report may be submitted to the Prime Minister after

discussion with the Treasury and the Minister and will normally

be published.

29. Careful monitoring of the agencies&apos; performance will be

essential, particularly while the concept is new, and will call

for close consultation between parent Departments and the

Treasury.

ANNEX C

SP2AIQ 1

DRAFT ORAL STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER

Mr. Speaker, with permission I should like to

make a statement on the management in the

Civil Service.

I asked the Efficiency Unit to report to me on

the progress of management reforms in the

Civil Service.

They have produced a report - &apos;Improving


2

Management in Government: The Next

Steps&apos;.

The report finds that many Civil Service

managers want to see further changes

giving more room and flexibility for the

exercise of personal responsibility.

The report recommends:

first, to the greatest extent practicable.


3

the executive functions of Government - as

distinct from policy advice - should be

carried out by units clearly designated

within Departments, referred to in the

report as &apos;agencies&apos;.

Responsibility for the day to day

operations of each agency should be

delegated to a Chief Executive who would

be responsible for management within

policy objectives and a resources


4

framework set by the responsible Minister,

in consultation with the Treasury;

second, the Government should commit

itself to a progressive programme for

attaining this objective;

third, staff should be properly trained

and prepared for management of the

delivery of services whether within or


5

outside central Government;

fourth, a &apos;Project Manager&apos; at a senior

level should ensure that the programme of

change takes place.

The Government has accepted these four

recommendations, which will set the

direction for further development in the

programme of management reform.


6

Each agency will be accountable to a

Minister, who will in turn be accountable

to Parliament for the agency&apos;s

performance.

These agencies will generally be within

the Civil Service, and their staff will

continue to be civil servants.

The Government will develop a continuing

programme for establishing agencies,

applying progressively the lessons of the


7

experience gained.

The Civil Service unions will be consulted

about the setting up of particular

agencies.

They will also be consulted if any change

in terms and conditions of civil servants

is contemplated.

The centre of the Civil Service must be


8

organised in a way which is helpful to

bringing about change.

A Permanent Secretary in the Office of the

Minister for the Civil Service will be

responsible through the Head of the Home

Civil Sservice to me for managing the

process of change needed to implement the

recommendations.

I have placed copies of the Efficiency Unit&apos;s


9

report, together with a list of executive

functions which appear promising

candidates as initial agencies, in the

Library and Vote Office.


AGENCIES UNDER CONSIDERATION Annex D

The Government will be examining all its executive functions. But

Departments have already been able to identify a number of areas which

may be promising candidates for establishment as agencies. Examples of

these are:

Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office (Chancellor&apos;s Department)

Employment Services (DE)

Passport Department (Home Office)

Driver and Vehicle Licensing Directorate (DTp)

Vehicle Inspectorate (DTp)

Meteorological Office (MOD)

Non-nuclear Research Establishments (MOD)

Resettlement Units (DHSS)

Companies Registration Office (DTI)

Royal Parks (DOE)

Historic Royal palaces (DOE)

Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre (DOE/PSA)

Not all of these will necessarily become agencies, nor has the form

and timescale of any changes been decided.   Ministers will make

decisions on each area in the light of further work which is now being

put in hand to draw up appropriate policy and resources frameworks.
