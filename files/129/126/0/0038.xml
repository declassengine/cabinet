PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY:, PART TV OF THE PRICES and incomes act the PRIME MINISTER said that he had called the meeting toconsider the consequences of the decision by the Newspaper Proprietors1Association (NPA) to pay a 2s. a week cost of living bonus to 25, 000printing workers, which was due for payment from 1st September, 1966,under an agreement negotiated in April, 1964 but had hitherto beenwithheld in compliance with the prices and incomes standstill.    Astatement issued by the NPA late on 30th September stated that theAssociation had no alternative but to agree to the increase &quot;in view of itsacknowledge legal commitments and without the protection of statutorymeasures&quot;, and continued;-&quot;The Government has made no attempt to invoke Part TVof the Prices and Incomes Act of 1966 and thereforecontinues to impose upon employers a burden the Governmentis unwilling itself to shoulder.    In view of the county courtdecision in the Allen case AAllen v. Thorn Electrical IndustriesLtd^/ the NPA feels it can no longer refuse to honour itsagreement of April, 1964. &quot;MR. BARNES said that he had met representatives of the NPA&apos;sLabour Committee at the Ministry of Labour earlier in the day.     Theyhad informed him that at a meeting in the morning of 30th Septemberofficials of the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT) claimed that their members would not continue to tolerate non-payment of the bonusdue from 1st September and said that they were advised that failure topay the bonus rendered the whole of the April, 1964 agreement void.If the employers persisted in withholding the bonus, SOGAT would seek to negotiate new agreements chapel by chapel.     They would not agreethat the bonuses should for six months be paid to a recognised charity.After a meeting with officials of the Printing and Kindred TradesFederation later in the day the NPA had conceded payment of the bonuses,which would start to be paid on 3rd October.    It was clear that the NPAwas motivated partly by reluctance to continue in breach of a contractualobligation and partly by fears of industrial action.Morganite, a subsidiary of the Morgan Crucible Company,would likewise be paying increases of between 10s. and 15s. a week to2,000 workers from 3rd October.    There might well be other cases of failure to comply with the prices and incomes standstill.Thorn Electrical Industries Ltd. had been given 21 days in which to lodge an appeal against the judgment in Allen v. Thorn ElectricalIndustries Ltd.    The company would not wish to appeal on their own account, though they recognised the wider interests at stake.    Theywould, however, be prepared to delay their decision for a time, whilethe Government considered what course to follow.In discussion the meeting were reminded that the Cabinet had agreed on 29th Septemoer (CC(66) 48th Meeting) that, if the decision in the case of Allen v. Thorn went against the company, the first secretary of State should enter into consultations with the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) and the Confederation of British Industries (CBI) onthe question of bringing Part IV of the Prices and Incomes Act intooperation, and should refer back to the Cabinet if following those
SECRET314consultations he considered that this should be done.    Though the case was still technically sub judice unless and until the company formallydecided not to appeal, there was general agreement that the NPA&apos;decision had created circumstances which called for the initiation of consultations with the TUC and the CBI, and that the terms of the NPA&apos;sstatement made it difficult for the Government to do otherwise thanbring Part IV of the Act into operation without delay.    This action would indemnify employers who were prepared to comply with the standstill against suits for breach of contract if they withheld pay increases; it would not, however, prevent employers from payingincreases if they were minded to do so; nor would it enable employers who were paying increases before Part IV was brought into operation towithdraw them thereafter.     Employers could be prevented from payingincreases, or required to withdraw increases already in payment, only by orders made under section 29 of the Act, and such orders could nothave retrospective effect.In further discussion the following points were made -(a) THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said that some doubt had now been raised on the interpretation of section 29 of the Prices and Incomes Act.As this section was drafted, an order made under it would require an employer to revert to the &quot;rate of remuneration paid before 20th July&quot;.He had thought that this phrase meant money actually paid before20th July and that the section would thus require an employer not to pay more than was actually being paid immediately before 20th July.    Itwas now suggested, however, that this phrase might be construed as meaning the rate of remuneration payable in respect of the period immediately before 20th July, whether or not any payments had actuallypassed before that date.    If the order was so interpreted, an order under section 29 purporting to require an employer to withdraw anincrease due from a date before 20th July but not paid until after thatdate would be ultra vires.   So, while an order requiring the newspaper proprietors to withdraw the cost of living bonus (due from 1st Spetember)which they were now about to pay would unquestionably be valid, anorder requiring Thorn to withdraw the increase due to Mr. Allen andothers (which was from an effective date before 20th July) might, ifchallenged in the courts, be held to be invalid.(b) An Order in Council bringing Part IV of the Prices and incomes act into operation and not immediately followed by action to restrainprices or incomes under sections 27 or 29 could be justified asprotecting voluntary compliance with the standstill by the great majorityof employers and unions who were prepared to co-operate with theGovernment, in face of the selfish and destructive actions of the fewwho went out of their way to defy the Governments policy.    Once,however, the Government had made use of the direction   and ordermaking powers under sections 27 and 29 of the Act, employers and unions might become increasingly unwilling to hold prices and incomesvoluntarily, and it might become increasingly necessary to use statutory powers to maintain the standstill.    On the other hand, the NPAS action and their statement amounted to a direct challenger to the Government.If the Government did not make an order under section 29 as soon asthey had power to do so requiring the NPA to cease payment of the newbonus, other breaches of the standstill were bound to occur, and(amongst other things) the British Medical Association would resume their pressure for immediate implementation of the doctors&apos; increases.-3-
(c) If an Order in Council bringing Part IV of the Act into operation was made during the course of the following week, there would be acase for not taking any direct action on particular cases of increases of prices or incomes under section 27 or section 29 of the Act until after the House of Commons had passed a resolution affirming theOrder in Council.    On the other hand, since the NPA bonuses wouldalready have been paid with effect from 1st September, the longer themaking of an order reversing those increases was delayed the moredifficult it would become.    Some of the consequences of  such delaymight be avoided if it was made clear from the outset that the order,once made, would not be rescinded until it had been effective for a fullsix months.    Moreover, the First Secretary of State was required togive fourteen day&apos;s notice in writing of his intention to issue a directionunder section 27 or to make an order under that section or undersection 29:  so, even if the Order in Council bringing Part IV intooperation was made as early as 5th October and notice of intention toissue a direction or make an order was given immediately thereafter,the direction could not in any case be issued nor the order made until after the House of Commons had resumed.(d) It would be desirable that, if Part TV of the Act was broughtinto operation and notice was given before the House resumed of intention to make an order or orders on incomes under section 29,notice should also be given before the House resumed of intention toissue a direction or make an order on prices under section 27.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthere was general agreement that the First Secretary of State should now embark upon the consultations with the TUC and the CBI into whichthe Cabinet at their last meeting had authorised him to enter.    TheForeign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer were unable tobe present at this meeting, but he had ascertained that they sharedthis view.    In these consultations the First Secretary of State should say that in view of the NPA&apos;s action the Government were seriouslycontemplating the early activiation of Part TV of the Prices and incomes act,  without suggesting that a final decision had been taken, and should invite the representatives of the TUC and the CBI to express theirviews.    Time should be left for a second round of consultations, so thatany representations by the TUC and the CBI could be heard, considered and if necessary answered.The Cabinet should then be summoned on the evening ofTuesday, 4th October to consider what action the Government shouldtake.    Subject to anything that might emerge from consultations withthe TUC and the CBI, the recommendations from this meeting to theCabinet would be that The Queen should be advised that an Order inCouncil bringing Part IV of the Prices and Incomes Act into operation should be made forthwith, and that as soon as the Order in council was made notice should be given of intention to make an order (ororders) under section 29 requiring the newspaper proprietors to ceasepayment of the cost of living bonus due to their printing workers from 1st September.     If action was thus taken under section 29, it would bedesirable also to take action in a suitable price case under section 27before the House of Commons resumed, so as to demonstrate that theGovernment intended to apply Part IV of the Act no less to pricesthan to incomes.    Arrangements should be made so that a Privy council could be held, if necessary, as soon as possible after the Cabinet&apos;decision.
It would be necessary to consider, in the light of the doubtexpressed about the interpretation of section 29:(i)   whether notice should also be given of intention to make an order requiring Thorn to cease payment of theincrease due to Mr. Allen and others, which the recentcounty court judgment would oblige them to pay, and(ii)   if it was decided not to make an order upon Thorn,how such a decision could be defended when an order was being made upon the NPA, without disclosing thedoubt about the interpretation of section 29.    It wouldalso be necessary to consider whether notice should begiven of intention to make any other orders undersection 29, and what case or cases would provide asuitable occasion for action to be taken on prices undersection 27 before the House of Commons resumed.As soon as the invitations had been conveyed to the TUC and the cbi, a statement should be issued to the Press to the effect that, inview of the NPA8s action, the Government had decided to enter intoconsultations with the TUC and the CBI about the question of bringingPart IV of the Prices and Incomes Act into operation.Ministers -(1)   Agreed that the First Secretary of State should enterinto consultations with the TUC and the CBI onMonday, 3rd October about the question of bringingPart IV of the Prices and Incomes Act into operation,in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on29th September (CC(66) 48th Conclusions, Minute 3).(2)   Instructed the Secretary to make arrangements for theminutes of this me meeting to be circulated forconsideration by the Cabinet and for a meeting of theCabinet to be held at Brighton on the evening ofTuesday, 4th October, 1966.(3)   Agreed, subject to anything that might emerge fromthe First Secretary of State8s consultations with the tuc and the CBI, to recommend to the Cabinet -(i)   that The Queen should be advised that an Order inCouncil bringing Part IV of the Prices and incomes act into operation should be made forthwith;(ii)   that the First Secretary of State should, as soonas the Order in Council was made, give notice ofhis intention to make an order (or orders) undersection 29 of the Act requiring the newspaper proprietors to cease payment of the cost of livingbonus due to their printing workers from 1st September, 1966.-5-
(ill)   that the First Secretary of State should beinvited to take action on a suitable pricecase under section 27 of the Act before theHouse of Commons resumed.(4)   Invited the Lord President of the Council to make arrangements for the holding of a Privy Council,if necessary, as soon as possible after the Cabinet&apos;decision on these recommendations.(5)   Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultationwith the Attorney General and with other ministers as appropriate, to consider, in the light of thepoints made in discussion and in the Prime Minister&apos;summing up, and assuming that the Cabinet acceptedthese recommendations -(i)   whether notice should be given of intention tomake an order reversing the Thorn increases,and how to defend, if necessary, a decision notto do so;(ii)   whether notice should be given of the intentionto make any other orders under section 29 of theAct;(iii)    what case or cases would provide a suitable occasion for action to be taken on prices undersection 27 of the Act before the House of Commonsresumed.(6)   Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange fora statement, a copy of which is annexed to these minutes, to be issued to the Press as soon asinvitations to consultations had been conveyed to the tuc and the CBI.Cabinet Office, S.
