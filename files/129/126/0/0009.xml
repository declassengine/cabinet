W. 1.18th July, 1966
PUBLIC SECTOR IITVBSTMSNTNote by the TreasuryWe were instructed to prepare cuts in public sector investment,including expenditure by Central and Local Government, and byNationalised Industries, totalling at least  100 m.  in 1967/68.2.     We now suggest for the consideration of Ministers the cutslisted in this paper.    If all were effected, the result would be areduction in capital expenditure in 1967/68 of about  180-210 m.,with smaller but still significant reductions in the current year.This total is made up of  70 m. for public service investment and 110-140 m. for nationalised industries.    It is therefore possiblefor Ministers to exercise some degree of choice between the various possibilities listed, and still achieve cuts amounting to a figurewell in excess of  100 m.3.     These proposals have been discussed with representatives of most of the Departments concerned.    There has obviously not beenenough time to follow the implications of each through in anydetail;   but we are satisfied that they are realistic and fullycapable of achievement.4.     We have sought to concentrate on those items which, however 1desirable on broad general grounds, are not essential to the furtherance of the social and economic programmes to which theGovernment attach the highest priority.    In particular, we have not considered any cuts affecting housing, schools or the health service, although the total exclusion of these programmes hasinevitably limited our freedom of choice;    these priority programmesalso have implications for nationalised industry investment.5.     The reductions we have considered are as follows:-I.    Investment by Central and Local Government(a) Water and Sewerage.     Very stiff cuts on rural schemes inEngland and Wales, without touching schemes necessary on grounds of public health or housing development mightsave  11 m.(b) Swimming Baths.     A virtual embargo on the constructionof new swimming baths by local authorities (with some small savings on parks and recreational facilities)  12 m.(c) Local Government Offices.     A virtual embargo on building of new Local Government Offices -  10 m.(d) Town Centre Re-development.      A severe cut on new schemesfor re-development of town centres (including purchaseof land) - 2m.(e) Roads.     The Chancellor has already reserved the right tocall for savings of  12 m.  in 1967/68 as a continuation of the deferment exercise.    The Ministry of Transportconsider that the absolute limit for reductions is  17 m.(of which  15 m. fall on the Exchequer) if the road programme is not to be completely disrupted.    This wouldinvolve postponing about  100 ra. worth of work this yearand next - perhaps one-quarter of the new starts over that period.    These figures relate to England only;    the1
Ministry of Transport have indicated that if cuts ofthis order were enforced they would look for commensuratesavings in Scotland and Wales.    This would probablybring the total to  20 m., but we have not been able todiscuss this with Scottish and Welsh Departments.Covent Garden Market.     The postponement of the move ofCovent Garden Market to Nine Elms would save  5 m.The viability of this scheme has not been fullyestablished, and might be considered during the periodof deferment.Farm Structure.     The P.E.S.C figures include  7. for new proposals.    It now seems as though not more than 2 m. could be spent in 1967/68.    Even this amount couldbe saved by deferring the making of schemes under the agriculture Bill.Ministry of Public Building and Works.     A cut of 5Of0in new starts planned for building on behalf ofGovernment Departments would save  2 - 24. m.  (includingsite purchases).Local Health and Welfare.     A cut of 10% in loansanctions would save  3 m.Police and Prisons.     Capital cuts of  2-f- m. appearpossible (some of this might be found on small relatedHome Office Services rather than on Police and Prisonsproper).Higher and Further Education.     A saving of  2 - 2-g m.should be achievable - again with some elasticity as to where it might fall on these services.To summarise, the possibilities examined are:- m.Water and Sewerage 11Swimming Baths 12New Local Government Offices 10Town Centre Re-development 2Roads (England)           &quot; 12-17Roads (Scotland and Wales) 3Deferment of Covent Garden Market 5Postpone Farm Structure payments 2M.P.B.W.

Nationalised Industries Investment7o      The bids for nationalised industries investment in1967/68 had not been finalised but looked like running ata figure of  1,689 million,,8.     The extent to which this investment can be cut dependsto a large extent on the effect of the other measures taken by the Government to restrain consumer expenditure.In the context of the sort of package which we are considering, the following reductions appear practicable.In every case, however, they involve the deferment of projects which would in themselves be worth doing and also some risk of failure to supply essential services.     on balance, however, we believe that this is a risk which itwould be justifiable to take.Electricity9o      This accounts for  760 million of the total.      the deferment of one conventional power station, together withother reductions in reinforcement, distribution, showrooms,etc., would save  25 million.      The alternative would be to defer a start on Hinkley B nuclear power stations    this would save  35 million in all, and even so the safety margin would still be higher than it is now.      To these figures must beadded about  4 million for corresponding reduction inScotland.10.    This investment is particularly susceptible to decisions on housing, hire purchase and the regulator (in that order).It is also particularly difficult to take risks with.     Aspart of a package, however, it might be reasonable to cut 10 million.11.  10 million could be saved mainly by cutting out smoke-less fuel plants and certain diversification projects.Railways12.     10 million could be saved by delaying electrificationfrom Weaver Junction to Glasgow and on the Great NorthernLine, by deferring some signalling improvements schemes andby rephasing expenditure on stations improvements.(I &quot;London Transport13.     5 million could be cut by making no provision forextensions to the London tubes in 1967/68 and by reducingthe Routemaster contract.Transport Holding Company14.  5 million could be saved by making no new acquisitionsin 1967/68.GasCoal3/British Transport Docks
British Transport Pocks Board15.     5 million could be saved, mainly by deferring a starton the new dock at Southampton.     In addition if non-nationalised ports were subject to roughly a pro rata cuta further  10 million would be saved.British Waterways Board16.    Nil.     This Board only invests  1 million a year.Post Office17.     15- 20 million provided telephone demand can bedamped down by requiring rentals to be paid in advance.Air Corporations18.   Up to about  5 million might be cut from the airportsand non-aircraft expenditure of the two Air Corporations.In addition, about  20 million could be saved by cuttingan order for a replacement fleet for B.E.A. which theMinister of Aviation is about to put to Ms colleagues,   il.19.    In addition a reduction of about  4 million should bepossible in respect of A.E.A. Civil R&amp;D which is not included in the total of the nationalised industries investment.20.   All the above figures include known or reliable fore-cast slippage.     There is, of course, bound to be someslippage elsewhere in the programmes which cannot now before seen.     But it would be unwise, given the reductions weare now making to put it at higher than  50 million.21.
