CONFIDENTIAL j        229llS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)C(66) 141 COPY NO.    jjj18th October, 1966CABINETBROADCASTING policy memorandum by the Postmaster general at the meeting of the Cabinet on 4th August (CC(66) 42nd Conclusions,Minute 6), I was invited to make a technical appraisal of the possibility andimplications of setting up stations to transmit, soon after the end of the year,programmes similar to those provided by the pirate stations.    My report which envisages the establishment, by statute, of a new broadcasting corporation, financed from advertising, to provide a national popular musicprogramme and also a service of local sound broadcasting was considered at a meeting of Ministers under the Prime Minister&apos;s chairmanship on12th October.2.     Established by Act of Parliament, the new corporation would - unlike the Independent Television Authority (ITA) - itself sell the advertising time,and itself produce the programmes.    Like the ITA, it would be obliged tomaintain suitable standards in programmes and advertisements? to seek topay its own way and repay an initial Exchequer loan; and to surrender any surplus revenue to the Exchequer.    The Act would give the Governmentbroadly the same powers in relation to the new corporation as those theyhave in relation to the BBC and ITA.3.     The music programme would be broadcast on one of the mediumwave -lengths allocated to the United Kingdom,    Since all the availablewave-lengths are used by the BBC some curtailment of one of the existing services of sound broadcasting is inevitable.    Of the possibilities outlined in my report, the meeting of Ministers favoured a scheme in which themusic programme would be put out on a wave-length of 247 metres.    Thisis the wave-length used for the BBCs Light Programme to supplement the coverage of the long-wave transmitter on 1500 metres.    Used for a musicprogramme it could cover about 60 per cent of the population by day and about 40 per cent by night.    About 10 per cent of the population would loesethe Light Programme at night, and for another 20 per cent the quality ofreception of the Light Programme would be impaired.    The listenersaffected would, however, be able to receive the new music programme which would be generally similar in character to the Light Programme.4.     For local sound broadcasting my report envisages that the new corporation would establish 60 stations initially.    They would operate on very high frequencies (VHF) and each station would have a range ofa few miles.    For each town and city served the corporation would appoint a Local Broadcasting Council which would play a fully formative part inthe development of programme policy and content.-1-dONFgDENYBAL
5.     Both the music programme and the local sound stations would carry advertising,    A new corporation wovdd need capital over the first few years of  5 million which would have to be provided by an Exchequerloan.    The prospects for repaying this loan would be uncertain.    On thebest estimates available, the music programme would, by the fourthyear, perhaps be breaking even or at most achieving a surplus on running costs of slightly over   1 million a year;  but even by the fourth year thelocal broadcasting stations might be losing   1 million a year.    Duringthe first three years neither service would earn as much revenue.6.     There are possible variants of this scheme.    The local sound broadcasting element might be on an experimental scale (no more than a dozen stations initially) to test public response before large resources are committed to a general and permanent service; and the experimentalservice might be provided either by the BBC or by local Somnvunity1stations each under the control of a separate broadcasting authority.7.     However, the meeting of Ministers considered that the effectivechoice lay between the scheme described in paragraphs 3-5 above and theproposal contained in the draft White Paper (annex to C(66) 125) which Ipresented to the Cabinet at its meeting on 4th August.    This proposal was that the BBC should provide the music programme on 247 metresand undertake a nine-station experiment in local sound broadcasting.8,     Apart from the general considerations which apply to any servicefinanced by advertising, the main advantages and disadvantages of thesetwo alternative schemes are these.-(i) A music programme provided by the BBC could start quickly.A new corporation (which would need time to acquire sites and to build and equip the transmitting stations) would probably not be( ready before the early part of 1969.    Legislation wouldbe needed to establish a new corporation.(ii) A music programme provided by the BBC would not differ much from the present Light Programme,   The new corporation would give the listener an alternative to the BBC.(iii) The BBC could provide the music programme much more cheaply, both in capital and running costs.    On the otherhand the cost of local sound broadcasting provided by the bbc would have to be met from the licence fee reveneue,(The BBC estimate that a general service of local soundwould add 5 shillings to the licence fee).    The new corporation would earn substantial income from advertising,although it is uncertain whether it would be financiallyself-supporting.(iv) A limited experiment in local sound broadcasting would enablepublic response to be tested before large resources were committed.    On the other hand, a 60-station scheme wouldenable the sound broadcasting element of the Open Universityto start more quickly.-2-
9.     The meeting of Ministers was divided in opinion but the view ofthe majority was that the overall balance of advantage lay with thecreation of a new corporation to provide the services described inparagraphs 1-5 above.    It was recognised, however, that this coursehad the serious disadvantage that the music programme could not bebrought into operation for some considerable time after the enactment of the Marine, etc. , Broadcasting (Offences) Bill.    It was the unanimousview, therefore, that the BBC should be asked to bridge this hiatus by providing a music programme on 247 metres until the new corporationwas ready for service.10.     I have revised the draft White Paper annexed to C(66) 125 to reflect these conclusions.    The revised draft is annexed.11.     I accordingly invite my colleagues(i)      to agree that a new broadcasting corporation, financed by advertising, should be established to provide anational popular music programme and a service of localsound broadcasting on the basis outlined in this paper j    &apos;(ii)      to agree that I should discuss with the Chairman of the bbc the provision of BBC music programme on247 metres as an interim arrangement, and reportagain to the Cabinet if there is any obstacle to thisproposal;(iii)      to approve, subject to the consultation at (ii), the annexed draft White Paper.E.

Draft White PaperAnnex     ,       ^ o oyBROADCASTINGIntroduction1.     The Government have had under review various major aspectsof broadcasting policy.    First among them was the question of theBBCs finances.    Besides this, there were various proposals forthe further extension of the broadcasting services; that thereshould be a fourth television service; that a service of localsound broadcasting should be introduced; and that there should bean extra service of sound broadcasting entirely given over tomusic.2.     The Government have thought it best to consider them as a comprehensive whole.    For two other major questions it was however desirable for the Government to publish their views beforethe general review was completed.    A Bill to put an end to theactivities of pirate radio stations has already been introduced.And on colour television, the Postmaster General announced on 3rd March last the decision that a service using the PALtransmission system and broadcast on the 625-line standard would start towards the end of next year.3.     In reaching the conclusions announced in this review, it hasof course been the Government&apos;s duty to consider both whatpurposes the proposals for further extending the broadcasting services should seek to serve, and what organisation would bestpromote those purposes.    The Government have also had to consider to what extent it would be in the national economic interest toallow these extensions.    It is not enough that they should bedesirable in themselves.    The overriding consideration is whetherthe country can afford them.THE FINANCES OF THE BBCThe BBCs request for an increase in the licence fee4. Following the report of the Pilkington Committee in 1962, the bbc were authorised;(a(b(c(a(e(fto provide an additional television service - bbc;to provide self-contained television services forScotland and Wales;greatly to increase the number of hours for which itsThird Programme/Network Three broadcasts.    It nowbroadcasts throughout the day;to extend the Light Programme. It now broadcasts from5.30 a.m. until 2 a.m.;to provide more programmes of adult education on television.    Both BBC and ITA have made full use ofthis authority; andto start colour television on bbc.- 1 -
The decision to authorise these major developments waswelcomed; and, except for colour television - which is to startnext year - they either have been or are being carried into effect.5.     The understanding on which the BBC proceeded to carry out this programme was that they would be afforded sufficient income to finance adequate services.    In their Annual Report for 1962-63,the Corporation record that if they had received the full proceeds of a  5 licence from 1st April 1963, for which they bad asked,they could have financed their services out of income until theend of the nineteen sixties.    The Corporation&apos;s request was notgranted, but from October 1963, when the Government of the dayrelinquished the  1 annual excise duty, an amount equal to thewhole of the net proceeds of a i,k licence became payable to theCorporation.6.     In October 1964, the BBC represented to the Government thatthe combined television and sound licence fee should be raised from  k to  6, and the sound-only fee from  1 to  1 5s.   It was,of course, the Governmenfs duty first to satisfy themselves that increases of this order would be justified.   But it was also plain that some immediate action was called for to put the BBC in funds.The Government therefore decided that there should be a closeenquiry into the Corporation&apos;s finances, but, as an interim measure, also authorised increases in the combined licence feefrom  4 to  5, and in the sound-only fee from  1 to  1 5s.    Bothincreases took effect on 1st August 1965.The Governments enquiry7.     The Government have completed their enquiry into the BBCsfinances.   Practically speaking, the only possible ways ofproviding finance for the BBC are; by direct Government subvention,by the sale of advertising time in the Corporations services, orby the licence-fee system.8.     A Government subvention would be liable to expose theCorporation to financial control in such detail as wotild proveincompatible with the BBCs independence.    The money would, ofcourse, have to be found from general taxation.9.     Under their Licence and Agreement (Cmnd.2236) the BBC arenot allowed to broadcast commercial advertisements without firsthaving sought and obtained the Postmaster General&apos;s permission.Because of the probable long-term effect on the character of their services the BBC have never sought this permission.    The Governmentrecall that the Pilkington Committee found against the financing of the BBC in any measure from advertising, and that this viewcommanded general acceptance.10.    The Government have decided that there should be no changeat present in the arrangement whereby the BBC are financed throughthe licence fee system.    But at a time when none may be content torest upon present standards of efficiency and financial performance,good though they may be, the Government have thought it right to expect of the BBC that they should set themselves even moreexacting financial objectives.    They have accordingly asked them whether, assuming the expenditure ceiling which would be impliedif there were no increase in the licence fee for the present, theCorporation would be able to maintain their present services, andto proceed with extensions and developments either already authorised or proposed below.    The BBC have reported that, by making special economies, they will - on certain assumptions - beable to do so until January 1968 at least when they woiild need anincrease of  1,- 2 -
11.    In order to make these special economies, the BBC willrestrict activities which they have hitherto considered welljustified but which, against the background of continuedfinancial stringency, can be sacrificed to the overridingnational need for economy.    The Corporation have conducted asearching examination of all their ancillary services and operations, with a view to making the maximum retrenchment indetail.   By itself, however, this will not suffice.    Some larger scale projects, desirable in&apos; themselves, for enlarging andmodernising the Corporation^ programme production capacity, willbe forgone for the present.   But the BBC will be able to maintain their present level of programme output and to proceed withextensions and developments of their services already authorisedor about to be authorised.Licence evasion12.    One assumption on which the BBC have based their undertaking to manage without an immediate increase in the licence fee is thatcounter measures against licence evasion will prove effective.It has been reliably estimated that, of the gross revenueamounting to some  80m. payable in a full year, some  9m. is lost through evasion.    This is far too much to be tolerated.    Honestviewers and listeners are, in effect, paying for the dishonestyof the evaders.13.    Steps have already been taken by the Postmaster General to tighten up counter evasion measures, but, by themselves, they willnot suffice.    Further measures are required.   The Government arereviewing the penalties which Magistrates may impose on convictedevaders, and are discussing with the associations representingretailers and the rental companies ways in which dealers could help in the enforcement of the licence system.    The Government willannounce their proposals as soon as these discussions have beencompleted,BBC finance;    conclusion14.    The Government recognise the efforts which the Corporationare making to defer their request for an increase in the licence fee.    The increase will be required in due course, but, given the combined effect of the special economies to be secured by the BBCand of the further measures to be taken to combat licence-evasion,the Government are satisfied that no increase in the fee will be.required before 1968.A FOURTH TELEVISION SERVICE15.    Ultimately, the frequencies now available for television couldaccommodate six services of near-national coverage on the 625-linedefinition standard; two in the very high frequency (VHF) bands?and four in the ultra-high frequency (UHF) bands.    At present, theVHF bands are occupied by bbc and independent television, bothbroadcast on 405-lines.   Of the four 625-line networks possible inUHF, one is committed to bbc.    There is therefore unused frequencyspace in the UHF bands for three more 625-line services.    Space for two of them must be reserved in case it is required in order to change over the existing 405-line services to 625-lines by theduplication method.    This means that the present basis on which planning must proceed is that, for the next 10 to 15 years,frequencies will certainly be available for only one additionaltelevision service of near-national coverage, in UHF and on625-lines,- 3 -
16.    When the Television Act 1963 was before Parliament, theGovernment of the day stated their intention to allocate this service to a second programme of independent television during1965 unless the financial or other obstacles were insurmountable.However it were allocated, a fourth television service would makelarge demands on resources.   The three main services of televisionalready provide a large volume of programmes of various kinds andthe Government do not consider that another television service canbe afforded a high place in the order of national priorities.17.   Moreover, before deploying the last frequencies certainlyavailable for television for many years to come, the Governmentwould need to be satisfied that the case for committing them toany new service had been fully established,   ^Besides the claim of independent television, there is also the possibility that the frequencies would be required for a specialised service of educational television/.18.    The Government have decided that no allocation of frequenciesto a fourth television service will be authorised for the next three years at any rate.COLOUR TELEVISION19.    The Government have already announced the decision that colour television, using the PAL transmission system and the 625-linedefinition standard should be provided.    The service is to starttowards the end of next year on bbc.    In reaching this conclusion the Government saw as an important consideration the prospect ofincreasing exports - provided that an early start could be made.20.    In making this announcement, the Postmaster General statedthat if the Oslo conference of the International Radio consultative committee were to show that another transmission system foundgeneral acceptance, the Government would take such a developmentinto consideration.    In the event, the conference did not reach acommon view on any transmission system.    In general, the countries of western Europe expressed a preference for the PAL system, and france and eastern Europe for the SECAX III system.    Accordingly,in the United Kingdom the colour service will be provided on thePAL system.21.    It has always been recognised that the decision to providecolour television on the 625-line definition standard is dependent upon the intention to change over the two 405-lineservices of bbc and independent television - to 625-lines.    ThePostmaster General&apos;s Television Advisory Committee has been askedto report as soon as possible on the method of changeover to beadopted.22.    It is the Government&apos;s view that the cost of colour programmes,which are likely at the outset to be available only to a small minority of viewers because of the cost of receivers, should not fall upon viewers in general.    Accordingly a supplementary licence fee of  5 will be required from those equipped to receive colourprogrammes.One;
- 5 -SOUND RADIO23.    The BBC broadcast three programmes - the Home Service, theLight Programme and the Third Network. Complementary planningbroadly ensures that, at any given time, listeners have an effect-ive choice between programmes of different kinds; and, betweenthem, the three programmes cater for a wide span of tastes and interests ranging from those which attract very large audiencesto those which, being highly specialised, serve small audiences.The three programmes are widely regarded as very well suited totheir function of providing a comprehensive service of sound-radioon a national basis.A popular music programme2ko   The Government recognise that there is, however, a need for anew service, devoted solely to the provision of a continuouspopular music programme.   They do not consider that such aspecialised service, additional to the service of sound radioprovided by the BBC, should be financed by the licence fee system,the proceeds of which are required for the Corporation^ presentservices.   Accordingly, the Government propose that there should bea new programme of continuous popular music, but that it should be financed by the sale of advertising time825.    It will be provided by a new public corporation, which willitself produce the programmes and sell the advertising time; andwill be transmitted on a medium wavelength by a small number of high-powered stations.26.   Because the medium wavelengths available to this country arealready intensively used, it will be necessary to rearrange theirdeployment so as to release a wavelength for allocation to the new corporation.   The Government will discuss with the BBC how thisrearrangement should be made so as to cause the least disturbanceto their services.   Some disturbance will be inevitable.   But theGovernment are satisfied that the basic three programme patternneed not be materially affected.   /Some time must elapse before thenew popular music programme can start.   In the interim period, the bbc have undertaken to broadcast music in popular styles on theirmedium wavelength (2k7 metres) transmission of the Light programme at those periods during daytime when its transmission on the long-wavelength (1500 metres) is broadcasting the spoken word.   In thisway, there will from an early date be made available to listenersa daily programme of continuous popular music from 5.30 a.m. until6.30 p.m.; and from 10 p.m. until 2 a.mi7.- Local sound radio27.   No general service of local sound broadcasting, which would beavailable during hours of darkness as well as in daylight, can beprovided only on medium wavelengths allotted to the United Kingdom.The only possibility for such a service lies in &quot;VHF.    In practicalterms, some 150 towns and cities could be served.    Of the proposals put to the Government for the provision of a service, some advocatethat it should be provided by commercial compamies, others that itshould be provided by the BBC.28.   In a worthwhile service of broadcasting a local station should,the Pilkington Committee concluded, transmit &quot;for a sufficient partof the broadcasting day ^material/ of particular interest to thecommunity served by that station&quot;rather than to other localities.&quot;In their White Paper of July 1962 (cmnd.. 1770) the Conservative
administration agreed.&quot;that the justification for local sound broadcasting would be the provision of a service genuinely &quot;local1in character&quot;.   The Government share this view.29.   They consider that this objective would prove incompatible withthe commercial objectives of companies engaging in local sound broadcasting; and that, in the result, the former would be likely to suffer. In their view it is of first importance to maintain publicservice principles in the further development of the broadcasting services; and accordingly they reje&quot;ct the view that a service oflocal sound radio should be provided by commercial companies.30.   Evidence of the expertise and professional enthusiasm which the bbc would bring to local sound broadcasting is to be found in the trial &apos;programmes&apos; they have prepared.   These have been heard, asrecordings, by a number of audiences; and have been well received.-The scale of the BBCs total operation in broadcasting is, however,already very large, and it has already new and important commitments to meet in the extension of its television services.   The government consider that this operation and these commitments represent as large a burden as the licence fee system should be required for the preseni;to sustain.31.   Accordingly, they propose that the provision of a service ofloiBal sound broadcasting should be undertaken by the new corporation to be set up to provide the popular music programme; and that theservice of local sound broadcasting should also he financed from thesale of advertising time in the programmes.   Again, the new corporation will itself sell the advertising time and produce the programmes.32.   The Government envisage that some 60 stations would be built by the new Corporation.   For each town and city served theCorporation would be required to appoint a Local Broadcasting Council.Each Council would be widely representative of community - includingyouth - and would play a fully formative part in the development of programme policy and content.   The Government attach great importanceto the need to ensure that the services provided by the stations arelocal in character and not all moulded to a common pattern imposedfrom the centre; and it would be required of the new corporationthat the Councils would be afforded the maximum possible voice inthe direction and performance of the stations.33.   Legislation to incorporate the new Corporation, and to giveeffect to the Government&apos;s proposals for a popular music programme and local sound broadcasting, will be brought before Parliament assoon as possible.PAY TV34,   The Conservative Government authorised an experiment to last three years and granted a licence which will not expire beforeJanuary 1969.   The Government agree with this decision but they willnot allow a situation to develop in which the vast majority ofviewers are denied the viewing of major sporting events.HOURS OF BROADCASTING35,   The first White Paper (Cmnd,1770) on the report of the pilkington Committee stated that the Postmaster General&apos;s powers tocontrol the hours of broadcasting would continue,- In the TelevisionAct, 1963j and in the BBCs Licence and Agreement, approved byParliament in;January 1964, these powers were re-enacted in a more detailed forme- 6 -
- 7 -36.   It has &quot;been represented to the Government that, ideally,these powers should not &quot;be used, but held as a reserve power. Boththe ITA and the BBC would then be free to broadcast for as manyhours a day as they chose.   The Government have also considered&apos;whether, instead, there might be authorised a large increase in-the number of hours of broadcasting a week.37.   In a typical week BBC 1, independent television and BBC 2broadcast, for some 180 to 200 hours in total.   The amount of television broadcast here compares favourably with that of anyother Western European country and considerably exceeds that ,of most.38.   In the Government1 s view, the amount of broadcasting time willremain a matter of sufficient social importance to require that thePostmaster General should continue to hold and exercise his present powers of control.   Nor do the Government consider that any general increase in broadcasting hours will be justified for the present.They do not, however, rule out the possibility of more time for educational programmes.THE BROADCASTING AUTHORITIES;    THEIR COMMONRESPONSIBILITIES39.   Both the BBC and ITA are public corporations, whollyresponsible for the content of their programmes and for the day-to-day conduct of their affairs.   The principles that the public corporations should be independent of the Government has been upheldby successive Administrations since the beginning of broadcastingin the United Kingdom..    The Government adhere to this concept,40.   The Government has discussed with the broadcasting authorities,and with other parties in Parliament, the idea of establishing,subject to this governing principle, a council to consider general issues of broadcasting policy.   They have concluded that additionalmachinery of this sort would serve little useful purpose if theindependence of the two public corporations is to be maintained.Since full responsibility is required of them, they must be affordedfull authority to secure that their services are conducted in thegeneral interest.1+1.   Though Parliament has placed them in competition with eachother, they have a common objective of public service,    In the continuing task of realising this objective matters of common concern are bound to arise.   To discuss matters of this kind, theChairman of the BBC and the Chairman of the ITA have, the Governmentunderstand, established regular and frequent meetings.   The twobroadcasting authorities have now decided to put these meetings ona more formal footing and to use them as the occasion for discuss-ing matters which either Chairman might wish to raise.   The meetingswill continue to be private and unpublicised,k3. The Government welcome this means of consultation between thetwo authorities and their ready recognition that they will benefit from an understanding by each authority of the other view.
