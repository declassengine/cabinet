AC-RICUBTURAl, CREDITMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodWhen the question of credit for agriculture was considered bythe Ministerial Committee on Agricultural Policy at their meetingearlier this week, the balance of feeling in the Committee was that astatement should be made putting credit for agriculture on the same basis as credit for manufacturing industry, subject to the over-ridingpriority of credit for manufacturing exports.    The Committeerecognised that it v/ould be essential to make clear in the statement that this affected only the priorities within the existing creditrestrictions and did not imply any relaxation of the total volume of credit available;   and suggested that the statement might also make itclear that the provision of credit for purely seasonal purposes wasexcluded from the credit restrictions.     The Committee invited theMinister of Agriculture to seek the agreement of the Chancellor of theExchequer to action on these lines.    Unfortunately it has not proved possible to reach agreement.2.      The agricultural industry will not be able to achieve ourpresent targets for import saving unless we ensure that farmers can get the credit they require for expansion.    At present the banks do not regard productive investment in agriculture as ranking with productive investment in manufacturing industry.    This is their interpreation ofour present credit policy.    There is evidence that as a result of this the banks in practice are either not undertaking to make any financeavailable for productive investment in agriculture or are restricting such.finance to very narrow limits.    As regards seasonal loans, there is evidence that the banks are interpreting the credit restrictions in widelydiffering ways and in some cases with considerable stringency.Inability to obtain credit has resulted in heavy falls in the prices ofstore cattle and lambs and is leading some farmers to market theircorn at lov/er prices than is desirable - which will, if it continues,lead to increased cost to the Exchequer through larger deficiency round.3.      In our view there is urgent need to clarify the position both asregards seasonal and medium term credit.    As regards seasonalcredit, our request is that the Chancellor should confirm his view tothe bank3 that eidequate seasonal credit should be made available for agriculture, whether it takes the form of credit given directly to farmers or indirectly through such sources as agricultural merchantsor livestock dealers, and that this type of credit can be allowed to-1 -3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 130 COPY&quot;NO.     6 715th September, 1966CABINET
exceed the ceiling in the short term while seasonal transactions aretaking place.    Even, if some banks understand this, it is of greatimportance that this should be communicated to the Bank of Englandand be publicly known so that the present confusion which is leading toa lack of confidence can be brought to an end and so check the fall inprices,4.     As regards medium term credit, the most urgent need is thatcredit should be available for productive investment in agriculture andhorticulture required for the selective expansion programme.    Suchfinance, cannot be obtained from the Agricultural Mortgage Corporationwhich is concerned almost entirely with loans for land purchase andhas not got the financial resources to lend for other purposes.    credit of this kind has customarily been secured by loans from the banks.Unless medium term credit is made available for productive investment in agriculture and horticulture, there is no realistic possibility of oursecuring our present objectives of sa.ving imports through greater out-put of selected commodities at home.    Our import bill will go upsignificantly if we fail in these objectives.5.     We therefore request that the Bank of England should be told that it is the Governments wish that, in view of the importance ofagriculture&apos;s contribution to our economic strength, credit forproductive investment in agriculture should be regarded as on thesame basis as credit for productive investment in manufacturing industry.    This would have to be made publicly known if it is to help to restore the confidence needed in the industry for expansion.    Itwould of course be essential to make it clear that this affected onlythe priorities within the existing credit restrictions and did not imply any relaxation of the total volume of credit available.W.R.Scottish Office, S.
