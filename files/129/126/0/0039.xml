I SECRET -        320(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 139 COPY NO. jjj12th October, 1966CABINETRHODESIAMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth affairs attach an outline of the final statement of our terms for asettlement in Rhodesia which I would now propose to communicateimmediately to Mr,  Pmith.In addition., I would propose to let Mr. Smith have a separatecommunication in writing regarding the arrangements for a broadlybased interim government dealt with in paragraphs 13 - 16 of theattached statement.    This would be to the effect that it would be compatible with the arrangements which we have in mind that the interimadministration should contain a fair number of representatives of the rhodesian Front Party.    The British Government would be prepared toenter in advance into informal discussions through the Governor on the composition of this administration! and, if agreement were reached,would be prepared to see the new government brought into being by theGovernor summoning Mr. Smith and inviting him to form an administra-tion as so agreed.He B.Commonwealth Office, S, W.T.12th October, 1966
OUTLINE OF FINAL STATEMENT OF BRITISH GOVERNMENT1^TERMS FOR A&quot;SETTLEMENT IN RHODESIA(Note; This document is intended for communication, inwriting, to the regime.     The presentation of our terms to the Rhodesian public will call for separate consideration. )The British Government have now undertaken a final review of the rhodesian problem, in the light of the recent visit of the commonwealth secretary and Attorney General to Salisbury during which a atatement ofpositions on either side was drawn up*2.      The British Governments attitude remains based on the principles which successive British Governments have insisted must govern any constitutional settlement for an independent Rhodesia.    The major areasof disagreement turn on the application of these principles, and are notmatters to be resolved merely by detailed constitutional modifications.The Constitutional&apos; Settlement3.      The British Government have throughout shown their readiness to explore every possibility of reaching a settlement within these principles.    They have proposed, if it would facilitate the task of working out an independence settlement within the stated principles, that there might be an entirely new constitutional approach.     They further suggestedthat the assistance of constitutional experts from the Commonwealthmight be brought in to assist in working out such a new basis for a settle -ment    As a further possibility, they also proposed that a mission of commonwealth Prime Ministers might be invited to visit Rhodesia andto lend their good offices in devising a solution between Rhodesia and Britain.     They also declared themselves ready to enter into discussions about the possibility of an &quot;Act of Union&quot; between Britain and Rhodesia.Even the discussion of any of these possibilities has been rejected.    TheBritish Governments final consideration of the problem has therefore been confined to the possibility of a settlement based on the 1961Constitution with the changes necessary to give full effect to the principles.4.     It is the British Governments purpose that the political advance-ment of the Africans in Rhodesia   should be brought about in a way thatwill preserve good government and stability in the country, and safeguardits social and economic development within the concept of a societypledged to afford equal opportunity to all, regardless of race.    They accept that the pace of African advancement   should continue to be governed byachievement and merit L e, through the acquisition of the economic and educational qualifications prescribed under the 196X Constitution,    Theyare not prepared to agree that this advancement might after independencebe arbitrarily held back through the operation of powers left in the handsof the European minorityy if the latter judged at any time that the advent of African majority rule would be &quot;premature&quot;.    Such a provision wouldbe incompatible with the principle of unimpeded progress to majority rule.5.      The British Government must therefore continue to insist that theprovisions of Chapter III of the 1961 Constitution must be specially entrenched in any independence constitution.-1-
6.     As regards safeguards for the specially entrenched clauses of theconstitution, tho British Government would accept, as part of thenecessary machinery;, a Senate consisting of 12 Europeans and 12 Africans,which would vote together with the Lower House.    They consider however that the elected element among the Africans should be increased, to constitute an effective blocking quarter.    They would be prepared to seeup to three Chiefs included in the Senate.7.     The British Government have throughout insisted that anyindependence constitution must contain safeguards for specially entrenched clauses as effective as those provided in Section 108 of the1961 Constitution; and it is for this reason that their proposal for anexternal authority which would finally decide on such amendments hasbeen put forward.8.      The British Government would be prepared to see the externalauthority brought, into operation not by automatic reference to it of everyConstitutional Bill concerned with amendment of a specially entrenchedclause (as envisaged in their original proposals), but by a system ofappeal against sv.cb an amendment.    Such appeal might lie in the firstinstance to a &quot;Constitutional Commission&quot; in Rhodesia, consisting of theChief Justice and other Judges; with further appeal as of right to theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council.    The grounds of appeal shouldbe whether the amendment was in the interests of the people of rhodesia  a whole, or whether it discriminated or had the effect of discriminatingunjustly between the races or was incompatible with the Declaration of rights contained in the Constitution.9.      The British Government cannot accept the abolition of cross-voting or the fade-out of &apos;B1 roll seats, since these would be incompatible with the first and third principles.    They would agree to extension of theXB1 roll franchise to Africans over 30.The Fifth Principle10.     It remains the position of the British Government that any constitu-tional settlement for an independent Rhodesia must be demonstrated totheir satisfaction by a fair and free test to be acceptable to the people of rhodesia as a whole.    Until this test has been carried out, there can beno question of inviting the British Parliament to legislate for independence.11.     If informal agreement can be reached on the form of a constitutional settlement, which meets their requirements, the BritishGovernment will be ready to stand by that as the basis for negotiation witha legal government and for the eventual testing of Rhodesian opinion.    Butthey cannot accept that the testing of opinion should take place before there has been a return to constitutional government in Rhodesia, the censorship has been lifted and individuals detained on political groundsreleased provided they conduct their political activities peacefully anddemocratically.12.     They remain of the view that a Royal Commission should beappointed to test opinion in Rhodesia,    They would accept that the composition of the commission and the methods by which opinion shouldbe tested should be agreed with the legal interim administration when itis established.
Return to Legality32313.     The British Government adhere to the view that, before there canbe any formal negotiation of an independence settlement, a constitutional government must be established in Rhodesia.    A settlement negotiated onany other basis could not expect to secure the acceptance of the peopleof Rhodesia as a whole, or of the British Parliament, or of the generalworld community.14,     The British Government therefore require as the first step theappointment by the Governor of a broadly-based representative government ad interim.    This must be and be seen to be a fresh start -a government of a national unity representing the widest possible spectrumof public opinion of all races in the country.15.     The Rhodesian Parliament would inevitably be in abeyance duringthe interim period, since it would not be possible for the interim government to be responsible to the present Assembly,    RhodesianMinisters would be appointed by and responsible to the Governor whowould act on their advice in all internal matters of administration,subject to his control of the armed forces and police as described inthe following paragraph.16.     The armed forces and police will come under the direct responsi-bility of the Governor during this period.    While the Governor might inpractice act on the advice of members of the interim government inmatters concerning the armed forces and police and lav/ and order,the British Government would need to be satisfied that he retained powers in his discretion not only to deal with domestic disturbance and illegalitybut also to prevent a repetition of unconstitutional action and to protecthuman rights.    The British Government would reserve the right toprovide military assistance for these purposes if this is required by theGovernor in this period; and similarly to provide such assistance after independence by agreement if it is necessary as a further guarantee ofthe constitution.Racial Discrimination and Land. Apportionment17,     The British Government cannot accept that there is no case forany further action to give effect to the fourth principle.    They repeattheir minimum requirement that, as a contribution towards this, a royal Commission should be set up to study the problems of racial discrimination and in particular land apportionment in Rhodesia.Conclusion18,     This statement by the British Government spells out in practicalform the action necessary to give effect to the principles which theBritish Government has clearly and consistently stated.    It is now aquestion whether such a settlement can be worked out or whether mr. Smith will persist on his present course with incalculableconsequences for Rhodesia and indeed for the whole of Central and southern Africa.    The British Government for their part stand firmly bythe undertakings to which they are publicly committed by theCommonwealth Prime ministers communique in September.    Decisionsmust be reached at the latest by the end of November; and, if a settle-ment is not forthcoming by then, the consequential steps set out in the communique and other inevitable measures must follow.-3-
