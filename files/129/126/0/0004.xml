US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)REVISED INSTRUCTIONS TO IMMIGRATION OFFICERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department i am ci.rcula.ting for the information of my colleagues the attached draft, which is in the form endorsed by the Commonwealth ImmigrationCommittee.    I have undertaken to publish the revision by the summer recess and intend to do so on Tuesday, 2nd August.2.       The Instructions of May, 1962 (Cmnd. 1716) have been modifiedfrom time to time and the changes have usually been announced in    11Parliament.    The new version consolidates the amendments of substancewith the original and makes drafting changes in a few passages that havegiven rise to difficulties of interpretation.    It keeps the paragraphnumbering of the original.     Changes have been kept to a minimum;  thoseof substance are marked by numbered side-lining, a key to which is annexed to the draft.3.       The revised instructions contain little that is new, and I do notthink that publication will stir up fresh controversy over the policiesannounced in last August&apos;s White Paper &quot;Immigration from theCommonwealth&quot; (Cmnd, 2739).C(66) 10412th July, 1966CABINETR.H. J.K o rne Of f i c e, S. &quot;17.1.11th July, 1966
DRAFT INSTRUCTIONSco^tomealth naiicRAi^s act 1962TheHomg^Sgorgtary has issued the following instructionsto Immigration Officers on thgjgxe^ciaeof^ their functions under section 2 of the Act.   These instructions  our-ccrodethose^ published in Hay J.9,6&quot;,2.(Cnmd. 1716).general.     Immigration Officers   xri.ll    oarry        out their dutieswithout regard to the ra.ce. colour or religion of commonwealth citizens who may seek to enter the country.20     These instructions are intended for the general guidanceof Immigration Officers.   In particular cases of doubt ordifficulty, the senior officer in charge at the port will consult11higher authority in the Home Office.3.     In these instructions &quot;Commonwealth citizen&quot; means a commonwealth citizen who, by virtue of section 1 of the Act,is subject to immigration control.    &quot;Immigration officer&quot;includes a Customs Officer acting as an Immigration Officer.Entry Certificates4.     The Act itself provides for a system of employment vouchersissued by the Ministry of Labour;   the operation of this system is referred to in paragraphs 19 to 21 below.   In addition thereare administrative arrangements whereby any Commonwealth citizenwho wishes to ascertain in advance whether he is eligible for admission without a voucher may, if he chooses, apply to theappropriate British representative in the country in which he isliving for the issue of an entry certificate,   Such acertificate will indicate to the Immigration Officer that the holder appeared to the issuing authority to be qualified for admission, and the Immigration Officer should assume him to beso qualified unless he finds evidence to the contrary.   An1
entry certificate does not exempt the holder from the impositionof conditions (see, for example, paragraphs 7 and 16).Visitors5.     The need to impose a control on immigration for settlement in no way diminishes the Government&apos;s desire to welcome visitors.No obstacle is to be placed in the way of Commonwealth citizensgenuinely wishing to visit the United Kingdom whether on holidayor for social, family, cultural or business reasons.,6,,     If a Commonwealth citizen satisfies the immigration officer that he is coning as a visitor for a limited period,and can support himself and his dependants during that period,he and they should be admitted.    Other genuine visitors, forexample those coming to stay with relatives, should be readilyadmitted unless the Immigration Officer has reason to believethat their presence in the United Kingdom is likely to resultin a charge on public funds.   There is no objection to visitorscoming to this country for private medical treatment at theirown expense, but in doubtful cases the Immigration Officer shouldtake into account the Medical Inspector^ assessment of the likely cost of such treatment in deciding whether or not avisitor1s means would be adequate for his support during the visit,7-     The Immigration Officer should impose a condition limiting the length of a visitor&apos;s stay in the United Kingdom,*   an initial period of six months will normally be appropriate;   buta longer period may be allowed if the Immigration Officer is satisfied of the visitor&apos;s bona fides and his ability tomaintain himself and his dependants for that time.   Conversely,the Immigration Officer should consider restricting the periodof stay to less than six months if the visitor&apos;s intentions arenot clear or his means are limited.   In such a case it may also be appropriate to impose, in addition, a prohibition onthe talcing of employment where the Immigration Officer hasreason to suppose that the visitor, although not a voucherholder^may be contemplating taking up regular employment, _^_* The Homo Office will freely extend the period if good causeis shown.
8.     No obstacle will be placed in the way of a Commonwealthcitizen in transit to another country, so long as it is clearthat the person concerned has &quot;both the means and the intentionof proceeding at once to the country of ultimate destinationand is assured of entry there.Students9.     The Government welcome Commonwealth citizens coming tothis country for study.   The Act provides that admission isnot to &quot;be refused, except as mentioned in paragraphs 39 to 2j-2 below,to a Commonwealth oitizen who satisfies the Immigration Officerthat his purpose in coming to the United Kingdom is to attend acourse of study at a university, college, school or otherinstitution, and that the course will occupy the whole or asubstantial part of his time.   The term &quot;college, school orother institution&quot; includes &quot;both institutions supported by central or local government and private institutions.10.   A Commonwealth citizen seeking admission as a studentshould normally be expected to produce evidence of acceptancefor a course of study, beginning shortly, that meets therequirements of the Act (a correspondence co-p-rse does not meetthose requirements) and&apos; of ability to meet the cost of thecourse and of his own maintenance.   Little difficulty will thenarise unless there are grounds for doubting that his intentions aregenuine ond realistic, for example where there is ah obvious lackof correspondence between the student&apos;s previous attcinnents nndthe nature of the course he proposes to follow.   The immigration officer should be on his guard against attempts to useenrolment for a course of study as a moans of obtaining admissionwithout a voucher.   Attendance at the course must be thestudent&apos;s primary purpose in coming to the United Kingdom;   if his primary intention is to work and settle, he must qualify for admission on other grounds.3
j 11*   The entry certificate procedure is particularly appropriatej for a student who has not been able to obtain a place in advance *j! He will have to satisfy the issuing authority that he has had! genuine difficulty in making advance arrangements and that he hasj! a reasonable chance cf being accepted for the kind of course hei v! \vants to follow*     Due weight will be given to any evidence theiI student produces of qualifications he has already obtained, or ofj sponsorship by his home government or some other educationali authority.; 12,   As a general rule a student should be regarded as devotingj a &quot;substantial part&quot; of his time to his studies if he proposesi to spend not less than fifteen hours a week in organised daytimeI -j study of a single subject or related subjects.     The fact that aj student wishes to engage in paid employment in his free time oriij vacations in order to finance his studies is not a bar to hisI4   I admission as a student;   and the earnings that he can reasonablyij expect from such employment should be taken into account ini :j deciding whether he will be able to support himselfcI 13*   An Immigration Officer should be prepared to admit any&apos; CommonYijealth citizen if satisfied that his principal object inij coming to the United Kingdom is to study, even if the requirementsj of paragraphs 10 to 12 are not completely fulfilled.     But, in so  far as those requirements are not entirely satisfied, counter-vailing evidence of the student&apos;s bona fides should be required,14.   A Commonwealth citizen accepted for training as a nurse ata hospital in this country should be admitted as a student unless&apos;j there is evidence that he or she has obtained acceptance byJ misrepresentation or does not intend to follow the course.     Aj Commonwealth citizen coming as an apprentice or for training on thej job in some profession or employment should be admitted if he has either documentary evidence of sponsorship under an official schemei (e.g. the Colombo plan) or an entry certificate issued on theIi recommendation of the Ministry of Labour,
15.   A Commonwealth citizen seeking admission as a student should normally be expected to have plans for study for the whole of anacademic year.     One coming for a shorter course may, however,be admitted if able to support himself without working.I    16.   If a Commonwealth citizen has been accepted for a course ofl    study and there is no reason to doubt his bong fides, he should    normally be admitted for one year in the first instance and notprohibited from taking employment.    But if the immigration officer thinks it desirable that the Home Office should laterconfirm that an intending student has enrolled for a course ofstudies, or that he is attending the course for whioh he hadi    enrolled, he should restrict the initial period of stayS    accordingly and prohibit the student from taking employment in1i    the meantime.     In either case he should explain to the studentthat he will be allowed to prolong his stay if satisfactoryevidence of continuing studies is produced.Members of Parliament17s   Members of either House of the United Kingdom parliament will be admitted without hesitation irrespective of whether theyare subject to control under the Act.Persons coming for employment18.   Paragraphs 19 to 21 relate to employment in the serviceof an employer.    Paragraph 23 relates to the self-employed,19.   Subject to paragraphs 39 to 42, an Immigration Officer mustnot refuse admission to, or admit subject to conditions, a commonwealth citizen who is coming to the United Kingdom for employment and is the person described in a current Ministry ofLabour voucher.     No examination of such persons is necessaryunless to establish the genuineness of the voucher.     A voucherwill show the date by which it must be presented - normallysix months from the date of issue - but the immigration officer may admit at his discretion the holder of a voucherwhich is no longer valid if satisfied of the reason given
(e.g. illness of the holder) for failure to arrive at a UnitedKingdom port within the period of validity.   Ministry of Labourvouchers nay not be used r.more than once;    but persons who entered the United Kingdom as voucher holders, and go abroad for aholiday, will qualify for return in accordance with paragraph 35below.20.   &apos;7ith the exceptions shown in the following paragraph, thegeneral rule is that a Commonwealth citizen who wishes to enter the United Kingdom for the purpose of taking up or looking for employment must hold a Ministry of Labour voucher.   this requirement applies to professional people coning for employment and to employees of firms or organisations whose headquartersare outside the United Kingdom if they are t o be paid by a branchin the United Kingdom.   Persons wishing to take employment inthe United Kingdom cannot be allowed admission as relativesunless they qualify under paragraphs 24 to 33 below;   An exceptionshould not be made to this rule because it is claimed that a jobwill be found for the relative concerned.   Persons who requirevouchers but have not obtained then should normally be refused admission.21.   The following categories of&quot; people, although coning for employment, do not require vouchers:-(a) persons in the service of a Department of theUnited Kingdom Government^(b) persons not exempt from immigration control who are coming to the United Kingdom in -che employment ofany Commonwealth or Colonial Government, or in theemployment of the United Nations Organisation, orother international organisation of which Her Majesty&apos;sG-ovemnent is a member;&quot;Department of the United Kingdom Government&quot; does not include a nationalised industry or other public corporation
(c) persons coning for any employment that will lastless than two months, or for employment in sport orentertainment that will last for not more than sixmonths;(d) persons whose employment will be only incidental toa holiday;(e) ministers of religion, missionaries, and members of religious orders, including those engaged in teaching;(f) seamen under contract Co join a chip in Britishwaters;(g) operational staff (but not other staff) of overseas-owned aii-lines;(h) private servants of members of diplomatic missions;(i) seasonal workers engaged with the approval of theMinistry of Labour.Persons in these categories may be admitted if they have entry-certificates or other documentary evidence that no vouchur isrequired.Businessmen&apos;and self-employed persons22.   Businessmen admitted tc the United Kingdom as visitors willbe free to transact business during their visits.23.   A person proposing tc become a partner in an establishedbusiness in the United Kingdom should not be refused admissionunless it appears that the partnership amounts to disguisedemployment, :-r it seer.:s likely that, to get a livelihood, he willhave to supplement these business activities by other employment for which a voucher would ordinarily be necessary.   Self-employedpeople and persons seeking to set up in business on their own account should be admitted freely unless it seems unlikoly thatthey will make a sufficient living and my therefore need to seekemployment for which a voucher would ordinarily be necessary orto have recourse to public funds.7
Laves of Commonwealth citizens24.   Any Commonwealth citizen who satisfies the immigration officer that she is the wife of a Cooeonvealtfa citizen resident in the United Kingdom is entitled to admission, provided that sheis not herself the subject of a deportation order.   A Commonwealthcitizen who is the wife of an alien resident in the United kingdom has no similar entitlement, hut should be admitted.    &quot;Resident&quot;in this context includes a person in the United Kingdom for any temporary purpose.   A member of H.M. Forces based on the UnitedKingdom but temporarily serving overseas should also be regardedas &quot;resident&quot; in this context,25.   A woman who has been living in permanent association with aman, oven if not married to him, should be treated for thispurpose as a wife.   The Immigration Officer should bear in mindany local custom or tradition tending to establish the permanenceof the association.Children26.    Children under sixteen are entitled to admission if eitherparent is a Cca on wealth citizen resident in the United Kingdom.&quot;Resident&quot; has the same meaning as in paragraph 24.    &quot;Child&quot;includes stepchild and adopted child, and, in relation to the mother, illegitimate child.   A child under sixteen has no statutory right of admission as a dependant to join relativesother than parents, or to join his putative father, but theSecretary of State may authorise admission if satisfied that the child&apos;s exclusion would cause hardship.   The entry certificateprocedure will enable a decision on the child&apos;s admission to bereached before he sets out for this country.    If a child arriveswithout an entry certificate but the Immigration Officer hasreason to think special consideration is warranted, he shouldrefor to higher authority in the Home Office,    In exercising his discretion the Secretary of State will have regard to theage of the child, the arrangements to be made for his oare, andany compassionate features of the particular case,8
27.   Children aged 16 and under 18 should be freely admitted if they are coming to join both parents (or the only surviving parent) in theUnited Kingdom.   (The mother of an illegitimate child ray be treatedas his only surviving parent if she has had sole responsibility forhis upbringing.)   If, in any other case, the Immigration Officer findscompassionate circumstances that might justify the admission of a son ordaughter in this age group to join a parent, he should refer to higher authority.   Those who do not intend to join their parents do not qualify for admission as children, but may do so as students or under someother part of these instructions,28,   The general rule is that persons of eighteen or over must qualify for admission in their own right, for example as the holders of Ministryof Labour vouchers or as students.   But exceptions may be made to this rule.   For example, it will be proper to admit an unmarried and fullydependent son or unmarried daughter under 21 who formed part of the family unit overseas if the whole family is coming to settle in theUnited Kingdom;    or to admit a widowed daughter of any age who is dependent on a parent in this country if the parent undertakes to providefor the widow and her dependants.Husbands29.   The normal rule should be to treat a Commonwealth citizen aseligible for admission if the Immigration Officer is satisfied that heis coming to join his wife and the latter is ordinarily resident in theUnited Kingdom.   A husband so eligible who proposes to take or look forwork in the United Kingdom need not therefore be in possession of an employment voucher.   The Immigration Officer   should, however, considerrefusing admission ifthe husband (were he seeking entry on other grounds)would be liable to be refused admission on medical grounds, or on grounds of criminal record or security.   He should also consider refusingadmission if there appears to be no reasonable prospect of maintenance forthe man himself or his family without recourse to public funds, or if hehas reason to suppose that the wife does not want her husband to rejoinher.    In a doubtful oase, the Immigration Officer should take into account the strength of this wife&apos;s connections with the United Kingdom, includingher length of residence here.   Q
Parents30.   Widowed mothers, widowers aged sixty cr ever, and marriedcouples, one or both of whom is aged sixty or over, should beadmitted if their children are settled in the United Kingdom and are able and willing to support^ them and any relatives admissible as their dependants.Other relatives31.   A person qualified for admission may not bring with himrelatives of working age (which is to be regarded for this purpose as being below 60 in the case of a man and 55 in the case of a woman) unless they themselves are qualified for admission in theirown right.     In particular, relatives who want to work here mustthemselves obtain vouchers *    Near relatives (i,e., grandparents,brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles) who are no longer of workingage may be admitted if relatives here are able and willing tosupport^ them and if (a) they have long formed part of a familyunit whose other members are in the United Kingdom, or (b) they arein need of care and attention and have no relatives in their own countries to whom to turn,     Near relatives who are still of workingage may similarly be admitted if in addition they satisfy the immigration Officer that they do not propose to engage in anyemployment, and that they have a strong compassionate case for admission.      A widow who, if left overseas, would be wholly or mainly dependent for support on a near relative of herself or her husband in this country may be admitted, without regard to the other requirements of this paragraph, if the relative here has adequateaccommodation for her and any dependants of hers.      More distantrelatives (e7g., cousins) should not be admitted under thisparagraph save in exceptional circumstances.    For persons who arein receipt of pensions, or possess independent means and wish to retire to the United Kingdom, see paragraph 37*For the purpose of paragraphs 30 and 31, a person should beregarded as unable to support a relative if he cannot providehim with adequate accommodation.10
Fiance&quot;(e)s32.   Whan dealing with a Commonwealth citizen of either sex coming to the United Kingdom for marriage to a person already here, the immigration Officer should first consider if the person concerned would qualify for admission if the marriage had already taken place.He should also be reasonably satisfied that the proposed marriagewill take place within a reasonable time,.     A period of three monthsis normally regarded as appropriate.     If these conditions aresatisfied, a fiance(e) will qualify for admission.,     The initial period of stay should normally be limited to three months , with an explanation that he or she should apply to the Home Office for removal of the condition once the marriage has taken place.Relatives:    general33.   The principles in paragraphs 24 to 30 above apply to commonwealth citizens accompanying persons qualifying for admissionas well as to those joining relatives already tattled in the UnitedKingdom,     Thus, for example, if a Commonwealii citizen qualifiesfor admission because he holds a voucher or is exempt from theprovisions of the Act because he was born in the United Kingdom, his wife and children under sixteen will equally be entitled to admission,and his own or his wife&apos;s widowed mother may also be admitted if heis able and willing to support^ her.34*   When a Commonwealth citizen claims admission under paragraphs20 to 33 the Immigration Officer should take account of anydocumentary evidence he produces in support of his claim and of whether he has an entry certificate indicating that the claim has passed a preliminary scrutiny overseas.     The Immigration Officerwill, however, know that some would-be immigrants have been able to procure documentary evidence to support false claims to the status of dependants and that an officer issuing entry certificates overseashas only limited opportunities to verify applicants&apos; statements by independent inquiry.    The Immigration officer&apos;s decision should therefore be based on the whole of the information that becomes ;--, ---,-,-,-F or the purpose of paragraph 33 a person should be regarded asunable to support a relative if he cannot provide him with adequate accommodation.11
llu Jinn ^^^&quot;^^Jf^^L S ^b^&quot;&quot;^&quot;941available in the course of his examination,, and should take accountcf anything that may be said by a relative or friend of theCommonwealth citizen in this country.     If a relative or friendwishes to see a Commonwealth citizen who has been refused admission,and can arrive at the port within a reasonable time, theCommonwealth citizen should not be sent back until they have met.Commonwealth citizens already settled in the United Kingdom35*   With the sole exception of a person subject to a deportationorder, any Comnonv/ealth citizen is entitled to admission if hesatisfies the Immigration Officer that he is ordinarily resident inthe United Kingdom or has been so resident at any time during theprevious two years.51&apos;     The record of movements in the passport willoften show the period of absence from the United Kingdom/ and the identification of persons returning after a short absence, e.g. on holiday, will not ordinarily present difficulty.     All those whohave taken settled employment in the United Kingdom are to beregarded as ordinarily resident here after their first entry andthus entitled to benefit from the relevant provisions.     the immigration Officer should satisfy himself that a Commonwealthcitizen who claims to be returning to the United Kingdom afterprotracted absence has had his permanent hone here at some time in theprevious two years, bearing in mind that ordinary residence in theUnited Kingdom is compatible with lengtny absences abroad on business or in the employment of a firm based in the United Kingdom.36.   If a Commonwealth citizen is not entitled to return becausebe has not been ordinarily resident in the previous two years,and if he does not qualify to enter the United Kingdom under anyother part of these instructions, he can still be admitted if,for example, he has strong family ties here said has previouslylived in the United Kingdom for some time.    A Commonwealth citizen* Commonwealth citizens whose stay has been made subject to a timecondition are not, in law, ordinarily resident here during theperiod of the time condition*^ Since 1st July 1962 Immigration Officers have stamped the passportsof Commonwealth citizens passing through the controls when landing in, or embarking from, the United Kingdom,12
who-had lived most of his life in the United Kingdom and wanted to return here eculd properly be readmitted after quite a longabsence.Persons of independent means37.   A Commonwealth citizen is entitled to admission if he canshow that he can support himself, end his dependants, in theUnited Kingdom without taking a job.   A Commonwealth citizenwishing to settle in the United Kingdom should therefore beadmitted, with his dependants, if he satisfies the immigration officer (for example by producing a bank statement or a statementof pension entitlement) that he has adequate means of supportunder his own control and disposable in the United Kingdom.   Themeans should bo adequate, not merely for a year or two, but forthe foreseeable future.. &apos;.    &quot; --0-0.^0:&apos;Service in thj^lrmed Forces of the Crown38.   \.hen an Immigration Officer is dealing with a case falling within his discretion, he should resolve any doubt (unless thereare compelling reasons to the contrary) in favour of an applicantwho can satisfy him that he served in the Armed Forces of theCrown at any time in war or, since the end of the Second WorldY/ar, has served the Crown as a member of the home forces as defined in section 17(5) of the Act,Statutory grounds for refusal of admission ofusal on medical grounds39.   The power to refuse admission on medical grounds does not appl^to persons entitled to admission as wives, returning residents orchildren under sixteen.    With these exceptions the immigration officer should normally arrange with the Medical Inspector forthe examination of holders of Ministry of Labour vouchers andother Commonwealth citizens who are coming for settlement in theUnited Kingdom.     Visitors, students and others who intend toremain in the country for six months or more should normallyalso be referred to the Medical Inspector,     Any person, whatever
the proposed length of his stay, who mentions health on theprospect of medical treatment as among the reasons for his visit,and any person who does not appear to he in good health or appearsmentally or physically abnormal, should also be referred to theMedical Inspector.?   Any person who produooe a nodical eovtifiotfU^should be advised to hand it to the Medical Inspector.   TJhere a medical Inspector certifies -that it is undesirable for a person to be admitted for medical reasons or that he is suffering frommental disorder, the Immigration Officer should refuse admissionunless there appear   to be strong compassionate reasons for not doing so, in which case ho should seek instructions from higher authority,   &quot;/here, exceptionally, no medical Inspector is available, the Immigration Officer may act on the advice cfanother duly qualified medical practitioner.refusal on grounds of crin^al^re^ord40.   The discretion to refuse admission on grounds of criminalrecord, does not apply to persons entitled to admission as wives,returning residents or children under sixteen.   TJith theseexceptions, the Immigration Officer may refuse admission to anyCommonwealth citizen if he has reason to believe that theindividual has been convicted in any country (including .the UnitedKingdom) of an extradition crime.   The Immigration Officer will normally learn of such convictions only through prior notification.If a person whom he is examining appears prima facie to be aperson in respect of whom a notification has been received, heshould endeavour to confirm the identification.   If it seems tohim that there are compassionate grounds for not refusingadmission, for example strong family connections with the UnitedKingdom, ho should seek instructions.*   These arrangements are without prejudice to any arrangementsfor the time being in force under public health powers forthe medical examination of all passengers from certain countries.
Refusal on grounds of security41.   This power does not apply to x^erscns entitled to admissionas wives, returning residents or children under sixteen.   the immigration Officer will receive notification of any persons whoby decision of the Secretary of State are to be refused admissionin the interests of national security.   If he has strong grounds for believing that the Secretary of State would reach such adecision in respect of any other Commonwealth citizen, instructionsmust be immediately sought.Deportation orders42.   /jay Commonwealth citizen who is currently the subject of adeportation order should be refused admission.   (The revocationof a deportation order requires the approval of the Secretary ofState, and any representations should be referred to higher authority in the Home Office.)Refusal ojf j?dnission:    general43.   The power to refuse admission should not be exercised by anImmigration Officer acting in his sole discretion;   the authorityof a Chief Immigration Officer or Immigration Inspector must always be obtained.   &quot;There admission is refused, &quot;the immigration officer should, so far as practicable, moke clear to theindividual concerned the reasons for the refusal.1;5
ANNEXKey to marginal numbers in the revised instructionsto immigration officers. This substitutes new words because the old implied too strongly thatan entry certificate holder was virtually guaranteed admission.   Moreholders of entry certificates have had to be refused admission than was thought likely when the original instructions were given.2.     This is consequential on paragraph 22 of Cmnd. 2739 and Sir Frank Soskice&apos;sstatement of 4th February 1965.   The rewording seeks to remove the possibleimplication that no visitor need secure an entry certificate.j3,     This is consequential on paragraph 22 of Cmnd. 2739 and the statement of 4th February 1965.   It allows the immigration officer discretion to grantinitially a stay of longer than six months where the visitor&apos;s frona fidesare not in doubt.This is consequential on paragraph 22 of Cmnd. 2739 and the statement of 4th February 1965.The Commonwealth Immigration Committee approved these proposals inC.I,(65)50 on 22nd December 1965 (see C.I.(65) (6th Mtg. Conc.(l)).8.     This is consequential upon paragraphs 20 and 21 of Cmnd. 2739.9*     All after the semi-colon is new.   Refusal to admit a dependent widoweddaughter may lead to hardship. Under this concession, the immigration officer will still have to verify the ability of the parent to supportnot only the widow but also her own dependants.1 0.   The last seven words are new:    if a test is to be applied, it shouldbe applied to the whole potential obligation.II. This sentence is new and extends the concession of paragraph 28 to thewidowed close relative where she is being supported abroad by therelatives already here and where also they can offer adequate accommo-dation both to the widow and her own dependants.12.   This has been in force for some months but the change has not been announced in Parliament,   (it was previously exceptional for a personaccepted as a fiance(e) to be admitted subject to conditions.)13.   Consequential on Sir Frank Soskice&apos;s statement of 4th February 1965*14.   This expansion of the categories sent for medical inspection is inaccordance with the wishes of the Ministry of Health.
