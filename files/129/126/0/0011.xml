If Ministers wish to include in further measures of restraintsome tightening of hire purchase restrictions, the Board suggestthat the new rates should be as follows:-Deposit33i%2C?bRepayment period(months)2k2k2kCookers and WaterHeatersIn order not to upset the balance in favour of hiring agreements,it would be necessary at the same time to increase the minimumrental period under the Control of Hiring Order from 32 weeks to42 weeks.3.     The total effect on net borrowing on hire purchase of allthese changes would after one year be a reduction of  160 me, made up as follows:-Reduction in net borrowingCars  100 m.Domestic Appliances  30 m.Furniture  30 m. &apos;^&quot;i^ ^ alternative would be to increase the deposit on cars to33s/ instead of 40%..    This would reduce the effect on net borrow-ing to  120 m.     It would then be necessary to have two minimumrental periods, 35 weeks for cars and k3 weeks for domesticappliances.     This would complicate the preparation of the order and to some extent the administration.1Hire Purchase RestrictionsNote by Board of trade the present restrictions (which were imposed on Uth February1966) are as follows:-

Theminimum rental periods would be:-Cars 52 weeks ,Domestic Appliances        6U weeksThis would introduce the same complications as those already mentioned in paragraph h above.Timetable7.
