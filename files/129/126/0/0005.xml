C(66) 10512th July, 1966REORGANISATION OF THE POST office memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic affairs for some considerable time now the Government have been considering the case for reorganising the Post Office on the lines of a nationalised industry, run by a corporation (or series of corporations)appointed by a Minister.    Before the last election the ministerial committee on Economic Development came to the conclusion that a change to nationalised industry status was desirable in principle, in the interestsof promoting greater efficiency and technical development;  but we thoughtthat before making an announcement we should be clearer about the general lines of the structure of the new organisation, and in particular whether we preferred a single corporation responsible for all post office services or separate corporations for the various services.    We also thought thatwe ought to consider further the position of the staff, the safeguards theywere likely to demand and the probable cost of such safeguards.2.       These questions, and other related issues, have now been furtherstudied by the Sub-Committee on the Status and Organisation of the PostOffice, and the matter was further considered by the ministerial committee on Economic Development at their meeting on lith July(ED(66) 18th Meeting).    This memorandum reports the Committee1 conclusions.Status3.      We are satisfied that a case has been made out for changing thestatus of the Post Office to that of a public corporation.     The mainargument for doing so is that, as a public corporation, the Post office should be better able to develop its managerial and technologicalefficiency and its relationships with the industries with which it deals.4.       Inevitably it will be in some respects unlike the existingnationalised industries;  in particular, its relationship with theGovernment will be especially close because of the agency services with which the Post Office will continue to provide the Government,The management of the Post Office are likely to be liable to Ministerialdirections or subject to Ministerial approval in a number of respects inwhich other public corporations are not formally so restricted.    It willbe important to establish from the outset, and in the legislation thatwould be required, that the reorganised Post Office will continue to havea responsibility for providing comprehensive national telecommuncations and postal services;  we must not allow fears to develop that the changeof status is a prelude to reductions of services, particularly in outlyingareas, in the name of efficiency and viability.COPY NO.67CABINET-1-COMFBDENTIAL.IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC 1&apos;Majesty&apos;s&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
Structure5.       The structure we favour is that of a single corporation,responsible for telecommunications and postal services and for the day-to-day management of the savings and banking services as the agent ofthe Treasury.     Changes in internal management organisation will givea substantially greater degree of independence to the telecommunicationsservices and to the postal services in relation to each other than theyenjoy at the present time.    The Postmaster General does not want atthis stage to be committed to the precise form cf the internal managementorganisation, though it is envisaged that some changes could be madeeven before the Post Office became a nationalised industry.6.       It would be somewhat easier to transfer functions of the PostOffice to a single corporation than two or more separate corporations.The leadership of the Post Office Engineering Union have long favoured the concept of separate nationalised industry status for the telecommunications-tions services, but they would probably accept a single corporationprovided that the telecommunication services enjoyed substantialindependence of management.    The General Secretary of the Union of post Office Workers indicated in a recent speech to his union1 conference that there need be no objection in principle to nationalised industry status for the Post Office, provided that all the services werethe responsibility of a single corporation, though he indicated that therewould not be much to be said for the change unless it was accompaniedby a complete change of attitude in the management on questions of pay and conditions.Agency services.       The new corporation would manage the savings and bankingservices on the treasury s behalf;  the Treasury would remain responsible for policy.     The Government v/ould retain the power torequire the new corporation to provide other agency services to theGovernment at cost.    We envisage that the Ministry of Public building and Works would continue to provide building services to the Post office as at present.    These services constitute a significant part of theMinis try&apos;s work, and the Minister would be reluctant to see themsubstantially diminished.     Most of us consider that they can be safeguarded by an administrative agreement (such as already exists)to the effect that neither the new corporation nor the Government would do anything which would result in any substantial amount of the workconcerned ceasing to be done by the Ministry without adequate notice and full consultation.    To go further than this would be to impose whatmost of us consider would be an unnecessary statutory restriction onthe corporation.    The Minister of Public Building and Works, however,feels that the matter is so important that the position should be safe-guarded by means of a reserve statutory power to give directions tothe corporation on this matter.    This is a matter upon which no decision needs to be taken at this time;  the Minister of Public building and Works has reserved his position for future discussion.
Cost of the Transfer8.       The Sub-Committee on the Status and Organisation of the PostOffice have concluded that the transfer of staff to a new corporation wouldhave to be compulsory.    The staff would lose their Civil Service status,but they would no doubt seek interim assurances that they would retain atleast the pay and conditions of service which they now enjoy.    It issuggested that the change of status itself would not be something to be negotiated with the staff, and that there would thus be no price to bepaid for union acceptance of the change of status.    Clearly no assurance could be given on conditions of service which would either commit orfetter the discretion of the new corporation, whose responsibility it wouldbe to negotiate long-term settlements with the unions on pay andconditions.9.      A new corporation would be subject to the same sort of restraintsas other nationalised industries are in negotiating pay and conditions, andthere is no reason to suppose that they v/ould be predisposed to makeundue concessions.    But they might well find themselves obliged to payhigher rates of salary in senior posts, in the interest of efficient management, and this could affect salary rates down the line.    More-over, the words used by the General Secretary of the Union of PostOffice Workers suggest that the union would be looking for a moreforthcoming attito.de from the new corporation than from the PostOffice.     The pressure on the new corporation to pay higher wages and salaries could thus be fairly heavy, though the problem is not likely to arise for some time, since the corporation cannot be in being before1968..TiiTiing of Announcement10.      If the Cabinet agree that the Post Office should be reorganisedas a public corporation, the Postmaster General would like to announce this decision on 20th July, when he will be publishing his annual report and accounts and his proposals for tariff rationalisation.    The announce-ment would be made in the House of Commons and v/ould be on thegeneral lines of the draft attached.    If the Cabinet are content with thegeneral lines, I suggest that the Postmaster General should be free tomake whatever drafting changes he considers   desirable.Conclusion11,       The Cabinet are invited to authorise the Postmaster General tomake a statement in the House of Commons on 20th July on there organisation of the status of the Post Office, on the lines of theattached draft.G.B.Department of Economic Affairs, S. W.l.12th July, 1966-3-CONFSDENTSAL
POST OFFICE REORGANISATIONDraft Statement in the House of commons during the last 18 months a fundamental examination of themanagement, structure and status of the Post Office has taken place.2.       Telecommunications are growing very fast and face formidableproblems of expansion.     The postal services, too, will be required to adapt themselves to the changing circumstances of the future.    the savings and banking services are also expanding, and a giro is to be launched within two years,3.       The Post Office exists to provide comprehensive nationalservices in the field for which it is responsible.    Clearly any reorganisa-tion must retain this principle and must make sure that the organisation is such as to recognise and ensure that the responsibility for providingthese services to the public is fully maintained.    It is, however, open for question whether all the tasks now carried out by the Post Office can best be performed by a Department of State,    After the most carefulconsideration the Government have concluded that the time has come tomake a change, and that, instead of being a Department of State with a minister at its head, the Post Office should become a public corporation,the members of which would be appointed by and responsible to a Minister.Within this corporation the management of the various services wouldhave an opportunity to develop on more independent lines, but alwayswith a primary responsibility for the maintenance of comprehensivenational services available to all citizens in all parts of the country.4.      A final decision on the exact form of the reorganisation and of theinternal management structure must await publication of the report ofthe Select Committee on the Nationalised Industries, which is nowexamining the Post Office, and consultations with representatives of thestaff.     These consultations will now be put in hand, and a White paper will be presented in due course setting out the Government&apos;s finalproposals.5. The Government believe that this decision to modernise thestatus and management of the Post Office will make a considerablecontribution to its efficiency in the years ahead.
