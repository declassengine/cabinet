&apos;      2 29C(66) 13115th September, 1966AGRICULTURAL CREDITMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer cannot agree with the Minister of Agriculture&apos;s proposals for achange in policy on credit for agriculture, nor with his statement of thefacts on which these proposals are based.    My information is thatcredit-worthy farmers are being treated by the banks with sympathy and consideration - indeed as a general rule every bit as generously as indus-tril borrowers of comparable standing.    In particular:COPY N(fe.v cabinet(i)   The banks are meeting normal seasonal requirements.    This isin line with the official guidance which sets a limit on banklending after allowance for seasonal factors;   and I am convincedthat there is no misunderstanding among the banks about this.(ii)   The same is true in most cases where finance is required fromone to three years for stock rearing for the market.(iii)  The banks are prepared in many cases to consider reasonablyshort or medium-term loans for purchase of equipment.2.      All this is reflected in the fact that at the latest date for which figures are available - mid-August 1966 - loans for agriculture were,despite the general squeeze, somewhat higher than at the same date ayear ago.    Since farmers in common with others have had their loans for personal expenditure cut, this implies that advances to them forother, productive, purposes have actually gone up.    Admittedlyadvances to industry have increased more.    But the circumstances ofthe two cases are very different, and there is no reason to believe thatthe credit squeeze has bitten more deeply on the agricultural man onthe manufacturing sector.3.       At a time of general stringency the banks cannot be expected to lend for really long-term purposes, such as the purchase of land ormajor improvements to buildings, etc., or even for equipment whererepayment is spread over many years.    For these farmers must continue to look to the Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (which hasbeen lending at a record rate and is on the point of increasing itscapital) to hire purchase finance, or to their suppliers.    Undoubtedlysome will find it difficult to get what they want, but this is a commonexperience shax-ed by many would-be industrial borrowers too.    Thefact is that though productive investment in manufacturing indusrty was commended in the December 1964 guidance to the banks, it was not specifically mentioned in the May 1965 letter from the Governor, whichput exports right in the forefront.    In present circumstances bankcredit even for investment in manufacturing industry has to be restrictedand borrowers forced to look to other sources of finance.-1-CONFIDENTSALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
4.      All in all therefore I believe it would be dangerous to make achange in our credit policy now which would be difficult to apply, leadto confusion among the banks which might impair their effectiveness in applying the credit squeeze, raise expectations that are likely to be disappointed, and be widely misunderstood, particularly abroad.    Thelast would be especially unfortunate at a time when confidence in sterling shows the first signs of revival.5.       The claims on national resources by agriculture will have to be reviewed in the light of the expected lower growth in the economy.    ButI have no evidence that the restrictions on credit would prevent the fulfilment of the selective expansion programme.     The position will be improved further as the investment grants come into operation.6.       All the same, I see no reason why we should not make clearerthan appears now tc be the case what is actually happening in the field of credit for agriculture.    While strongly opposing any change in our policy I suggest that the Minister in his forthcoming speech might include an explanatory passage, which I should be happy to supply.7,       Wq shall be reviewing this autumn the credit facilities availablefor productive investment generally.     This review will provide the context for further consideration of agriculture.I.f. J&quot; o C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.15th September, 1966-2-
