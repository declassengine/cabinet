Overseas economic aid (net of capital repaymentsonly)                          &apos; 195Diplomatic Service Vote and Information Expenditure      25Subscriptions to International Organisations 30Payment Overseas of certain Pensions 20Total Government Overseas Expenditure(substantially Gross) 5804.     Ministers loft for further consideration, in the light of the studiesby officials, where the cuts might be met as between these blocks ofexpenditure.   As indicated below, the only items where major economiescan be achieved are:   Defence, Overseas Economic Aid, Military Aid.*   Only a proportion, variously estimated as between one-third and one-halfof the total of economic aid, is a net charge upon the balance ofpayments.     An even smaller proportion of military aid represents sucha charge.     The whole of both, however, constitute a burden on resources and on the Budget.-1-ECONOMIES IN GOVERNMENT OVERSEAS EXPENDITUREMinisters have directed that studies should he undertaken of ways of* achieving, in the f financial... year 1967/68, savings in Governmentforeign exchange expenditure of  100 million compared with expenditurein 1966/67 (the saving to he net of any overseas terminal paymentsnecessary as a direct consequence of the withdrawal of forces, ordiscontinuation of the use of defence or other facilities overseas, orcessation of aid whether military or civil);   and of the implications,military, political and economic of making such savings.2.    Possible savings are indicated below.   But these indicate,onlyrough orders of magnitude which may be liable to a very considerablemargin of error.   Likewise time has not permitted a full study of allthe implications of making the cuts.3. The main blocks of Government overseas expenditure, and the broadamounts in each case on 1966/67 estimates, are as follows -  millionDefence 287Military aid 23*
For the purpose of our studios wo have assumed that it is inevitable that defence should bear the larger part of any outs, and we have therefore considered possible means of achieving cuts in overseas defence expenditureof  50 million,  80 million and  100 million.   The two lower figures wouldenable account to be taken of the possibility of a contribution from theFederal German Government to the cost of stationing British forces inGermany, either of the full amount of  50 million which we have sought orof a lower amount, say  20 million.   It would also enable Ministers toconsider the option of a saving of  80 million on defence and  20 million oneconomic aid.   We have also considered possible savings in economic aidexpenditure of  20 million and  10 million, and in military aid of  5 million.These give further options of the ways in which the total can be achieved.Clearly more variations should ideally be considered, but any figures that could be offered in such a short time of such precise variations would not be worth having.5.     The results of these studies, item by item, are set out below.   Thereis, however, a difference in the timing of the practicability of cuts inthe field of aid on the one hand and defence on the other to which we must first draw attention.   In the long run, both defence and aid can be cut onthe basis of a judgment of our political and economic interests involved.In the short run, defence is more intractable than aid for purely practical reasons.   Provided we are prepared to accept the political and economic consequences both for others and for ourselves, it is possible to obtainwhatever cuts Ministers may decide on in capital aid by the next financialyear..   As regards defence, the sheer physical difficulties of transportingtroops and equipment in large quantities back to the United Kingdom, even if-2-
TOP SECRETwe were prepared to do it on the &quot;basis of a Dunkirk-type evacuation, OUwould mean many months work before the troops and equipment were allback in the United Kingdom and hence before the savings in overseaexpenditure were achieved.   Moreover, terminal payments, e.g. to localemployees (as with diplomatic and information establishments overseas),contracts and leases would, in the first year, offset a substantial partof the savings.   Finally, when hostilities are actually taking place, e.g.as they are for practical purposes at present in Aden and Borneo, withdrawalat the wrong time may involve the loss of British and Allied lives, and arealised as distinct from potential setback to our political aims.6.     We set out below the means by which, provided that Confrontation is seen to end by 1st January 1967* very substantial savings can be achieved in 1967/68, primarily from savings on defence.   Briefly these consist in bringing forward the achievement, broadly speaking, of the Defence Reviewforce levels for 1969/70 to mid 1967/68.   Subject to the ending of confrontation and the acceptance of significant political difficultiesthis can be done by being carried out hurriedly in a manner which will inevitably affect the terminal charges on foreign account and alsoincrease the United Kingdom budgetary burden.7.     We must, however, make it clear that the present defence proposalsinclude no margin for contingencies.   There is therefore no provisionfor meeting new commitments or any unforeseen contingencies that may occur between now and the end of that year.DEFENCE8.     The following table shows the effect of bringing forward the DefenceKeview targets by eighteen months as proposed above.Estimate JS^ST1966/67 final Defence Review_* force levelsGermany 94 97 (NB less presentoffset of  40 million)Mediterranean 38 23.5Middle East 27 10.5Malaysia, Singapore and Nepal 86 70.5Hong Kong 11 13   (excluding contribu-tion from Hong KongGovernment)Other Jjl^ 26.5TOTAL                      287 241DIFFERENCE   ..................     2j 
9.     This saving would he increased by whatever additional contribution is received from the Hong Kong Government which might bring the total to, say, 50 million.   On the other side account must be taken of the inevitabledifficulties of forecasting expenditure when making such a major change ona closely worked out plan.   This is bound to mean some additional expendi-ture.   Furthermore there will inevitably be substantial terminal charges,particularly through the bringing forward of the date and this may amountto several million pounds.   We think therefore it would be unwise to count on a saving of much more than  40 million by this means.10/  These are the savings which we think might be achieved by bringing forward the Pi/fence Review reductions.   We next consider what savings mightbe achieved in Germany.Europe and Defence Savings in Germany11.   Even the almost complete withdrawal of teeth arms and front-line aircraft from Germany would leave a balance of some  45 million in foreign exchange costs.   This relates to logistic backing (e.g. ports, line of communications and advance base facilities).   Moreover the present offset agreement, highly unsatisfactory though it is, does provide an offset of 40 million.   This clearly would not continue if we withdrew forces on a scale which suggested withdrawal from the Alliance and there would thereforebe a point where withdrawal, short of total withdrawal from the Alliance,would mean an addition which carried a net foreign exchange penalty.12.   Any reduction, however small, of our forces in Germany involves our obligations under the North Atlantic and Brussels Treaties.   There areprescribed procedures for seeking changes in these obligations.   In briefwe need either the agreement of a majority of our WED&quot; allies or if we arepleading financial strain a certificate of need from the North atlantic council.   In each case SACEUR8s views would have to be, sought.-4-TOP SECRET
-5-13.   NATO is at present trying to collect itself after the French defection.We have taken a leading part in holding the integrated defence systemtogether.   A unilateral withdrawal of a substantial part of our forces would be inconsistent with our attitude so far and would make integrateddefence impossible.   The effect would be e/en worse if we had to with drawour equipment and installations as well as our men, thus being in noposition to increase our force contribution again in an emergency.   Thiswould be tantamount to withdrawal from NATO.14.   Withdrawal of forces from Europe, leaving the German army preponderantv   there, is bound to affect our relations with the other European members of nato and to jeopardise the support which they have so far given to our european policy.   Moreover, in several cases, these are precisely thecountries on whom we rely for financial support for sterling.   this problem goes much wider than the effects on Anglo-German relations whichwoiild also undoubtedly be adverse.15.   The prospect of German agreement, in present circumstances, to meetthe whole gap of  50 million between our DM costs and present offsetseems to us small.   Some improvement should be possible.   We conclude, inthe light of all these considerations, that it would be unrealistic to expect that any sum approaching the full gap can be secured either from german sources or by withdrawal of forces.   A combination might be negotiated of additional German contributions and savings by withdrawalswhich could yield  15 to  20 million.   This would depend on German consent to continue (and improve) present offset in spite of the withdrawalsinvolved.Political Implications for other TheatresEar, East16.   The Defence Review was on the assumption that Confrontation would haveended before withdrawals took place.   Confrontation must have ended by 1st January, 19&amp;7 if Tre are &quot;to achieve the accelerated defence run-down.
If before Confrontation is clearly ended we move troops or show that we intend to, then:(a) We should concede victory to Indonesia just when the new Indonesian government seem prepared for a negotiated settlement;   and we should throwaway all that we have fought for over the last three years.(b) We should be seen to be dishonouring our commitments under theDefence Agreement with Malaysia.(c) Malaysia would have no alternative but to make the best terms sheoould with Indonesia in humiliating circumstances;    she might well decide that her only course was to throw in her lot entirely with Indonesia andeject us from our bases in Malaysia.(d) We have committed ourselves to the United States, Australia andNew Zealand to stay in Malaysia and Singapore as long as we can.   Thefacilities which Australia and New Zealand use in Malaysia and Singaporewould be put at risk and their troops in Borneo would have to withdrawwith ours.   They would doubt our willingness to maintain a military presence in the Par East.17*   President Sukarno may well be able to continue to hold up ratification of the Bangkok agreement should there seem to Indonesia to be prospects of victory falling into their hands if they hold on a little longer.In there circumstances in order to achieve, under satisfactory conditions,an early major reduction of our forces, we need to make it clear to the indonesian Government that friendly relations and the withdrawal of our forces from Borneo are available to them if, but only if, they ratify andca?ry out the Bangkok agreement.18.   Reductions on the scale of the full programme will have majorrepercussions on the Singapore economy;   the Singapore Government willinsist on aid to counter this as a quid pro quo for our retaining the base.There is no provision for this even on the present aid programme, let alone on a reduced one.-6-
Hong Kong19.   Hong Kong provides a special problem.   The present defence contributionfalls short of meeting the cost of those of the units which are stationed in hong Kong for purposes of internal security.   The total cost of these amountsto  5*5 million and it is proposed to seel: an additional contribution fromthe Hong Kong Government which would meet the gap.Middle East20.   The saving from the Middle East implies no change in present plans for withdrawal from South Arabia.   Earlier withdrawal of fighting units would increase the risk of leaving behind an unstable successor State,and therefore inviting early Egyptian intervention.   It might even leadto the need for a fighting withdrawal with loss of equipment etc.   Chaosor an Egyptian takeover immediately following our departure would gravelythreaten the stability of the Persian Gulf area.Persian Gulf21,   Apart from the military disadvantages of changing the Defence Reviewdecision and leaving the Persian Gulf, a decision to leave would have the short-term political effect of risking international chaos in the Gulf areawith the rival ambitions of Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.   Whatever the outcome, this could disrupt oil production in the short term and could,therefore, impose a heavy new foreign exchange loss on the United Kingdom.Mediterranean22,   In our costing of the accelerated run-down to Defence Review forcelevels we have assumed that we shall be proceeding with present plans to complete the run-down of British forces in Malta by mid-1968.   We havealso assumed the retention of the Dhekelia stockpile until mid-1968.   the accelerated run-down should not therefore have any implications for Malta,Cyprus and Libya over and above those already foreseen, bui; not yetexamined by Ministers, as a result of the Defence Review.    These are however considerable.
23.   Completion of the Defence Review reductions will have the mostsevere effects on the Maltese economy involving an increase in umemployment there to some 15-20 per cent.   Mien we consult Malta (aswe are committed to do under the Defence Agreement) we must expect themto react strongly.   We may at least have to consider a renewal orenlargement of the special immigration quota into this country and increased opportunities for employment in the British forces,Cyprus24*   Since the run-down will he unrelated to progress towards a Cyprussettlement, it will inject a new element of instability into the situationwhich might lead to an armed clash between Greece and Turkey.  .Tn particularour run-down would probably make it impracticable for a United nations force to operate in Cyprus, if this was still in existence in 1968.Conclusion on Economies from Defence25.   The conclusion of the preceding paragraphs is that we might hope to achieve economies of some  40 million net by advancing the date of theDefence Review run-down (assuming Confrontation is seen to end by 1st January, 1967), and a further  15/20 million in respect of Germany.If we fail to obtain the  15/20 million from Germany and further economiesare sought from defence, the following are the implications.26.   A further saving from defence costs of  30 million could only beachieved either by withdrawing half our effective units from G-ermany and thereby endangering NATO or by reducing force levels in the Ear East tolittle more than a token military presence which would serve littlepurpose.   The same reduction could be achieved by a cut of about halfthese amounts in both G-ermany and the Ear East, but this v^ould resultin the worst of both vrorlds.-8-
27.   A further  20 million would only he added to this saving by with-drawing virtually all our troops from Germany, or virtually.all our troops from the Par East, or by total withdrawal from Cyprus and the Persian Gulf.If any of these measures were to he adopted, our military capability wouldbe drastically affected and in the area concerned would disappear altogether.This would involve a total reappraisal of our external policies.   We cannot in the time available say whether it would be possible in fact to makewithdrawals on this scale to affect significantly the financial positionin 1967/68.General28.   The accelerated run-down can hardly fail to entail considerable further strain upon the members of the forces and particularly on their families by hurried arrangements for departure, by increased periods of separation and by makeshift arrangements for accommodation both for theforces and for their families in the United Kingdom, and would also raise a serious training problem.   All this may have a significant effect upon the morale of the forces generally.
eccnoiiic, aid29.   The table shows the distribution of estimated disbursements for1967/8 between the main heads and illustrates how cuts of  10 million and 20 million might fall -PRESENTESTIMATEDDISBURSEMENTS REVISED REVISED	for 1967/8	CUT	TOTAL	CUT	TOTAL		on  10m. basis		on  20m. basis	Colonies	13,2	.5	12.7	1.	12.2So^th^Arabia	9.4	.5	8.9	1.	.8.4Commonwealth Xexcept India and Pakistan)	66.8	3.5	63.3	6.45	60.35India and Pakistan	64.3	2.5	61.8	5.	59.foreign	23.4	3..	20.4	5.35	18.05Bilateral Technical A^ssi^taaio^e	38.1		38.1	.5	37.6Multilateral	25.9	.7	25.2	1.4	24.5CDC	12.2	1.	11.2	2.	10.2Civil Aerodromes	.8	.4	.4	.4	,grand Total	254J	(12,1)	242.0	(23.1)	231.0timating adjustment	30.		27.(say)		26.

The figure of  225 million is the gross figure for estimateddisbursements for both 1966/67 and i967/68,     The difference between this figure and the  195 million shown in paragraph 3 is accountedfor by estimated capital repayments of  30 million.2.   The estimates of disbursement allow for an &quot;estimatingadjustment&quot; which experience has shown to be necessary, sincedisbursements always fall short of forecasts owing to factorsoutside our control (e,g. delays on the part of recipientgovernments).     The estimate of total disbursements thereforeexceeds  225 million and the amounts required to produce thenecessary cuts are slightly higher than  10 million and  20 million.
30.    The aid ceiling is at present fixed in cash terms - i,e, unlike otheroivil expenditure programmes it has not been revised since last year toallow for rising costs.     The latest estimates of disbursements to coverexisting commitments and policies for 1967/68 add up to approxnmately 225 million, with virtually no provision for contingencies.     It will therefore be necessary, after applying any cut which Ministers may decideupon for the total programme, to reduce some of the, iidividual itemsfurther in order to make some provision for unforeseeable contingencies,as   experience suggests to be necessary,^olbSJT^^^^d^rjyQS,31.   Our special responsibilities make cuts particularly difficult, since they receive aid only from us.     Most of the remaining Colonies are grantaided and little or no reduction is possible in budgetary aid.     The cuts would therefore fall disproportionately on development aid.     The effect would be increased by the probable need to increase our aid to Gibraltar&apos;,Sojrih^Jhrabia32.   It would ne necessary to reduce the provisions which Ministersrecently agreed as necessary to ensure the possibility of orderlyindependence and the safe withdrawal of oirr troops.c p :^p^wealth jrth^er^^tj^an Indja and Pakistan33*   In. many of these countries we are virtually the only donor and any action on our part has a crucial effect on their economies.     We also havea number of heavy budgetary aid responsibilities which we cannot suddenlyreduce.     A cut of  20 million would iivolve substantial withdrawal fromcommitments or near-commitments both in Africa and elsewhere.     departments are not agreed how cuts should be made and further discussion will be needed. W
-12-India34.   A cut of  2 million would come at a time when India has just agreed with the World Bank to devalue her currency and liberalise her import programme on the understanding that aid would be increased.     The WorldBank assessment is that India needs a substantial increase in aid quite apart from the immediate needs created by the present drought (for whichwe have given virtually no additional aid) and the requirement forrefinancing debt to which we are in principle committed.     A cut of 4 million involved in a total cut of  20 million would mean a choice between our discontinuing or postponing the Durgapur project, or reducinggeneral aid to sustain the economy.     Any cut would create the impression that we were disregarding her own very serious economic crisis.foreign Oountries35.&apos; Our aid to most individual countries is relatively small, thoughcrucial in some cases (e.g. Turkey), so that the main adverse effects ofcuts would be political and commercial.     A cut of  10 million wouldinvolve the withdrawal of an outstanding loan offer to Colombia of 1 million and the slowing down in disbursements of loans to the Sudanand Ethiopia;   a cut of ;S20 million would also involve reducing aid toLaos and to Turkey and slowing down aid to Iran.35-A. Relatively small cuts are proposed in view of the importance which ministers have attached to supporting United Nations activities.     A totalcut of  20 million would involve the deletion or postponement of our contribution to the World Food Programme (which Ministers have decided against in the past) or a reduction in our contribution to the united nations Development Programme.     Both would be unprecedented departuresin policy.
-13-ffpnmionwealth Development Corporation35B. Cuts of the size proposed would interfere with the Corporations capacity to undertake new business, without which it cannot continue to operate effectively or acceptably to the countries concerned.     It is one of themost efficient ways of giving economic aid, combining productive -investment,good management and training for local people.     It attracts foreign capital and promotes British exports.Cpnpljisipns36.   Either level of cuts would have serious effects on overseas economic development and on our relations with the countries of Africa, Asia andLatin America, but a cut of  20 million would have disproportionatelyseverer implications.     Most of the cuts would oblige us to go back on, orto defer the implementation of, pledges or expectations which we have encouraged on the basis of aid policies previously agreed upon by Ministers.A number of very poor countries would be severely hampered in their economic progress.     Even in our present economic situation these countries would regard a big cut in our aid programme as showing a lack of appreciation of their own persistent and acute economic problems and asfalling short of our international commitments in this field.37.   The precise distribution of any cuts would require much furtherinterdepartmental examination, and the above are only illustrations ofwhat would be involved.3&amp;*   Ministers may feel that in the context of the defence cuts mentioned. in paragraph 8 above, a cut of  10 million in aid, difficult though it is,must be accepted in present circumstances.     Beyond that point, thedifficulties get progressively greater, and a cut of  20 million would create severe difficulties.
-14-MILZP/iBY. AID39.     Estimates for the current year amount to  24.7 million.   Wobelieve that a reduction of  4*6&quot; million could be achieved.In addition there will be a further saving if a frigate now being builtfor Ghana on loan terms can be sold elsewhere.   Of the remainder theL?.rg03t part is accounted for by South Arabia.   Any cut in aid to south Arabia would endanger the orderly withdrawal of our own forces.Smaller sums relate to that part of our aid to India to which vie areformally committed, and the cost of loaned personnel to Malaysia needed to maintain Malaysian security after the end of confrontation and thewithdrawal of our forces from Borneo.SUBSCRIPTIONS TO,jNTERNATIONAL ORGANISATIONS. DIPLOMATIC SERVICEADMINISTRATION, mp^IM/iTION; SERVICES40.    No saving is obtainable in respect of subscriptions to international organisations, save by withdrawal, cutting unilaterally our rate of sub-scription or falling into arrears.   We have found no organisation fromwhich we think we should withdraw.  . We assume we cannot face cutting down our contribution to the peace-keeping activities of UNFICYP (CyprusForce) or UNEF (Israel-Egyptian Border).   The other courses would involveimmense difficulties for negligible savings.41.    The diplomatic service and information services have already under-gone stringest economies in the estimates for the current year.   Even in existing circumstances we can recommend only a further small saving.   We donot recommend it should be sought by closing posts.   For example, to closefour of our smallest posts in Latin America would produce a net saving of only about  40,000; but would leave some  7 million   of exports and    11 14 million of United Kingdom capital investments unattended to.
42.     Savings would be better made by a combination of reducing or delay-ing building programmes, by certain economies in overseas information and the work of the British Council, and by certain personnel reductions.We estimate these savings would total some  1 million in the financial year1967-68.PAYMENT OVERSEAS OF VARIOUS PENSIONS43*     No saving is possible short cf default.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS44-   Ministers have instructed us to consider how  100 million can &quot;be saved in 1567/68 on Government expenditure overseas.   This saving must come almost entirely from defence and economic aid.   There are two majoruncertainties.   The first is whether we can obtain a significant Vcontribution from Germany and the second is whether Confrontation is seen to have ended in time.45.   Now that Confrontation looks like ending earlier than could beexpected at the time of the Defence Review, the date for the reductionin force levels can be brought forward in the Far East by eighteen,months.This is, however, absolutely dependent on the ending of Confrontation by 1st January, 1967*   This coupled with the run-down in the mediterranean and the Middle East should achieve a net saving of  40 million in 1967/68.Certain risks to our political position are involved and are brought outin paragraphs 16-24.46.   Some further savings can be extracted:    10 million from economic aid,nearly  5 million from military aid and about  1 million from the diplomatic service and information services.   These could bring the total saving to something over  55 million.47.   Even a saving of this order involves substantial political and other difficulties.   These .are set out in paragraphs 16-24, 28 and 31-38.48.     If we were to get as much as  50 million from Germany we should then have achieved the target, but we think this is most unlikely and we therefore consider other means of achieving it.49.     We might get a saving from Germany of  15-20 million, partly by anadditional German contribution and partly by some .agreed withdrawal of forces,thus bringing the total saving to  70-75 million.   Such agreement would ofcourse preclude any other withdrawals from Germany, except by imperilling thewhole of the enlarged offset agreement and thereby incurring a foreign exchangwpenalty.
Cabinet Office, S.W.I.,July, 1966.-17-50.     To achieve a further saving of  25-30 million, thus reaching the target,would mean a cut in aid of e.g. a further  5 or  10 million, coupled withsuch a reduction of our forces in the Far East that without much further study (which is already in progress) we cannot say whether they would thenserve any useful purpose.     The alternative of a total withdrawal from thePersian Gulf would risk international chaos in this area with a consequentdisruption of oil production in the short-term and would interfere with our communications to the Far East.51.     If we get no additional help from Germany at all, the financial and practical limitations in respect of what we can do &quot;by way of withdrawingforces from Germany are:(a) Short of withdrawal from the Alliance we cannot remove basefacilities and installations and these cost about  4-5 million in foreign exchange.(b) Even if we could bring back all our teeth arms without this being held to constitute such withdrawal we should undoubtedly forfeitour offset agreement from which we get about  4-0 million .Moreover there are practical limitations to the numbers whichcan be accommodated and trained in the United Kingdom in the short run.52.     We have nevertheless considered the possibilities of obtaining thefurther sum required to meet the target of  100 million by withdrawing all our forces from Germany,   We have also considered the implications ofobtaining the whole amount by withdrawal from the Far East.   The political implications of these courses are set out in paragraphs 26-27.
