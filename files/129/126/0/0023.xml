THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1966C (66) 123 Copy No.    6 729th July, 1966CABINETTHE NEED FOR AN INQUIRY INTO ASSIZES ANDQUARTER SESSIONSMemorandum by the Lord chancellor the administration of justice outside London, both in criminaland in civil proceedings, has for centuries been dependent on theexistence of the Circuit system whereby the Judges of The Queen&apos;bench Division are required to visit every county in England andWales at least twice a year for the purpose of holding Assizes. Theimportant part which the Assize system has played in thedevelopment of English institutions is a matter of commonknowledge, but what is perhaps less well-known is the length of timefor which complaints have been heard about the wastefulness andinefficiency of the system. As long ago as 1869 the JudicatureCommission remarked that the distribution of a small amount ofbusiness among a large number of circuit towns was the causeof serious evil to the suitors and the Commission accordingly recommended the consolidation of several counties into districts forthe trial of civil and criminal cases. However, no action was taken and a similar fate awaited the proposals made by a Council of judges in 1892 for the grouping of civil cases at 18 centres throughoutEngland and Wales. The recommendations made by the GorellCommittee in 1908 and the St. Aldwyn Royal Commission in 1913were equally unsuccessful. It is therefore not surprising that in thelight of the history of these and later inquiries the Peel RoyalCommission on the Despatch of Business at Common Law (Cmd.5065) reached the conclusion in 1936 that attempts to abandon thecounty basis of the Assize system stood no chance of success,although it is fair to add that the Peel Commission itself thoughtthat the county basis should be retained.2. There has been no radical inquiry into the Assize systemsince the Peel Commission reported. The Evershed Committee onSupreme Court Practice and Procedure, in its First Interim Reportpublished in 1949 (Cmd. 7764), considered the possibility of fixingdates for the trial of civil actions at Assizes but concluded that thiswas impossible so long as the existing circuit system remained unchanged. The Streatfeild Committee on the Business of the criminal Courts, which reported in 1961 (Cmnd. 1289), was not7090A
invited to consider any fundamental alterations in the Assize system,its primary task on this side of its inquiry being to see what couldbe done to reduce the delays in bringing accused persons to trial.It is true that the Streatfeild Committee did recommend some important changes in the arrangements for holding Assizes, which resulted in many of the more important Assize towns being visitedby the Judges four times a year and in the holding of Assizessimultaneously at more than one town on a Circuit. The implement-tation of these and other recommendations made by the StreatfeildCommittee has undoubtedly been of some value in enabling the judges to deal with the heavy increase in crime and in reducing the delays in the trial of criminal cases at Assizes as well as at quarter sessions.3. Fundamentally, however, the system remains much the sameas it has always been. There are still 61 Assize towns which mustbe visited by the Judges at least twice a year. Some of these areplaces at which there is often little or no business or where, on theother hand, the time available is quite insufficient for the trial of along case. The present Assize towns are listed in the Annex to thismemorandum and my colleagues will see at once that many of the mare places at which one would not consider the holding of an Assizeif one were free to start afresh. It is not surprising to find that the discontinuance of Assizes at such places as Appleby, Huntingdonand Oakham in England and Beaumaris, Mold and Presteign in wales should have been recommended by Committees in the past.Yet the Judges are still required to visit these towns, while largecentres of population elsewhere remain without any adequate facilities for the local trial of civil cases outside the jurisdiction ofthe County Courts and accused persons often have to travel longdistances for trial.4. The results are very much what one would expect. So far ascivil cases are concerned, the universal complaint is of over-crowdedlists and cases having to be postponed from one Assize to the nextand sometimes to the next but one. In such conditions the fixing of dates for trial is, as the Evershed Committee found, virtually impossible and litigants, witnesses, counsel and solicitors waste aninordinate amount of time in waiting for their cases to come on. Sofar as criminal cases are concerned, it is true that, following the changes recommended by the Streatfeild Committee, much has beendone to reduce the waiting period before trial, but this often has tobe achieved at the expense of civil cases and at the cost of commitalsto courts which may be some considerable distance from the magistrates&apos; court at which the charge was first heard. The generaldissatisfaction at the present state of affairs was most recently voicedby the Lord Chief Justice at the Judges&apos; Dinner at the MansionHouse on 30th June, when he urged the need for a radical reductionin the number of Assize towns.5. I am satisfied that we now need a far-reaching inquiryby a strong Royal Commission. I should like to see this body givenwide terms of reference which would enable it to consider not only
the re-organisation of the Assize system, but also the desirabilityof setting up district High Courts outside London. It should also,no doubt, have power to consider the extension of the Crown Courtsystem on the lines of that existing at Liverpool and Manchester,although this was not recommended by the Streatfeild Committeeand I am not myself in favour of it. I think the commission should also be asked to look into the arrangements for theadministration of justice at Quarter Sessions, which now tend to be over-loaded as the result of the increase in crime and the extendedjurisdiction which they have recently been given following on therecommendations of the Streatfeild Committee, in consequence ofwhich it is becoming more and more difficult for busy members ofthe Bar to act as Recorders and for barristers and solicitors to actas Chairmen and deputy Chairmen of Quarter Sessions. Animportant part of the Commission^ task will be to consider the availability of court accommodation and the arrangements for housing the Assize Judges: difficulties about accommodation ofevery kind at present play a wholly disproportionate part in determining the pattern of our court system at all levels.6. Previous attempts to reform the Assize system have usuallyfoundered on local opposition to proposals that a particular townshould lose its Assize. No doubt strong feelings are still entertainedon this score, many of them proceeding from motives which areentitled to respect, but I do not think that such feelings should any longer be allowed to stand in the path of reform. Moreover, I think we may well find that there is less opposition to change under this head than used to be the case, for many local authorities are to-dayfinding the cost of supporting an Assize a heavy financial burden.I have little doubt that an announcement of an early inquiry willbe widely welcomed.7. The Home Affairs Committee agreed on 22nd July (H (66)18th Meeting, Minute 4) that an inquiry by a Royal commission was highly desirable, but invited me to reconsider its scope and terms of reference in consultation with the Home Secretary andthe Financial Secretary to the Treasury. I have now done this andwe agree in thinking that the Commission should be asked &quot; to inquire into the present arrangements for the administration ofjustice at Assizes and at Quarter Sessions outside Greater Londonand to report what reforms should be made for the more convenient, economic and efficient disposal of the civil and criminalbusiness at present dealt with by those courts &quot;. These terms ofreference will enable the Commission to consider not only thepresent organisation and jurisdiction of Assizes and Quarter Sessionsbut also the desirability of any changes in the deployment of the judges, for instance by the setting up of provincial High Courts.G.House of Lords, S.W.1,27th July, 1966.7090
