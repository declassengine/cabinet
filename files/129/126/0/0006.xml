TIGHTENING OF BUILDING control memorandum by the Ministry of Public Building and works the Proposal1.      The proposal under consideration is to lower from 100,CCC to  50,000 the limit above which types of worknot exempted by legislation will become subject to licensed-sing by the Minister of Public Building and Works whenthe Building Control Bill becomes law.2.     With the limit at  100,000 the projects falling within the scope of the control will number annuallyabout 500 at a total capital value of  180 m.    A reduc-tion in the limit to  50,000 would bring in another 500projects at a total capital value of  40 m.Method of Proceeding3.      The Building Control Bill enters the Committee stage in the House of Lords on July 18th.    On present plans theRoyal Assent is expected on August 4th.    Since theChancellor&apos;s announcement on 2?th July 1%5 the Minister&apos;sacts and authorisations in the field of licensing havebeen without statutory backing and have relied on the goodwill of the construction industry and its clients.4.     A change in the limit to  50,000 could be made -(a) by making an Order (which could not be retro-spective) immediately after the Royal Assenthas been received;    or(b) by amending the Bill so as to substitute 50,000 for  100,000 - and perhaps substituting,say,  25,000 for the  50,000 to ivhich theMinister may at present reduce the statutory limit by Order;    or(c) by acting as in (b) but making it retrospectiveto the date of the forthcoming comprehensiveGovernment policy announcement.5.      Courses (b) and (c) would involve ensuring that theHouse of Lords would pass the necessary amendment andre-committing the Bill to the House of Commons and delaying the date of the Royal Assent.6.      Course (c) would also mean introducing a secondelement of retrospection into a Bill that has already given rise to controversy in the House of Commons inthis respect.7.      On balance, course (a) seems preferable.    There is some risk of forestalling by building owners, but this might not turn out in practice to affect a very largenumber of projects.    Forestalling could be preventedaltogether if the proposal to make the Order were notstated in specific terms at the time of the comprehensivepolicy statement.1.
Specific impact of the change8.      To lower the limit to  5C,C0C would not of itselfaffect the volume of privately sponsored construction.It would give the Government more freedom of manoeuvrefor the future,  though it would carry the clear implications-tion that the level at which   private building could beheld with the limit at  ICG,GOO was more than theGovernment considered acceptable.9.      Since November 1965 the Minister has issued authori-sations at the rate of  8 m.  per month.    Gnly  9 m. worth of projects have so far been rejected outright,, but manyhave been given deferred starting dates.    One effect ofthis is that by this autumn the Minister will be refusing50% of applications.    The control will then, therefore,be seen to bite much more strongly that it probablyappears to the public to be doing at present.10.    Many of the applications are strongly supported bythe Government Departments concerned as being for essential purposes.    (Housing, industrial building andprojects in Development Districts are exempt in any case.)The Ministry&apos;s view is that if the Government wish toreduce the level below that resulting from approval of50/o of applications,  the limit ought to be lowered to 50,000 in order that less essential projects in the 50,00G- 100,000 range may be deferred rather than themost important projects above  100,000.11.    About 25% of the present applications for licencesare in respect of offices.    This means that inco-operation with the Board-of Trade the Ministry cansignificantly affect the pattern and pace of office building at only a small cost in Civil Service manpower.General considerations12.    Early this month it was estimated that in &apos; 196? thetotal demand,  public and private, on the construction industry for new work would be nearly 6% higher   than in1966.    Except for private housing the increase was attributable to the public sector.    It was thought thatthis level of demand might exceed output by 2%-5%,i.e.  50 m.- 75 m. &apos;13.    Since then the Chancellor has announced a limit onbank loans, raised the Bank Rate and required specialdeposits with the Bank of England.    In view of these measures - and with further reductions in the public sector in prospect - the capacity of the construction industry in 1967 seems certain to exceed demand.    Iftherefore the Government&apos;s aim is to hold a balance between supply and demand in the construction industry,the limit of  company,CCC should remain unchanged.    If theGovernment wish to divert resources from the industryover and above any diversions that may result from the selective Employment Tax,  a lowering of the limit to 50,000 (and a tightening of the control accordingly)would contribute usefully to the process.14.    To lower the limit would bring more private sectorprojects (including a good number of office projects)within the scope of licensing and would demonstrate theGovernments intention to impose further restraint onthe private as well as the public sector.2.TOP SECRET
15.    On the other hand, the change would aim anotherblow at an industry which sees an apparent contradictionbetween the expansion to which it is urged under theNational Economic Flan ana the Pleasures, particularlyS.E.T.,  specifically aimed at it by the Government duringthe last twelve months.    If other considerations allow,there is a case for urging that the construction industry,which is a potentially important contributor to economic growth;  should not be deprived of the conditions in whichthere is a reasonable incentive to modernisation and greater efficiency.iiLambeth Bridge House.S.E. 166.
