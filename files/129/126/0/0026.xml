REORGANISATION OF THE SHIPBUILDING industry memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI believe it is essential that the Government should announce their decisions on the Geddes Report before the Recess.2.      The Geddes Report, which was published in March, recommended radical reorganisation of the shipbuilding industry, the abandonment of restrictive practices, and financial and other assistance from theGovernment.    The main proposal was that we should set up anindependent Shipbuilding Industry Board with powers to make loansover a period of five years up to a maximum of  32f million, and grants of up to  5 million, to facilitate the concentration of theexisting twenty-seven major yards into four or five large groups.3.      The Report proposed that both sides in the industry should begiven three months from the publication of the report to give their considered reactions to its recommendations, and that the Governmentshould then announce their decisions in the following month.    I madea statement in March, on behalf of the Government, and by agreementwith my colleagues, welcoming the general Geddes approach andundertaking that we would play our part in implementing it, if bothsides in the industry were prepared to play their part.    On this basis both management and unions have now committed themselves tothe reorganisation of the industry, although this commitment is dependent on the Government carrying out their share of the package.The unions have already accepted a number of inter changeabilityagreements and one major demarcation agreement.4.       At their meeting on 22nd July the Ministerial Committee on productivity agreed that we should go ahead broadly on the lines whichGeddes recommended.    My colleagues had serious misgivings aboutmaking an announcement at present so soon after the Prime ministers statement of 20th July on the ground that Government financialassistance was involved.    Although we should only be committing ourselves to expenditure in due (mainly in the financial year1968-69 and later), it was feared by some that a decision to find 37^ million for shipbuilding might be contrasted, both at home andabroad, with our measures to restrict public and private spending.5.      I consider that there are strong practical and presentationalreasons for making the statement now.    The industry cannot make further progress with reorganisation until the proposed shipbuilding industry Board is set up on a non-statutory basis.     Unless theGovernment show that they intend to follow up the Report with the-1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 126 COPY NO.     jjjj2nd August, 1966CABINET
sense of urgency that Gedd-es recommended, the fresh start in industrial relations which the industry has been trying to make willfalter.    Confidence in the industry&apos;s future will be sapped and thiswill weaken both its current financial position and its ability to bookfurther orders.    The Geddes proposals were essentially a programme with a timetable as well as a package; the proposed government statement was supposed to have been made in July.6.       Everything we have said about the report has led the industryand public to expect a statement; and we have no more reason to defer a statement on this than on other measures like the establish-ment of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation, which will not involve immediate expenditure, and are necessary to the improve-ment of productivity.    &quot;v/e can offer no adequate reason for puttingthis back in view of our claim that the transfer of responsibility forthe industry will not upset or delay the follow up of the Report.    It is,I believe, a confusion of thought to suppose that measures to promoteindustrial productivity ought to be held up in order to restrict theuse of public money.    V/e are far more likely to be criticised, andrightly, for failing to press on with positive proposals for enhancingproductivity, of which this is one of the most promising now open tous.    In any case only small amounts of money will be involved overthe next 2 years.7,      I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that I should beauthorised to make a statement before the Recess confirming theGovernments intention to play its part in the reorganisation of theindustry on the lines agreed at the Productivity Committee.D. P. T. J.Board of Trade, S. W. 1.2nd August, 1966-2-
