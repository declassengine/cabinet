S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)SOCIAL WORK SERVICES IN SCOTLAND:  DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland on 21st July the Committee on Social Services approved thedraft of a White Paper setting out proposals for the reorganisation of thelocal authority social work services in Scotland and recommended its early publication.     The Chief Secretary, Treasury, proposed, however,that publication of the White Paper should for political reasons be post-poned for a time.    I consulted the Prime Minister, who suggested thatthe White Paper should be published early in October and that it shouldbe circulated to Cabinet for information during the last part of September,I arn therefore circulating the paper herewith and am making arrange-ments to publish it,2.       The White Paper follows my announcement last year accei3tingthe main recommendations of the Kilbrandon Committee on Children and young Persons (Scotland).    It provides some information about thechildren&apos;s panels which will be set up on the lines suggested in theKilbrandon Report, but its main purpose is to set out as a basis fordiscussion with local authority and professional bodies proposals forreorganising the social work services.     These proposals have been drawn up after some discussion with representatives of the localauthority associations, but the associations are in no way committed to them.    I have also had the valuable advice of Professor R.M. Titmussand of two leading professional social workers in Scotland, a.nd theseadvisers are in broad agreement with the proposals.3.       The main proposal is that all the local authority social workservices should be brought together in a single department of the localauthority.     These are the services whose organisation in England andWales is being considered by the Seebohm Committee, but I do not think we should be deterred by the possibility that the future organisation ofthese services might differ in some respects on the two sides of the border.   As the Longford Committee pointed out, mere is a good case for separate schemes in Scotland and England.4.       The White Paper is in three parts.    The first explains the case for reorganising the social work services, and stresses the need for amore positive approach to community problems by all local authoritydepartments and by the public generally.     The second examines the mainservices provided by local authorities to assist with social and personaldifficulties, and discusses which of them should become part of the newsocial work department.     The third part of the paper describes how thenew department would work with children in difficulties, and how thechildren&apos;s panels would come into the picture when some form of compulsion seemed necessary.    The cost of the proposals is modestin relation to the benefits which they would bring.C(66) 13426th September, 1966COPY NO.CABINET

ForewordThis paper puts forward proposals framed by the Govern-ment following the Report of the Committee on Children and young Persons (Scotland) under the chairmanship of LordKilbrandon, which was published in April 1964 (Cmnd. 2306).The proposals are presented as a basis for discussion withinterested persons and organisations, with a view to com-prehensive legislation when opportunity offers.Part I sets out the main lines of the proposals and envisagesa new local authority Social Work Department. Part II dealswith the services for which that Department should be respon-sible. Part III describes how the new Department would work with children and their parents, and how that work wouldrelate to the work of the children&apos;s panels which are to be setup on the lines recommended by the Kilbrandon Committee.
Social Work and the CommunityProposals for ReorganisingLocal Authority Services in Scotland/. The Government&apos;s proposals the background of the review. The Kilbrandon Committee recommended the setting up of two neworganisations to deal with children who, because of delinquency or for someother reason, are in need of special measures of education and training. One wasa system of panels of lay persons, with certain powers of compulsion and withcontinuing responsibility for the children brought before them, which would replace existing juvenile courts. The other was a &quot;social education department&quot;of the education authority, formed by the merger of existing organisations concerned with children&apos;s special needs which would provide all the facilitiesnecessary for the care, treatment and training of these children.2. Following publication of the Committee&apos;s Report, the Secretary of Stateinvited a large number of bodies, including local authority associations and professional associations, to submit observations on its recommendations. the many observations received showed that a majority of interested bodies favouredsetting up a system of panels on the lines recommended, and the consequentabolition of juvenile courts. The majority favoured also the reorganisation of theservices concerned with the care and special training of children, but thoughtthat the resulting new organisation should be more widely based, catering forfamilies as well as children, and that therefore it could not appropriately be partof the education authority. After considering these observations the Secretaryof State announced during the summer of 1965 that the Government proposedto bring forward legislation for the establishment in Scotland of children&apos;spanels on the lines recommended by the Kilbrandon Committee. He said alsothat he had invited the local authority associations to form with his Departmentsa working group to draw up reorganisation proposals for the local authoritysocial work services, and that his Departments would, in working out these proposals, have the benefit of the advice of Professor R. M. Titmuss,Professor of Social Administration, London School of Economics, Miss M.Browne, Department of Social Study, University of Edinburgh and Mrs. C. M.Carmichael, School of Social Study, University of Glasgow. The recommen-dations of the Kilbrandon Committee have now been considered further in thelight of the valuable advice given by the working group and by the independentadvisers, and in the context of the Government^ policy for the social service as a whole.3. The merger of the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance and theNational Assistance Board is now proceeding, and the new Ministry of social security will be concerned with the provision of financial support to thosefamilies and individuals who need it. The review of social work services has not therefore touched on these services but has dealt almost entirely with local
authority services which, whether or not they have powers to give assistance in cash and in kind in certain circumstances, are concerned principally with theprovision of advice and support in resolving personal and social difficulties. Tothe extent that help of this kind forms part of the medical care provided by thegeneral practitioner and hospital services, however, it has not been included inthe scope of this review.4. Valuable work is done also by a variety of voluntary social work agencies,and the Government hope that these agencies will wish to continue to develop their work in co-operation with local authorities whenever appropriate. Thepowers of the Secretary of State and of local authorities to give financialassistance to voluntary bodies will be continued.5. Before this review had been completed the appointment of a RoyalCommission on the reorganisation of local government had been announced.It would have been possible to await the recommendations of the Royal Corn-mission before considering how the local authority social work services shouldbe organised in future. But early decisions on this matter are essential both tothe setting up of children&apos;s panels and to the development of the social services in general, and in order to avoid unnecessary delay the Government decided toproceed at once with the review of the local authority social work services.Action which results from the review must clearly be compatible with the present organisation of local government and must also be capable of adjustment to fitinto the future pattern.6. One further important factor had to be borne in mind continuously in this review. The services with which it is concerned are all under-manned, and are particularly short of fully trained staff. A major effort to attract, recruit and,when necessary, train staff is essential. But however great the effort and howeversuccessful it may be in improving recruitment, there is unlikely to be a dramaticimprovement in staffing in the next few years. One of the main reasons forreorganising the services is to enable them to make a more rational and more effective deployment of staff. If this more effective deployment is achieved, it follows that the present staff will be able to provide a better service than now.Further improvements in the services can be expected to follow as additional staff are recruited and trained.The powers of local authorities7. The existing powers of local authorities to provide advice and assistance,and to promote welfare, are set out mainly in the National Health Service(Scotland) Act 1947, the National Assistance Act 1948, the Children Act 1948,the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1960, the Education (Scotland) Act 1962 andthe Children and Young Persons Act 1963. These powers will be continued,with the adjustments necessary to fit the new organisation. They are already very wide, and only two substantial groups of people appear not to be fullycovered. Services for old people under the National Assistance Act are limitedto the provision of accommodation, meals and recreation. For adults who are notaged, handicapped, ill or parents of young children, there is at present noexpress power by which a local authority may at its own hand provide personaladvice arid guidance. It is proposed that the local authority should in future havepower to provide all citizens, of whatever age or circumstances, with advice and guidance in the solution of personal and social difficulties and problems.
The need for reorganisation fe8. The main defects in the present organisation of the local authority social work and welfare services derive essentially from the fact that these services have been developed piecemeal and in response to the identification at differenttimes of certain groups of people who needed social help, e.g. deprived children,handicapped persons, old people. When it was established, each service was naturally seen as aiming at the alleviation of a social problem different in kindfrom that dealt with by any other service. Experience, growing knowledge of human needs, and development of techniques have brought to light a numberof factors which now seem much more important than before.(1) Whatever their immediate disability or difficulty, people can seldomovercome it by personal efforts alone. The majority of people tackle it inco-operation with, and with the support of, their family and community.But there is a minority who need help of the kind that the social workservices can give to establish and strengthen the personal and socialrelationships which can provide this co-operation and support.(2) Troubles seldom come singly. Many situations in which social work helpis needed are complicated, and the families concerned are liable to be involved with and visited by a number of services each trying to help with one aspect of the difficulty and often overlapping each other.(3) Social workers in all the services agree that they require to use basicallythe same skills. Specialised knowledge and experience are often necessary,but the body of expertise necessary to all social workers is substantially the same.(4) The various services employing social workers have to compete among themselves for the limited numbers of trained staff available, and entrants to social work training are obliged to decide, often prematurely, in whichservice or specialisation they wish to work.(5) Because the trained and experienced social workers available are employedin separate services with different statutory responsibilities, it is difficult toensure that their efforts are deployed in the most effective and economicalway.(6) Because there are so many separate services and agencies, many families in need of help do not know which one to ask for help. Often they do not ask at all, or they are bewildered by being referred from one service toanother.A new social work department9. The social work professions are working towards a situation in which theirprofessional organisation and training will take more account of these factors.Local authorities for their part have tried to take account of them by establishingarrangements for co-ordination, not only of their own services but also of certainvoluntary organisations. These arrangements are often not entirely satisfactory,and even when they work well they are costly in working time.10. In order to provide better services and to develop them economically itseems necessary that the local authority services designed to provide com-munity care and support, whether for children, the handicapped, the mentallyand physically ill or the aged, should be brought within a single organisation. As
it would be undesirable to separate the administration of support in the com-munity from that of residential care, this organisation should be responsiblealso for residential establishments which are intended to provide personal care,support and rehabilitation. The responsibilities of this organisation would therefore be wide, but would be homogeneous in that they would all be based onthe insights and skills of the profession of social work and be concerned withmeeting personal need. These responsibilities should not be subordinated to anyother function of local authorities. It is therefore proposed that they should becarried by a new Social Work Department of the local authority.11. The setting up of a social work department would not necessarily mean that all social workers in the department would have to undertake all kinds ofwork that its duties cover. As most present social workers have acquired their training and experience in one specialty or another, the use of their specialistskills would continue. Their employment in one department would, however,permit much greater flexibility of deployment than is now practicable andwould make continuity of care easier to arrange; it would make consultation and co-operation much easier; it would facilitate a desirable increase in move-ment of staff between social work in the community and social work based oninstitutions; and it would facilitate also the recruitment of certain social workers(e.g. psychiatric and medical social workers) who do not now enter localauthority employment in appreciable numbers but who would be very valuablein the development of the services.Co-operation between local authority departments12. The formation of a social work department of the local authority on thelines proposed would greatly reduce the present difficulties of co-ordination andco-operation between the separate social work services. It would provide a singledoor on which anyone might knock to ask for help with confidence of gettingit, and it would simplify the local authorities&apos; communication with the Ministryof Social Security and with the many voluntary organisations which do so muchof the exploratory work in social service. But the new department could not hope to provide from its own resources the means of solving all the social and personal problems of those who seek its aid, and the success of much of its work will depend on the degree to which it can gain the support and influence the work of many other public and voluntary services. For example, it will haveto co-operate closely with education authorities in assessment of children, andin the development of school welfare work. In supporting the ill, the handicappedand the aged the new department must clearly work closely with the health services. In trying to prevent family separations due to eviction the new depart-ment will need the co-operation and help of housing authorities and privatelandlords. Hardship due to cutting off of cooking and heating supplies can be prevented or reduced only if the help of the suppliers of gas and electricity isenlisted.13. All these points of contact will continue to require co-operation betweenthe new department and other agencies, mainly in the day-to-day work oftackling the immediate crises and problems of individuals and families. beyond this, however, is a less obvious but equally important need for co-operation atpolicy-making and management levels, in the improvement and promotion of measures which would help both to prevent the occurrence of these problems
and to enable communities and individuals more readily to surmount problems and resolve tensions by their own efforts. Such measures are practicable, butthey cannot in practice be planned and put into effect by the unaided efforts ofone department of the local authority.14. To take the community first, it seems clear that physical environmentaffects social development and behaviour. Large housing schemes built toprovide much-needed houses but offering little in the way of social, recreationalor entertainment facilities have thrown up many social problems. The trans-formation of town centres into business areas which have no residentpopulations has created others. Again, many families have to live in houses so small or so designed that their children have great difficulty in doing schoolhomework, in developing personal interests, in obtaining the privacy which isessential to their healthy development and even in escaping from the familytelevision. Physical planning and change involve social factors, which in thepast have not always been taken fully into account. This is not surprisingbecause, although the local authorities responsible for these changes have oftenemployed social workers for specific purposes, they have had no officer withgeneral responsibility in that field to advise them in a positive and constructiveway and at an early stage. The creation of a new social work department intouch with all the social problems and needs of the area will change this situation. Its chief officer and the knowledge and experience of his department should clearly be consulted on the social aspects of environmental changes. Soalso should his medical and educational colleagues, to a greater extent than hasalways been the case in the past. The social work, health and education depart-ments should be enabled to contribute to the planning of community projectsfrom the earliest stages, so that changes in environment may be designed with greater appreciation of the influence which these changes are likely to have onthe people and communities affected by them.The need for a positive approach15. A wider approach of this kind to community development would help toavoid the creation of social difficulties. Difficulties will nevertheless continue to occur. The social services will always be needed to help to deal with them, butit would clearly be better for the individual people concerned, and would reducethe demands for help, if the individual^ own capacity to deal with his difficulties,supported by his friends and neighbours, could be increased. Essentially this isa matter of promoting the full personal development of the individual, emotion-ally as well as physically and mentally, and is largely concerned with the ways in which children are brought up and educated. A great deal of effort is already being applied to this purpose. The health services are active in promoting thehealthy development of children, by a variety of means and particularly throughthe work of health visitors in advising and guiding mothers in bringing up their children. Schools are increasingly aware of the importance of ensuring thebalanced development of every child. Social workers who are called upon tohelp a family in any kind of difficulty are concerned to ensure that the develop-ment of the family&apos;s children is not endangered by the difficulty.16. If positive work of this kind could be extended and developed, thebenefits would be great. Individual people would be likely to become more effective, at work as well as in personal life, and community life could be richer
and healthier. It is not necessary to devise new public functions for the extensionof this kind of work, but there is scope for the public services mentioned above to work together in ways which so far have been too little explored. For example,general practitioners, health visitors and social workers know the families inwhich children&apos;s development is unsatisfactory or inadequate and whosechildren would benefit from attendance at nursery schools, play groups andother facilities designed to promote the development of young children, but this knowledge can be really fruitful only if it is brought purposefully to bear on community planning.17. There are many similar ways in which valuable preventive work could beextended if the interests of the education, health and social work services were seen in this way not only as complementary but also as interdependent, in policy as well as in practice, and if they can combine their knowledge and effortsfor the purpose.
II. The Local Authority Social Work Department18. The conclusion that there should be a social work department of the localauthority to provide a range of social services, including those which theKilbrandon Committee recommended for children, requires a series of decisions about the existing services which should be merged in it. This part of the paperconsiders each of the main services concerned, the related responsibilities whichthe new department should have and the local authority area on which it shouldbe based.Child care19. The Kilbrandon Committee recommended that the child care service should be amalgamated with other services for children. They thought that the resulting new service could be the &quot;centre and core&quot; of a wider service in thefuture which might cater &quot;for the needs of adults of all ages as well as those of thechildren in the family&quot;. It is just such a wider service which is now proposed, and child care seems to be an appropriate function for it to have. The present duties and powers of the local authority in regard to deprived children, including theduties of providing advice, guidance and assistance to children and parents whoseek it, will therefore become the responsibility of the social work department.This department will undertake also the supervision and care of children whoare subject to decisions of the children&apos;s panel which is to be set up; these functions are discussed in more detail later in this paper.School attendance and welfare20. Attendance officers are employed by education authorities in pursuingtheir duty to ensure that children attend school regularly, and some authoritiesemploy welfare officers to help ensure the welfare of school children. these officers are in varying degrees involved in social work with the children&apos;s families.They provide an invaluable source of early warning of children&apos;s and familyproblems, partly because bad attendance at school often indicates suchproblems. Education authorities have a statutory responsibility to seethat children attend school, and any staff employed to investigate absencesfrom school would require to be on thier books. The Government think,however, that responsibility for providing school welfare services shouldbe assigned to the new department and that existing education authority staff employed specifically on welfare duties should be brought into it. By continuing to work in the closest association with teachers they could form an effectivelink between the schools and the social services generally.The assessment of children&apos;s needs21. The care or treatment offered to any child, and the decisions of thechildren&apos;s panel must be based on professional assessment of the needs of the child. This assessment involves careful investigation and consideration of the
problems of each child and his family, and recommendation of the measureslikely to be most successful in resolving these problems. For some children this task may need only the attention of a social worker who can discuss the situation with the family, and consult the child&apos;s teacher, school doctor and others as maybe appropriate. It will often be necessary, however, to bring in one or more of a wide range of other professional people such as educational psychologists,general practitioners, health visitors, child psychiatrists and paediatricians, andthere must be effective arrangements for ready access to all these different skills.22. Assessment will usually be done by means of visits by social workers andothers to the child in his own home and, when necessary, by visits by the childand his parents to an appropriate assessment centre or clinic. For some children,however, this will not be practicable or desirable, for example because of their home conditions or their unruly behaviour. In such circumstances the child will,if his parents agree, be removed from home for assessment. A young childmight be cared for in a suitable children&apos;s home or hospital while attending aclinic as necessary. For older and very disturbed children residential assessmentcentres or clinics will be provided for the purpose. All the facilities for assessmentshould be available for any child who might derive benefit from them.23. Arrangements for assessment of the special needs of children in regard to education are already made by education authorities as part of the childguidance service. This work often involves children&apos;s families, and it needsaccess to the same range of medical, educational and social workers as is mentioned above. Assessment for the purposes of the education authority andof the social work department will, therefore, have a good deal of common ground, and in principle there is a case for combining the work into a singleassessment service. In practice, the child guidance service is concerned withother educational duties, for example remedial teaching, in addition to assess-ment, and the social work department will similarly have a range of other duties. The creation of a single assessment service seems for this reason to be impracticable in the near future. It would, however, be possible to secure mostof the practical benefits of a single service if the educational psychologistsresponsible for assessment for educational purposes and the social workersresponsible for assessment for the new department could work in the sameclinics or centres. They could then consult each other easily and quickly and could have shared arrangements for consulting all the other specialists.24. It is therefore proposed that the two services should co-operate by basingtheir assessment work in the same premises. It is envisaged that assessmentclinics for children living in their own homes or children&apos;s homes will, where appropriate, be formed in child guidance clinics, in which the staff of the social work department will join those of the child guidance service, and that residen-tial assessment centres will be formed from the present remand homes, whereeducational psychologists will work alongside social workers. Clinics and residential centres will need to be extended and improved in those areas whereprovision of one kind or the other is still inadequate.25. Arrangements along these lines would promote the continuing develop-ment of assessment work to the benefit both of the child guidance services, whosometimes find difficulty at present in securing the social work help they need,and of the social work departments, who will need to draw upon the skills of educational psychologists and the information about individual children whichis available in the schools.
School health26. The Kilbrandon Committee recommended that the school health service,which is a function of the education authority, should be incorporated in thenew department which they envisaged. It is clear that this service as one of the health services has an important role in promoting the healthy development ofchildren, including the work of assessment and of prevention and early treat-ment of disturbance, and that it should work in close conjunction not only withthe education authority child guidance service but also with the new social workdepartment. But as its staff consists almost entirely of doctors, dentists and nurses, and as its work is not primarily social work, it could not appropriately be part of a social work department. It is therefore proposed that the schoolhealth service should continue on its present basis.Probation27. It is an essential element of the recommendations of the KilbrandonReport that the future equivalent of probation supervision of children should beprovided within the new local authority department. This, as the Committeerealized, necessitates change for the probation service and for its administrationas they exist at present. Such change immediately raises the question of thefuture responsibility for the probation serviced present functions in relation to persons of sixteen years of age and over. The possible choices are to place theresponsibility for these functions also on the local authority, thus avoiding anydivision of the present service into two, or to set up a new service to carry out themore limited functions.28. The Morison Committee on the Probation Service* described the pro-nation  service as &quot;essentially a social service of the courts&quot; and as a &quot;courtservice&quot;; and criticised its system of administration in Scotland as inadequatelyreflecting this. This would point to the establishment for those over sixteen of anew service separate from the local authority social work department. (Onefresh consideration since the Committee reported has been the assumption bythe probation service of a function not closely related to the courts, the after-care of offenders released from penal institutions. The Governmenfs intention that all after-care supervision should be provided by the local service which isalso responsible for probation supervision has already been announced, andafter-care would therefore grow to form a substantial part of the duties of anew service concerned with those over sixteen.) On the other hand, the mainduty of the probation officer personal social work with the offender and his family in the community is basically similar to that of other social workers.His function of assessment, though for the assistance of the court, is part of thesocial worker&apos;s essential skills. The arguments for the carrying out of thefunctions of the present probation service by the social work department are,therefore, the same as those in respect of other services which it is proposed tobring into the department the avoidance of a multiplicity of services carryingout essentially similar work in the same community or even in the same family.29. The Governmenfs conclusion is that, on balance, it would be better if allthe functions of the probation service in Scotland were undertaken by the localauthority social work department. In reaching this view, they have had particular regard to the consideration that a separate service for the adult offender would* Report of the Departmental Committee on the Probation Service (Cmnd. 1650).
be a small service somewhat apart from the mainstream of social work, and this might well have adverse effects on career prospects, on the recruitment of staffof the calibre required and in the development of new social work skills by theservice. In view, however, of the importance to the courts of the services provided to them by the present probation service, it would be necessary toestablish machinery to enable the courts to be associated with the arrangementsfor the provision of these services by the social work department.Community care and after-care of the ill and welfare of the handicapped30. Local authorities are empowered by the National Health Service (Scot-land) Act 1947 and the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1960 to provide care andafter-care for people suffering from illness or mental deficiency. The national assistance Act 1948 empowers local authorities to promote the welfare of peoplesuffering from any of a wide range of handicaps. The services provided underthese powers include the provision by welfare departments of advice, guidance and support to patients and their families. The work involved in this is closelyakin to that expected of the new social work department, and in practice manyof the families who will need the help of that department include among their difficulties an illness or handicap of some kind or degree. It is therefore pro-posed that these services of social support in the care and after-care of the ill,mentally disordered and handicapped should be undertaken by the new department.31. Clinical responsibility for all patients, whatever their illness, would ofcourse, continue to rest with the general medical practitioner who would beable and encouraged to call upon the help of the social work department.Liaison would need to be maintained also between the new department and the health services administered by the medical officer of health and, where theyhave been involved, services based on hospitals, health centres, etc.Welfare of old people32. Supporting services for old people are already of great importance, andtheir importance will grow with the increasing proportion of old people in thepopulation. It is desirable that whenever possible old people should remain inthe community rather than go into residential care, and if they are to do so a wide range of help from public and voluntary services is needed. Suitablehouses, opportunities for occupation and recreation, meals on wheels, homehelp and other facilities are all necessary in addition to the health services.Those concerned have not only to recognise the need of an old person for helpbut also to identify, arrange and keep under review the kinds of help he needs.33. The health services as a whole will continue to be in contact with manyold people. In particular, the general practitioner and the health visitor are well placed to observe their needs for help and in many circumstances to meet them.There are, however, forms of help and support which another agency couldmore readily arrange if asked to do so. The new social work department wouldbe able to provide a service of this kind which would be entirely consistent withits support of other groups of people and would also be available to be called in by old people themselves, by neighbours and relatives. It is therefore proposedthat the new department should be responsible for the provision of support and
assistance to old people, including the provision of old people&apos;s homes and daycentres. The responsibilities of medical practitioners would not be affected inany way.Domestic help34. The powers of the local authority to provide domestic or home help interms of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947 are already wide. Theservice is increasing in scope, but its potential for assistance in teaching elemen-tary home management has not been adequately explored. It should increasinglybe brought into play in the rehabilitation of families with multiple problems.The residential training in mothercraft and home management which is givento mothers could be more effective if it were followed up by suitable home helpson the mother&apos;s return to her own home. Again, when a mother has to go intohospital for treatment it is often better for her children, as well as cheaper, if thelocal authority provides a home help to look after them, rather than receivesthem into care, and this practice should be extended.35. At present, the home help service is often administered by welfaredepartments, or by welfare officers in health and welfare departments. more positive use of home helps in the ways suggested will show more clearly thegeneral supporting nature of the work, and the training of home helps for asupportive role lies within the field of social work. It is proposed, therefore,that in future the provision and management of home helps should be under-taken by the social work department.36. The provision of home helps when a medical practitioner thought itnecessary in case of illness would be the responsibility of the social workdepartment. Home help would be only one of the range of supporting services which the department would make available to doctors in this way.Homeless families37. Temporary accommodation has to be provided for families renderedhomeless by unforeseen circumstances such as fire and flood. For families whobecome homeless for other reasons for example, following eviction for non-payment of rent or from a tied house on loss of employment temporary accommodation by itself is inadequate; it has to be allied to a social rehabilitation-tation service. It is therefore proposed that the provision and management of temporary accommodation should rest with the social work department,which could provide the necessary support and mobilise other social services as appropriate.iStaffing of the new department38. It is proposed that the social work department will be headed by a director of Social Work. The importance of this post, the variety of professionalskills and experience that may be suitable, and the range of new duties makea new procedure for selection desirable. It is proposed that applicationsfor appointment to the post will be considered in the first instance by an advisorycommittee composed partly of members of the local authority and partly ofpersons drawn from a list of independent referees appointed by theSecretary of State, and the committee will advise the local authority on which, of
fthe applicants have the qualifications and experience necessary for the post.The local authority will make their selection from the candidates regarded asqualified.39. The Director will be generally responsible for all the work of his depart-ment. He will have specific responsibility for children in the care of the localauthority, for advising the children&apos;s panel and for ensuring, on behalf of thelocal authority, that children under the jurisdiction of the panel are dealt withaccording to the panePs decisions.40. The number of other staff required by the new department will be amatter for the local authority to decide. There is increasing scope for the use ofpart-time staff and of the services of voluntary workers under the supervision of professional staff, and it is hoped that local authorities will arrange to takeadvantage of these opportunities.41. The statutory posts of children&apos;s officer and probation officer will be abolished.Staff training42. This paper referred earlier to the shortage of staff, particularly of trainedstaff, in the local authority social services in Scotland. The Government believethat the form of reorganisation envisaged will help local authorities to providewith the staff who are available a better service than they are at present able togive, and to plan more accurately their staffing requirements for the future. Tomeet future requirements the supply of trained staff needs to be increased.Suitable in-service training schemes are needed for staff in post who have noprofessional qualifications, and refresher courses for all staff.43. Already in the last few years there has been a worthwhile expansion of social work training facilities in Scotland. Before 1960 the only courses leading to professional qualifications in social work provided for small numbers of medical and psychiatric social workers, although three of the four universitiesprovided basic courses in social science. In 1966 three universities are providingbasic and professional courses for a wider range and for greater numbers of social work students. Elsewhere, three two-year courses leading to professional qualifications in social work are available, a separate qualifying course is available for probation officers, and the training capacity for residential childcare workers has been increased. Additional courses will be started later in 1966and refresher courses have been expanded. A great deal remains to be done,and further expansion along these lines is already planned.44. Changes will be needed, too, in the range and content of training courses.With the formation of social work departments which will be bigger and have agreater variety of responsibilities than existing departments, many social workers will be more directly concerned in administration than they are atpresent, and courses should prepare them for this. Social workers are increas-ingly taking the view and this is being reflected in training arrangements that social work is a single profession within which specialties should be sub-ordinate to the profession as a whole, in much the same way as medical specialtiesare subordinate to the profession of medicine. The knowledge and expertise ofthe new department will be increasingly invoked in an advisory role in relationto the work of other departments of the local authority, and social workers willhave to be trained to play this role. Greater use could be made of the services of
3Pvoluntary workers, and training courses should prepare social workers to usevoluntary effort more effectively. Again, it will be necessary to provide training courses at a variety of different levels, whether at the initial stage of training or at the in-service and refresher course stages.45. Training cannot of course be separated from recruitment. In recent years a large proportion of the students undertaking Scottish courses in social workhave come from outside Scotland, and after qualifying have left Scotland towork elsewhere. The reasons for this are complex and owe at least something to the lack of a well-established tradition of social work as a professionalcareer in local authorities in Scotland. The Government intend to do everythingthey can to ensure that young people in Scotland are made aware of the oppor-tunities which exist in this field, but the principal inducement to young Scots totake up a career in social work may well prove to be the creation and develop-ment of comprehensive departments with their greater scope for the talents ofeach member of staff. The attractiveness of the career which such departments will offer should also stimulate recruitment.Residential accommodation46. It is increasingly recognised that for most people in social or emotionaldifficulty the best form of help, whatever their age and particular problem, issupport in their own. homes if that is practicable. For some, however, residentialcare on a short-term or long-term basis will continue to be necessary, and suitable establishments must be provided. There is scope for much improvementin this provision. More accommodation is needed over the whole range of establishments, from homes for old people to facilities for the care of babiesand young children. More variety of types of establishment is also needed; forexample, a child is sometimes placed in a home or school because nothing betteris available, although all concerned recognise that the regime may not be entirelyfitted to his particular needs. There is too little flexibility of use between thevarious categories of establishment. There is considerable difficulty in recruiting and retaining sufficient staff of the necessary quality, and this will remain a problem. An enquiry into the staffing of residential homes and institutions isnow being made on behalf of the National Council of Social Service by acommittee under the chairmanship of Lady Williams, and is likely to showsome of the ways in which it could be solved. It would not be practicable todeal here in detail with the amount and kinds of residential provision whichare required. Improvements are being made, and with growing experience and increasing research and experiment new kinds of home, hostel, school and re-habilitation centre will be evolved. The different forms of provision should befitted to the needs of the users and not the other way round and, within the limits of administrative possibility, unnecessary or out-dated barriers between one form of provision and another should be taken down.47. So far as accommodation for adults is concerned the barriers are mainlythose of tradition, and they can be reduced by developing practice. Certainformal changes affecting residential establishments for children will be necessary.It is proposed to abolish existing statutory distinctions between certain types ofsuch establishment and to have a continuous and varied range of establishmentsavailable for children who need residential care or training. Approved schoolswhich will no longer be known by this generic name, will form part of this range.
Those remand homes which are suitable will become assessment centres, andtheir principal function will be to make available a full range of assessmentfacilities for all children sent to them. They will provide residential accommoda-tion for the minority of children who cannot be assessed while living in their ownhomes and who cannot satisfactorily be accommodated for this purpose in achildren&apos;s home or hospital.Administrative areas48. Most of the social work and welfare services which it is proposed to combine into a new department are functions of counties and large burghs, as are the local authority health services. This review has not, of course, been concerned with any change in local authority areas, but it has been necessary toconsider whether the new department should be formed in counties and large burghs or, like education authorities, in counties (including counties of cities).Several factors have to be taken into account.49. Experience has shown that many of the existing social work units of localgovernment are too small to employ more than a few social workers. Even ifdepartments which are now separate were amalgamated to form a social workdepartment in each area, that department would, in a great many areas, consistof only a handful of social workers. It is true that some small units have beenable to do very good work, but they suffer from some serious disadvantages.Small units do not provide satisfactory career opportunities for keen and progressive staff. They can offer few opportunities for the professional consul-tation which is valued highly by social workers. With so few staff, they find it very difficult to release staff for training and to offer supervised practical training to students. In a small staff, the range of experience is usually limited, and therecan be little flexibility in dealing with particular types of problem. Partly forthese reasons, very small departments do not easily attract well-qualified staff.This weakness and their limited financial resources aggravate their difficulties.50. It could be argued that large departments tend to be cumbersome andmight become too bureaucratic and impersonal to be appropriate for social work. These faults can, however, be avoided by suitable organisation of thedepartments staff and work. It is proposed, for example, that in large areas thenew department should work through area offices easily accessible to the com-munity and staffed by trained workers able and empowered to provide an effective social service at local level.51. A further factor is that, as explained earlier in this paper, the new depart-ment will have to co-operate closely with education authorities, particularly inthe assessment of children. It will have to work also with the health services andother bodies. The local authority health services are based on large burghs aswell as counties, but hospital authorities, like education authorities and certain other relevant bodies, are based on larger areas, and it would be easier for thenew department to work with these if it were also based on larger rather thansmaller areas.52. The immediate practical problem in this review is how best to fit the new department into the existing local authority structure. The Government thinkthat on balance it would be best to place responsibility for the new department on counties (including counties of cities), and to empower and encourage the
counties with the smallest populations to join with other authorities to&quot; form 286joint departments serving their combined populations.Costs and grant arrangements53. The existing departments and services which will be amalgamated toform the new social work department of the local authority would require to be expanded in the next few years whether they were reorganised or not. Withinthe limits of national resources, the rate of their expansion will depend mainlyupon the availability of suitable staff. In the short term, reorganisation will not of itself lead to appreciably increased costs. The main increases in cost will be dueto the appointment of Directors of Social Work and any consequential re-grading of other posts. These increases will be balanced by the greater economy which will follow the avoidance of overlapping services and more rationaldeployment of staff.54. Most of the existing services which will be undertaken by the new depart-ment are at present provided under general grant arrangements. It is proposedthat the costs of the new social work department will be met by the local authority under the new arrangements for rate support grant.Central advisory service55. The fact that the developing social services have no long tradition of professional work in local authorities makes it very important that there shouldbe available to local authorities, in setting up the new social work departments,the help and guidance of a professional advisory service. The government intend to provide this service. It will supersede and absorb the present inspec-torates for approved schools, child care and probation and the Scottish Homeand Health Department^ welfare officers. It will be composed of well-qualifiedpeople with collective experience in several branches of social work and headed by an officer of senior status. To ensure that local authorities may have the help and advice of this service in designing their new departments it will be set upwell in advance of the date when new legislation will come into operation.
III. Social Work with Children56. This part of the paper describes the roles in relation to children of thenew social work department and of the new children&apos;s panel. Briefly, the social work department will provide a range of services which children and their families can be offered, or may ask for, on an entirely voluntary basis. Wherevoluntary co-operation is not forthcoming or cannot be expected, compulsory powers will be necessary. These will be in the hands of the children&apos;s panel,which will work on the lines recommended by the Kilbrandon Committee.Paragraphs 63-81 of this paper describe in a general way how the panel willconduct its business. The paper does not deal with the many important detailsof the panel&apos;s powers and procedures, but in preparing legislation the Govern-ment will consider the many observations already submitted to them on thesematters and any others received at later stages.The role of the social work department57. The proposal to merge the children&apos;s department into a new localauthority department with much wider responsibilities will be a departure from the recommendations of the Committee on Homeless Children (the clyde Committee) in 1946 that deprived children should be the responsibilityof a separate local authority department. But there have been many develop-ments in social work since then, and some of the most important of these havestemmed from the work done and experience gained by the children&apos;s depart-ments set up then. At that time, the care of deprived children was seen asmainly concerned with the provision of substitute homes. In the last fifteen years increasing emphasis has been placed on efforts to prevent deprivationby securing adequate care for the child in his own home whenever that is practicable. This change of emphasis has involved child care workers to an increasing extent in work with the parents, relatives and communities to whichthe children belong, and the nature of this work has developed into the pro-vision of guidance and support for a wide range of people who are in emotionalor social difficulty. Largely from this experience has grown the recognition thatthis kind of support and guidance is of the essence of social work, for deprived children as for other members of the community. Social workers increasinglyappreciate that in any situation in which the welfare of children is at risk thechildren&apos;s welfare must be safeguarded in the event of any clash of interests,and that policy decisions must take account of this.58. For these reasons, there should be no difficulty in ensuring that the care of deprived children does not suffer from the widening of the scope of theorganisation which will be responsible for it. The following paragraphs discussthe ways in which the social work department will develop the support and guidance available to children and their families.59. The existing duties and powers of the local authority in relation to children who are deprived of an ordinary upbringing will be continued, theonly change in practice being that the functions of the local authority will be discharged through the social work department instead of through the children&apos;department.
60. For children who have got, or are likely to get, into social difficulty ofany kind the really important thing is that parents and guardians should beable to get help locally, quickly and easily. In future, families and their childrenwill be able to look to the new social work department for rapid and effectiveassistance in time of trouble. The existing powers of local authorities to advise,guide and assist children and their families are very wide, and in future all these powers will be discharged by the local authority through the new department,whose work for children will be both preventive and remedial, informal and formal.61. How will the needs of a child in difficulty be met under the new arrange-ments ? There will be many ways, and the one chosen will depend on thecircumstances. Perhaps an eleven-year-old boy regularly stays away from homeuntil midnight and his anxious parents turn to the new department for help;or a health visitor finds evidence that a child is being neglected in circumstanceswith which she herself cannot deal; or a school is concerned about a child&apos;snon-attendance or obvious lack of proper parental care. In all these circum-stances, as well as in cases where one of the department^ own staff finds thefirst evidence of trouble, the new department will have a responsibility to help.A social worker from its staff will call on the parents and child. It may be thatall that is needed in some cases is a simple piece of advice; in other cases the parents may welcome continuing help and advice, or even supervision of the child, on a voluntary basis. In some cases, as at present, it may be helpful forsome or all of the children in the family to be received into the local authority&apos;scare for a time. Sometimes it will be necessary to arrange for specialist assessment,and the new department will be able to arrange this. All these actions will ofcourse depend upon entirely voluntary co-operation and acceptance by the parents or guardian of the local authority&apos;s help.62. Thus in many cases in which shortcomings in a child&apos;s upbringingbecome apparent, the matter will be dealt with -by the new department on a voluntary basis with the families concerned. Sometimes, however, informalwork of this kind will turn out to be unsuccessful, or it will be evident from thefirst investigation that voluntary help would not be enough because, forexample, the child and his family are not willing to co-operate, or deny the needfor any intervention, or because, despite their intention to co-operate, the familyare too infirm of purpose to do so effectively. It is to deal with children in circumstances such as these that children&apos;s panels are to be set up.The role of the children&apos;s panel63. A children&apos;s panel will be set up in the area of each county and city onthe lines recommended by the Kilbrandon Committee, that is, as a body of laypeople which will be empowered to order such measures of treatment andtraining as seem to it to be required by a child brought before it. Subject to theCrown&apos;s right to prosecute (which will be invoked only in exceptional cases)a child may be brought before the panel if he has not reached 16 years of age and if there is a prima facie case that the child needs some form of care or controlbecause he has committed an offence, or has behaved in other specified ways which are seriously anti-social, or is unduly exposed to danger to his physical,mental or moral development.64. As the Kilbrandon Committee recommended, the panel will need anofficial to decide whether or not the circumstances of each child found to be in
trouble or difficulty should be brought before the panel, and also to organiseits work, to present cases to it, to arrange hearings and to ensure that thepanePs decisions are carried out and reviewed at specified intervals. This officialwill be known as the Reporter.65. The Reporter will receive notices from the police and other sources aboutchildren who may need to be brought before the panel. On receiving such a notice, the Reporter will require the Director of Social Work to give him full information about the family and social background of the child concerned. Inmany cases the Director is likely to recommend that the most appropriate action would be voluntary supervision by one of the Directors staff and, unless there is a compelling reason for bringing the child before the panel, the Reporterwill agree to this. In such cases the child will not be brought before the panel.66. When, having considered the information given to him by the Director of social Work and any other advisers who have been consulted, the Reporterdecides to bring a child before the panel, he will write to the child and hisparents requiring them to attend a hearing of the panel, setting out the reasonsfor this requirement and informing them of their right to dispute these reasonsbefore the court. At the hearing, the Reporter will state the reasons for whichthe child has been brought before the panel, and the child and his parents willbe asked if they accept his statement as true. If they do, the fact will be recorded and the panel will go on to consider the background reports on the child, theadvice of the social work department and of any specialists consulted. They will discuss the whole circumstances with the child and his parents, and in the lightof that discussion will reach a decision on the treatment or training which the child should have. The chairman will inform the child and his parents of thepanePs decision. In most cases the child and his family will have been able todiscuss possibilities of treatment with a social worker before the hearing, and arelikely to accept the panePs decision. If they accept the decision, the chairmanwill record the fact and the decision will become binding on the child and hisparents until it is changed or rescinded by the panel. The panel will be requiredto review the decision at intervals of not more than twelve months, but may alterit at any time if the child&apos;s circumstances require a change. The panel will havepower to discharge a child from its jurisdiction at any time when that seems tothe panel to be in the child&apos;s best interest, and in any event the child may not remain under the panePs jurisdiction after his 18th birthday.67. When the child or his parents dispute the reasons for which the childhas been brought before the panel, the hearing will be immediately adjourned.Unless it decides to proceed no further, the panel will refer the matter to thecourt for a determination of the facts. If the court determines that the case for bringing the child before the panel has not been substantiated, the matter willend there. If the court finds the case substantiated, the panel will proceed with it at a fresh hearing.68. It will be open to the child or his parents to appeal to the court against any decision which the panel may take about the child at the first or any sub-sequent hearing, and it will be for the court to decide on appeal whether thedecision is in the interests of the child or whether it amounts to unjustifiedinterference between parent and child or unwarranted infringement of individualliberty.69. Whenever the panel decides to assume jurisdiction over a child it will bethe responsibility of the local authority, through the Director of the social work
department, to ensure that the decision of the panel is effectively implemented.In most cases, supervision of the child in his own home will be carried out by anofficer of the department, but suitable people who are not members of thedepartments staff may be asked to undertake this task. Similarly, if a child is removed from his home to a children&apos;s home or some other residential establish-ment, it will be the Directors responsibility to ensure that the child and his family are visited regularly, prepared as well as possible for the return of the child to his family, and visited and advised after the child returns home.70. An essential feature of the new system is that parents should be encouraged,and if necessary obliged, to involve themselves personally in consultation withthe panel and in the training of their children following the panePs decision.In arranging for initial hearings and reviews the Reporter will try to ensure asfar as possible that it is practicable for both parents to attend. If they then fail to do so without an excuse which seems to the panel reasonable the panel willbe able to ask the court to make an order citing them to appear with their childbefore the panel The panel will be able to seek the backing of an order by thecourt in other circumstances also; for example where parents refuse to co-operate by providing background information about a child without which the panel cannot proceed. It is envisaged that in most areas it will be practicable toadopt the Kilbrandon Committee&apos;s suggestion that hearings should be held inthe evenings and on Saturdays, in order to make it easier for parents to attend.71. The range of residential establishments to which the panel will havepower to send children will include children&apos;s homes and hostels and the present approved schools, which will no longer be a separate category of establishmentbut will become an integral part of a range of establishments providing a variety of regimes and special treatments. The panel will be able to decide the particular establishment or kind of establishment to which a child should besent. It will be the duty of the local authority, through the Director, to ensurethat the child is adequately and suitably cared for in accordance with thatdecision.72. The panel will not have power to require that a child should attend aspecial school. This will continue to rest upon the child&apos;s ascertainment by theeducation authority as in need of special education. Because of the very close association which is proposed between the assessment arrangements for thepurposes of the panel and of the education authority, it is expected that a childbrought to notice through the paneFs machinery but found on assessment to need special education will be so ascertained by the education authority.73. After reaching an initial decision on the treatment or training of anychild, the panel will be able to review that decision at any time. Such formalreviews by the panel will be made for each child at intervals of not more than twelve months. The parent of any child under the jurisdiction of the panel willbe entitled to require the panel at any time to review the child&apos;s case, providedthat more than three months have elapsed since the last review. Where a child is placed, following a decision of the panel, in a residential establishment theperson in charge of the establishment will at intervals of not more than threemonths report to the Director of Social Work on the child&apos;s progress.. 74. The panel will not have authority to make orders under the MentalHealth (Scotland) Act 1960. This power will remain with the sheriff.75. Detention of children as a punishment will be abolished.
Members of the panel76. The new system of children&apos;s panels will work successfully only if suitablemembers of the community are willing and able to serve on the panels inadequate numbers. They must have knowledge and experience in dealing with children and should be drawn from a wide variety of occupation, neighbourhood,age group and income group. It is expected that many teachers, ministers,leaders of youth organisations, etc. will wish to take part, as well as membersof local authorities and their staffs, but it is hoped also that the new system will attract suitable people whose occupations or circumstances have hithertoprevented them from taking a formal part in helping and advising young people.For example, many housewives have considerable experience, knowledge and understanding of young people, and others such as those engaged in the branchesof entertainment and commerce which cater specially for young people could give valuable assistance in this work although they might not previously have thought of themselves as candidates for public service. There will be as fewrestrictions as possible on eligibility for panel membership. It is inappropriate,however, that people who might be professionally concerned in advising panelsor in helping to implement their decisions should be members.77. Suitable members can be attracted by a number of means. Bodies suchas professional associations, trades unions, churches, voluntary organisations,etc., will be asked to invite their members to offer to help in this important work.In addition, individual applications will be invited through the press and othermedia. The Kilbrandon Committee suggested that the selection and appoint-ment of panel members should be carried out by the Sheriff. This is one possiblearrangement, but the Government wish to give further consideration to themethod of appointment.78. On the assumption that the panels&apos; volume of business will in the first fewyears be comparable with that handled by juvenile courts at present, that each member would be available for about three hours per week throughout the year,and that each hearing would occupy an average time of forty minutes, and taking account of reviews, it is estimated that Glasgow may need about 300members, Edinburgh about 60 and Dundee about 25. These estimates give a guide to probable numbers required in other areas. The Government are con-confident that on this basis sufficient people interested in the problems of children in difficulties can be found to staff the panels with suitable members.79. From the list of panel members an adequate number of chairmen will beappointed to preside at hearings. Chairmen will require a good deal of experience and after the first few years it will be usual for chairmen to have already servedat least one full term as an ordinary member. Each hearing will be conducted bya chairman and two members, at least one member of each sex being present.80. It is unnecessary for members of panels to be expert social workers. Theexpertise necessary in their work will be supplied by the local authority&apos;s social work department. Members will, however, need a good knowledge of treatmentmethods and of the facilities available for applying them, and they will have tobecome practised in the best methods of bringing the child and his parent intothe process by which a decision is reached and into active participation in thattreatment. Many suitable people will lack some of this knowledge and experience.Panel members will therefore require a certain amount of training, and it isproposed that at the outset this training will be arranged for them by the localauthority.
* 81. Hearings will be held in locations selected to ensure that children Indparents will not have to travel unreasonable distances. The area to be served,by any one location will depend upon the volume of work, the type of area andthe availability of members. The aim will be that decisions on how to deal witha particular child should be taken by members who have personal knowledgeof the community to which the child belongs. There may be objections to localpeople who are panel members having access to intimate information aboutfamilies in their neighbourhood, but the proceedings at hearings will be strictly confidential and the objections will be balanced both by the understanding which knowledge of the neighbourhood makes possible and by the building upby this means of a sense of local responsibility for the more unfortunate oranti-social members of the local community. Hearings will be held in premisesentirely dissociated from criminal courts and police stations. In most areas itwill be possible to find suitable premises in public halls, schools and otherexisting buildings.Costs of the children&apos;s panel82. The costs of the new system of children&apos;s panels cannot be accuratelyestimated at this stage. They will consist mainly of the salaries of Reportersand their staffs, accommodation, and travelling, etc., expenses of panel members,and the total seems unlikely to exceed about  500,000 a year. Against this,there will be savings due to the abolition of the existing juvenile courts, and thereduction of demand on the time of sheriff courts will enable them to reducedelays in hearing cases.83. It is proposed that the costs of the children&apos;s panel will be met by thelocal authority under the new arrangements for rate support grant.
Conclusion84. The proposals presented in this paper for the formation of a social workdepartment of the local authority and the setting up of children&apos;s panels will, inthe Government^ view, set the stage for a radical improvement in the scope and quality of the help which these services are able to give to the community,even with the staff now available. This initial improvement is in itself likely to attract additional professional staff to man the social work service, and further improvement will follow. As the new organisation develops, planned experimentwith new forms of service and systematic evaluation of the results can beexpected to show the directions in which further progress should lie.85. It is important to recognise, however, that the new organisation, howeverwell it may be conceived and designed, can do no more than set the stage. its success will depend on the extent to which all the professional workers con-cerned can co-operate with each other and can enlist the whole resources of thecommunity. The new organisation will realise its potential only as that co-opera-tion and community action extend and become fully effective.Printed in Scotland by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office Press, Edinburgh.Wt. 70952 K00 7/66 (3469)
