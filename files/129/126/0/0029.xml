P &apos;7C(66) 129 COPY.NO.CABINETAGRICULTURE AND IMPORT SAVINGSMemorandum by the Minister without PortfolioOn 10th August last the Cabinet (CC(66) 43rd Conclusions,Minute 3) asked us &quot;to consider whether greater savings of imports ofagricultural commodities could be achieved without serious damage toour international trading relationships, commitments and policies&quot;.I accordingly asked the Agriculture Ministers to prepare a Report forthe Committee on Agricultural Policy.    The Committee considered this Report on Monday, 12th September and I now invite my colleagues to endorse the Committee&apos;s conclusions, subject to a difference of view which it has not been possible to resolve, on credit for agriculture.2.      The substance of the Report by the Agricultural Ministers wasthat it would not be advisable to raise production targets for domesticagriculture beyond those agreed only last year as an integral part ofour present economic and agricultural policy.      The danger theMinisters foresee is that unless several obstacles to rising production are urgently removed, existing objectives are themselves in some danger of not being realised,3.      On the broad proposition to achieve greater savings of importsthe Ministers point out that the Governments present productionobjectives for agriculture were agreed only last year, after careful andthorough interdepartmental consideration, as an integral part of theNational Plan.    These took fully into account all relevant factors forthe period to 1970 - the future level of demand for food, the capacityof the industry, and of our overseas suppliers to provide it, theresources needed in both real and financial terms for various levels ofproduction and import, the consequences these levels would have forour international trading relationship commitments and policies.4.      The Agriculture Ministers argued that nothing has happened sincethe announcement of the National Flan to call in question either thecorrectness of its production objectives for agriculture, the capacityof the industry (given the necessary resources) to fulfil them, or the aquiescence of our overseas suppliers in the agricultural provisionsof the &quot;Plan, and my Committee unanimously endorse the conclusionthat the difficulties in the way of raising the production objectives for agriculture only a few months after they had been carefully formulatedas part of the National Plan are too formidable to overcome in the nearfuture.-I-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
-2-5.     But the Agriculture Ministers go on to suggest that the achievement of part of the agricultural Plan is being prejudiced by are currence of lack of confidence in the industry.    The rate of expansion slowed down considerably in 1965-66, due in part to bad weather and in part to a tough Price Review in 1965.    It was theirhope that this lack of confidence would be assuaged by the morefavourable Price Review of 1966.     But two of the elements of thesettlement of that Review, though agreed in general terms (andincorporated in the Review White Paper, Cmnd 2933), were left for more detailed discussion and interpretation after the Review.    these discussions had not been concluded when the July measures to take some of the pressure out of the economy were formulated, and farmersnow claim that the new restrictions on credit are operating in a wayinconsistent with their import-saving role.    There is also a particular problem in regard to pigs, where the 1965 measures to restrainexcessive production have worked too severely.6.      The Agriculture Ministers, therefore, advanced four proposalsfor immediate decision and announcement, designed to restore confidence in the industry and so remove some of the risks of failure to fulfil existing production objectives.    The Agricultural PolicyCommittee considered these four proposals, and reached agreement on three of them as recorded in the immediately following paragraphs.On the fourth point, concerning the effect of the credit squeeze on agriculture, it has not been possible to reach agreement, and this issue is now submitted to Cabinet for decision.7.      The Agriculture ministers first proposition on production wasthat the Government should announce at once that the middle band of the guaranteed price schedule for pigs would be increased at the 1967 annual review from 12. 4-13. 2 million to 12. 8-13, 6 million, which would enablefarmers to achieve the desired increases in production without sufferinga price penalty under the flexible guarantee arrangements.    my committee saw no difficulty in accepting this recommendation; therehas been a decline in the pig breeding herd of over 10 per cent, andmarketings have declined from the excessively high figure of13. 8 million in 1965-66 to a current annual rate of 12. 4 million.    We arenot filling our quota under the Bacon Market Sharing Agreement with denmark and other countries and there is a shortage of pigmeat inEurope generally.    My Committee therefore endorse the agriculture ministers&apos; recommendation to announce that the middle band of the pigprice guarantee will be raised by 400, 000 pigs in the next Annual Review,without prejudice to decisions on price arising from other factorsexamined at the Review.8.     The Agriculture Ministers second and third propositions concerned the formulae to be used in interpreting the assurances on productivity and milk prices in the 1966 Review White Paper, which have been underdiscussion with the Farmers Union since March.    Agreement wasreached in my Committee, subject to drafting agreed since, on theterms in which the Minister of Agriculture should announce the outcome of the talks with the Farmers Unions on paragraph 64 of the review white Paper.    This paragraph reads as follows -
&quot;This programme is based upon the maintenance of an increasing rate of productivity.    The government recognise that this rising productivity must be used notonly to help meet rising costs, but also to finance furtherinvestment and improve the income, and so the standardof living, of the full-time commercial farmer.    TheGovernments recognition of this will be a basic factorinfluencing their determinations at future Annual Reviewsduring the period ox the present Plan.    Further dis-cussions on this matter will be held with the Farmers1Unions during the year.&quot;9.     The Minister v/ill refer to an agreement which has been reached with the Farmers&apos; Unions on additional economic data for future annual reviews, and will say that it is the Governments intention in interpretingthis assurance to create the conditions in which full-time commericalfarmers can use a reasonable part of their rising productivity to financeany necessary further investment, and to increase their net incomes and so their standard of living, although this will naturally need to becarried out within the principles of the Governments prices and incomes policy.    The operative words aro, of course, &quot;a reasonable part&quot;, andthese words, together with the qualification concerning compliance with prices and incomes policy, represent a fair solution which goes as faras the Government can be expected to go.10.     The other formula under discussion with the Farmers1 unions concerned the reduction of the pool price for milk, as a result ofadditional milk production arising from extra, calves for the beefexpansion programme.    The White Paper (paragraph 9) said:-&quot;The Government also recognise that if the dairy herd isexpanded to meet the need for increased beef production,and the increased milk production due to this expansionof the herd has to be sold for purposes other than liquidconsumption, this could result in a dilution of the poolprice and they give an assurance that they will take these facts into account in the determinations on milk at futureReviews within the period of the present Pla-n.    further discussions on this assurance on milk will be held withthe Farmers1 Unions during the year. &quot;11.     Following the discussior. in the Agricultural Policy Committee itis now agreed among the Departments concerned that the minister should state that &quot;in our talks with the Farmers1 Unions we have agreed on the method to be used for calculating in terms of pence per gallonhow far the pool price for milk would be diluted by a given expansionof the dairy herd to produce more beef.    This figure will be includedin Annual Review Statistical Data and it is the Governments intention that this measure of reduction in the pool price to dairy farmers shouldbe given full weight along with other factors when the milk guarantee is determined&quot;.      I recommend this formula to the Cabinet.-3-
12.     It has not, however, been possible to reach agreement on the agriculture Ministers&apos; proposal for an announcement that theGovernment has informed the banks that productive investment inagrictdture and horticulture should receive the same priority as regardscredit as productive investment in manufacturing industry.    TheFinancial Secretary to the Treasury was not able to agree to thisproposition, but the balance of opinion in my Committee was that itwould be right for a   statement to be made putting credit for agricultureon the same basis as credit for manufacturing industry, subject to the overriding priority of credit for manufacturing exports, and providedthat this did not imply any relaxation of the total volume of creditavailable.    The statement might also make clear that the provision of credit for purely seasonal purposes was excluded from the creditrestrictions.    It would, of course, be necessary for the Chancellorsagreement to be sought to these recommendations.    I regret to reportthat in the event the Chancellor^ approval for this recommendation wasnot forthcoming, and I am unable to report agreement on this matter,which is therefore still open.    I understand that in view of the difficulties that have arisen about it, the Minister of Agriculture may now wish toput his case direct to the Cabinet in a separate paper.D. H.7 0, Whitehall, S.
