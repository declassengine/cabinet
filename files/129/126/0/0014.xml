A TRICES AND INCOMES STANDSTILLNote by^ OfficialsIt has been suggested that, as one of a series of measuresto meet the immediate economic situation the Government mightdeclare a freeze (which might best be officially called a&quot;standstill&quot;) on increases in prices and incomes for a specified period.2.     Experience during and since the War suggests that verylittle reliance could be placed on legal enforcement for thispurpose.      No satisfactory and acceptable way was found duringthe War of controlling directly increases in pay.      Earlyattempts at price control in 1939/UO had little success untilrice control was linked with elaborate controls over qualitythe Utility schemes), rationing, state trading, Exchequersubsidies, etc. backed by a very large administrative machine.3-     This suggests that the proposed standstill will have to rely largely on voluntary co-operation.      It will have in anycase to start on a voluntary basis until any legislative pov/ersare enacted.     This emphasises that the scheme for a freezemust &quot;be of a kind which will be generally accepted by thecommunity as necessary in the national interest.     Prom a strictly economic point of view the present need is to combinea freeze on money incomes with measures te reduce demand.But in practice a pay freeze would be regarded as tolerableby trade unions and public opinion only if it was accompaniedlay a comparable standstill en prices and dividends.Type and period of Standstillh.     There is no possibility of an absolute freeze on prices.On the incomes side there is a br&amp;ad choice between an attemptto secure either a complete freeze for a short period or a standstill with some provision for exceptions for a longer period.5.     Te be most effective the first course would provide forne exceptions (even for lowest paid workers or for productivity)There would be a prohibition on the implementation of existing commitments, including pay increases due under long termagreements and on the payment of wage and salary incrementsfor the period of the freeze,     A complete freeze of this kind would involve pretty rough justice for many groups and, in sofar as prices rose, would involve a cut in real incomes.    Itwould probably not therefore be possible to sustain it for morethan six menths.      Negotiations and arbitration and reports bythe N.B.P.I. would continue, and agreements reached would be implemented at the end of the six months period.6.     A short but complete freeze could be expected to have animmediate and dramatic impact, both on home costs and on over-seas opinion.      It would have the appearance of greaterequality of treatment even though the treatment vrould beharsher, but the anomalies and inequities would accumulate overthe six months, and there eould be a flood of pent-up increasesat the end of the period, whioh could be very damaging.     Six
months would be a very short period in which to make effectivearrangements for an orderly and moderate pattern of pay increases to follow the freeze.      Making the freeze effectiveso long as it lasts is likely to take up most of the Government&apos;senergies during this period,7-     The second course v/ould involve a less crude approach topay increases and could therefore be sustained for a longer period, say 12 months.      But it would have a much less immediateimpact, particularly if existing commitments and cases in thepipe-line were allowed as exceptions.      Once some exceptional cases are admitted, it becomes very difficult to draw the line.The main advantages cf the second course are that it v/ould belikely to be more acceptable and therefore more effective andthat it would provide a longer period in which to plan for the orderly growth of incomes following the standstill.     although there would be very considerable difficulties in defining the criteria for exceptions and operating the machinery for applyingthem, these criteria and the machinery could continue to beused with any modification thought desirable after the stand-still period.8.     It might be possible to combine elements of both these courses by having a year&apos;s standstill v/hich provides forstrictly limited exceptions together with a six-month defermentof all increases   under existing commitments, including annualincrements, due in the course of the year.      This would combinesome of the advantages (as well as the disadvantages) of bothcourses.Legislative provision9.      Since it would be impossible to enforce detailed controls over prices and pay by law, there would be no advantage in introducing detailed legislation.      Even if it were possibleto take comprehensive statutory powers of control fairly quickly,it would take a considerable period to build up ths machineryneeded for enforcement, by which time many people would have&quot;jumped the gun&quot;.10.    It would, however, be desirable to support the request fora standstill with some statutory powers, if only to deter someof those who deliberately set out to flout the policy.     Thealternative possibility of fitting selective provisions intothe Prices and Incomes Bill is discussed in para.   38 (iii) below.11.    It should be recognised that even if the standstill werereinforced by some statutory powers, it could not be expectedto be completely effective.      But given a reasonable measureof public support it could be sufficiently effective tostrengthen the economy In the short-term,\ \1 -i -4
Incomes standstill1.2.    In principle it would be necessary to call fcr a standstill on all personal incomes, including incomes of self-employed persons, fees, dividends, etc., if it wore not to be regarded asdiscriminating unfairly against wage and salary earners.     Inpractice it would be difficult to make a standstill effectiveexcept in respect of those wages, salaries and feos which arenegotiated.13.    One of the biggest problems is how to treat existing commit-mentSo      These fall into several categories(a) pay increases due under agreements already in force.    Inthe 12 months to 31st July, 1967 increases in wage rates or reductions in hours (or both) averaging 5.5% perannum are due under existing agreements to about 5 millionmanual workers (about a third of the total number of wage earners) including workers in engineering and shipbuilding,  iron and steel, and railways.      There isno commitment at present outstanding.in respect of thenon-industrial Civil Service, although about 60,000civil servants are due for increases under pay research.(b) Pay increases recently agreed but not yet in operation.Examples are electrical contracting, local authority manual and non-manual workers.      In some cases thesettlement and its implementation may have been delayedas a result of Government pressure.     Wages Councilproposals not yet approved by the Minister of Labourmight be regarded as falling in this category,(c) About two million workers are covered by cost of livingsliding scale arrangements, mainly in construction,iron and steel, printing and hosiery,(d) Some groups are expecting pay increases as a result ofaction taken rr supported by the Government.      examples are the dockers, railwaymen, policemen and Governmentindustrial workers.(e) Some workers have contractual rights to pay increasesat future dates, which employers could not be expectedto abrogate on a voluntary basis;    others are entitledto pay reviews.      Civil Service P.R.U. Surveys coveringever.a quarter of a million civil servants are due for completion by the middle of next year.(f) Many salaried workers (and some wage-earners) receivepay increases in the form of annual increments on a scale.14.    These forward commitments pose a difficult dilemma.    If a standstill is introduced on the basis that they are to be honoured(as was done in the 1961/62 pay pause) its effectiveness would bemuch reduced and it would be regarded as falling unjustly on thoseworkers who by chance or for other reasons (including pressure fromthe   Gavernment in some cases) are not covered by an existingcommitment.      On the other hand to deprive large numbers ofworkers of pay increases to which the employers have agreed wouldbe no less unpopular and,  so far as the private sector isconcerned, might be impracticable.
15.    If the standstill made any provision for exceptions itwould he necessary in addition to declaring a norm&quot; of zero -(a) to lay down much more stringent criteria for decidingexceptions, probably with a relatively low upper limit on exceptional increases;(b) to channelV exceptional cases through the Board, since it would otherwise be very difficult to control them.This would call for a re-thinking of the scope and functions of the Board,  since a very large number ofcases might need to be handled over a short period oftime.16.    The functions of statutory wage-fixing bodies would need tobe modified or suspended;    arbitration awards would have to conform to the criteria laid down by the Government or would haveto be put in&quot; abeyance for the standstill period.17.    There would in practice bp no effective way of preventingpay increases at work-place, site or factory level, nor would this necessarily be desirable in a case where a pay increase wasthe only way of getting work done.     There would be widespreadpressure from workers, if the cost of living increased signifi-cantly during the standstill period.      There would be no effective way of preventing collusion between employers and individualemployees to secure pay increases through upgrading, reclassifi-cation of jobs, etc.      The attempt to impose a legal standstill on pay increases would be strongly resented by some if not alltrade unions.      If pressed very far it would result in strike action and a general worsening of industrial relations.18     The main danger of a complete standstill (which would applyto a lesser extent to the less rigid forms) is that the pressure for pay increases which would build up during the standstillperiod, &quot;    &quot;. ; exacerbatedby the inevitable feelings of unfairnesswould result in a spate of increases as soon as it was over whichwould nullify the economic advantage that had been gained.      Itwould be necessary, therefore, to try to phase out the increasesat the end of the standstill in accordance with priorities that had been worked out in agreement with the T.U.C. and C.B.I.and with the assistance of the N.B.P.I.     Alternatively, by using amended powers under Part II of the Prices ctnd Incomes Billit might be possible to ensure that the implementation of settle-ments reached during the standstill period and subsequently wasdeferred fcy up to six months from the date of the settlement.19.    The standstill would have to be imposed rigorrusly inrespect of the pay of public servants and employees of nationalised industries.      It would probably be desirable for statutory direc-tions to be issued to the Boards of nationalised industriesforbidding - them to increase rates of pay without Ministerialconsent.      It would be necessary to secure similar restraint onthe part of local authorities.      It would probably be difficultto avoid a widening discrepancy between the treatment of employees in the public and private sectors.     This would &quot;be strongly resented by employees in the public sector.
prices standstill20.    It would be impossible to secure a complete standstill over thewhole field of goods and services. There are important differences between movements of incomes and of prices because of the directinfluence on prices of e.g. increases in Purchase Tax and of world market prices of food and raw materials.   Nevertheless the tradeunions would expect every effort to be made to have a standstill onall types of prices and charges.    Management also would tend to feelthat it would be unfair if the standstill on prices covered only apart of the field.21.   An attempt to secure by statutory control that no prices woreincreased would tend to be ineffective unless extensive machinery,involving very large staffs, was devised to control prices and policethem.   Moreover in much of the consumer goods field it is almost impossible to define price except in relation to quality, style, etc.e.g. clothing and furniture.   Given wartime experience,  it is clearthat the controls would have to extend to defining quality.  .22.    Initially there would have to be a voluntary approach with anappeal to all concerned not to increase prices and the responsewould depend on the reception of the proposed Government measures asa whole.   This should apply to all prices and charges.23.   But for the statutory phase it would seem unavoidable that themain emphasis should be placed on a selective approach resting on the list of goods and services covered by the current voluntary early warning and standstill arrangements.    It should be possible to extend this list somewhat, though groups such as clothing and imported foodsand foods subject to seasonal fluctuations could not readily be covered.    It might be possible, however, to develop the technique in use by the Ministry of   Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood of keepingcertain food prices under constant watch to apply over a wider field.2k.   For all the items listed, there would be a statutory early warningcovering an initial period of up to three months (or possibly oven sixmonths) and a total period of up to one year if the proposed pricechange was referred to the N.B.P.I.25.   The criteria for judging whether a case existed for a price increase would need to be narrovred, compared with those set out inthe White Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd.2639).    But thefollowing would have to be accepted from the outset as reasonable grounds for seeking an increase:(a) Increases in the cost of imported materials;(b) Marked seasonal factors;(c) Increases in costs imposed by the Government such asSelective Employment Tax and increases in indirect taxation./26.
26.   Provision night also be made in the Prices and Incomes Billto the effect that where a price not covered by the early warning requirement had been increased and had been referred tothe N.B.P.I., the Government should have power, if the Board sorecommended, to require the enterprise to lower its price to theoriginal level.   As in the case of incomes references, the Boardv/ould have to be organised to be able to deal with large numbersof cases on the basis of more stringent and precise criteria.27.    It would be important to try to enlist the Immediatesupport of larger firms, both in manufacturing and in distribution.If a number of the largest firms were willing to give specificpledges this would be a valuable example to the business community as a whole.28.    Inevitably, the public v/ould tend to expect most prices toremain unchanged and there v/ould no doubt be a large flow of complaints about price changes.    These v/ould at least provide some help in watching the behaviour of firms and might make it possible to take some exemplary action against unjustifiableincreases.29o   Givon a measure of deflation in the economy and somecheck to incomes increases, the   climate might in time    nbecome more favourable to holding prices.    But it mustbe remembered that prices have shown greater stabilitythan incomes over the past year and that some recent/large6.
large increases in labour costs have not yet been reflected inprices.     The initial phase of the standstill might thereforeprove difficult, particularly if there was any real lag betweenannouncement and legislation.Charges by Natijpjflal.ised^ M^^U^PJSSJ^^^^^^^^S^^ 30.     The price standstill would need to apply with particularrigour to the prices and charges of the nationalised industries.This would mean in practice that no price or charge could beincreased without reference to and a favourable report from.B.P.I.      In so far as charges are fixed by independent statutorybodies (e.g. London passenger fares) special legislative pro-visions might be necessary&apos; .31.     As far as other public sector prices and charges are con-cerned, the position is less straight-forward because some ofthem e.g. charges for school meals reflect public expenditure and taxation considerations.     An increase in charges of this type could best be presented as part of the measures to reducepublic expenditure.Rents. jand ^R at e s32.     Rents give rise to difficulty.      In the public sectorthere is already a wide measure of suosidisation and if rent increases were held up there would be pressure on localauthority finance.     This could be eased only by increasedExchequer assistance or by increases in rates.     But a consid-erable number of wage earners would expect local authority rentsto be frozen if their pay was being frozen, particularly iftaxation had been increased.33.   Private sector rents are now subject to the machinery ofthe Rent Act 1965, which allows for reduction as well asincreases.     But here again, the public generally would, expectrents to be covered by a prices and incomes standstill.3k.     Although rates are a form of taxation, they are also a significant element in the cost of living index.      Substantialfurther increases in rates seem inevitable on present policies,but it hardly seems realistic to envisage a real standstill onincreases in rates./Mortgage11-7-
.&apos;......- S2C88T35.     These could only &quot;be subjected to a standstill ifinterest rates generally were kept stable,pjjyidendjg36.     A standstill on dividends paid by individual companiesduring the twelve months would seem to be essential forpresentational and political reasons.     Provision might possibly be made for special treatment in cases approvedby the Government or approved by the N.B.P.I. but it is infact probable that dividends this year and next will on average be lower than last year especially with a more marked deflationary trend, so that a standstill might not give rise to undue difficulty.OJlhexJionex^^omes37-      It is open to the Government themselves to have aconsiderable influence on the incomes of Farmers,    the incomes of .^Qj^zPJ!^2z9X^^.^V^SlIl^. are more of a problem inthe circumstances of a general standstill.      It might benecessary to try to devise some arrangements forre-assuring public opinion that such incomes, particularlyall forms of professional fees, were being kept under constant watch so that any increases could be referredpromptly to the N.B.P.I.-8-
Summary; and Conclusions38.    (i) There is no possibility of bringing into existencerapidly the elaborate administrative machine that wouldbe needed to enforce statutory controls over prices and incomes.      In any case a standstill would need to become effective as soon as it was announced in order to avoidanticipatory increases in prices and pay.     For both these reasons it would be necessary to rely largely on voluntary co-operation.This means that a standstill would need to apply to prices, incomes and dividends and to treat them on abasis which was regarded by everyone affected asreasonably fair.There would be no advantage in introducing detailedlegislation for wage and price control, since this could not effectively be enforced.      But it might bedesirable to strengthen Part II of the Prices and incomes Bill bys-(a) extending the powers of compulsory standstill fromone month to three (or six) months in the firstinstance, and from four months to twelve months inall;(b) taking power to require prices to be lowered onthe recommendation of the N.B.P.I.j(c) to require notification of all existing commitments for increases in pay;(d) to indemnify employers for breach of contractresulting from the standstill;(e) to amend the.requirements of legislation relatingto Wages Councils, etc;(f) to impose a standstill on dividends.Standstill on Incomes(iv) There are two possible approaches:-(a) To impose a rigid standstill with virtually noexceptions for a period of six months..(b) To reduce the norm from 3i% to zero and to intro-duee more stringent criteria government treatmentof exceptional cases.     A less rigid standstill ofthis type might be maintained for twelve months.The main advantage of course (a) lies in its shocktreatment and the impression which this might make onforeign opinion.     The advantage of course (b) would lie in the fact that it gave greater scope for dealing withanomalies and obvious inequalities and would make it easier to control pay increases in an orderly fashionat the end of the standstill period.(ii)(ill)
(v) A possible combination of these approaches v/ould be torequire all increases due under existing commitments tobe deferred six months from the due date and to permitothex-1 increases on the recommendation of the N.B.P.I.(vi) It v/ould be necessary to lay down more stringent criteriagoverning increases in incomes and prices.      In particu-lar it would be necessary to make it clear that anyprice increases resulting from increases in indirect taxation or import prices were not to be regarded as justifying increases in pay.Pricei standstill(vii) It would be necessary to accept that increases in prices could still be justified by movements in import prices or seasonal factors ttr. by governmental action (for&apos;example, Selective Employment Tax or indirect taxation).(viii) In addition to an appeal for voluntary co-operation,use might be made of the statutory early warningrequirements (as extended in (iii) above). -Dividends(ix) Companies would need to be required net to increase their dividends for 12 months.Department of Economic Affairs,Storey&apos;s Gate,S   W   118th July 1966w seises?
