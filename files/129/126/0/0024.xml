E DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)introduction in this memorandum I set out the provisions which, with theagreement of the Home Affairs Committee, I propose to include inthe Criminal Justice Bill.    This Bill will be a major measure whichwill make a number of significant reforms in the penal system andin the criminal law and the procedure of the criminal courts.    I hopethat it will be possible to take Second Reading before Christmas.Release on licence2.      On 2nd December, 1965 (CC(65) 67th Conclusions, Minute 3)the Cabinet approved the publication of a White Paper on the AdultOffender.    The central proposal in the White Paper (Cmnd. 285 2),which the Bill will implement, is that a prisoner who has served one-third of his sentence or one year, whichever is the longer, may be released on licence subject to suitable conditions.    Prisoners will be carefully selected for this privilege in the light of their response to training and general progress in prison, and the over-riding considera-tion will always be whether early release is likely to involve any appreciable risk to the public.    Any prisoner released on licence willbe subject to recall to prison until the date on which he would have left it under the existing law.Persistent offenders3.      The Bill will also implement the White Paper!s proposal thatthe sentences of preventive detention and corrective training shouldbe abolished, and that the courts should be empowered instead toimpose a persistent offender a longer sentence, subject to a statutory maximum, than that appropriate for the offence of which hewas convicted.    To offset this, prisoners in this category will be eligible to benefit by the arrangements for release on licence.4.      There has been widespread support in principle for theseproposals, particularly for the concept of release on licence - though we may expect some debate on questions such as the minimumqualifying period for release.C(66) 1242nd August. 1966CABINETCRIMINAL JUSTICE bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome, Department-1-
Short terms of imprisonment5.     Many people are sent to prison unnecessarily for short terms.In my view this blunts rather than sharpens the deterrent effect of imprisonment.    It also overcrowds our gaols with prisoners for whomno worth while remedial treatment can be provided,    I propose, to tackle this problem in four ways.(a) Suspended sentences6.      The Bill will introduce the suspended sentence into our penalsystem, by empowering courts to suspend any sentence of imprison-ment of two years or less.     A substantial body of informed opinionsupports the principle of the suspended sentence, and will welcome its introduction.7.     I also propose that, where an offender is dealt with for an offence which is not one involving violence against the person or asexual assault, and the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment of six months or less, it shall be required to suspend the sentence if the offender has not previously been sentenced to imprisonment or borstaltraining.    The restriction on the powers of the courts will not be welcomed by all sentencing authorities, but in my view it is essential if we are to make a substantial impact on the problem of shortsentences;   and the exception for offences of violence should meetmost objections of substance.(b) Offenders sentenced for drunkennes8.       When the development of hostels and other institutions hasadvanced far enough to secure sufficient accommodation of the righttype, imprisonment will not in my view be necessary as a directpenalty for the offence of being drunk and disorderly.    I therefore propose that the Bill should provide that, when the Secretary of state is satisfied that sufficient suitable accommodation is available for thetreatment and care of those convicted of drunkenness offences, he maymake an order providing that the offence of being drunk and disorderlyis no longer punishable with imprisonment.(c) Enforcement of Fines9.      The Bill will empower courts to attach the earnings or otherincome of fine defaulters and will restrict the present powers of thecourts to commit the defaulter to prison.    In my paper to the HomeAffairs Committee I proposed that courts should have power to commita defaulter to prison without giving him time to pay only if it appeared that either -and that once a court had given time to pay it should not commit adefaulter unless it had tried and failed to extract the fine by attach -ment of ea.rn.ings or income.    The Home Affairs Committee asked(a)(b)he was able to pay straight away,   orhe was likely to disappear without paying;-2-
me to consider further whether the courts needed the power at (a)above, bearing in mind, among other things, that it might result ins ome offenders under the Prices and Incomes Bill being committed to prison forthwith.    My proposals already represent a considerablerestriction on the present powers of the courts (indeed the Secretaryof State for Scotland is disposed to think that they go too far in thisdirection) and we do not want the law to become too difficult to enforceagainst a defaulting offender.    On the other hand, I fully recognise the need to take full account of the position under the Prices and incomes Bill and I am considering the matter urgently in consultationwith my colleagues primarily concerned.(d)     Remands in custody10.     With the object of eliminating unnecessary detention beforetrial I propose to restrict the present unlimited powers of magistrates&apos;courts to remand or commit accused persons in custody rather than onbail by requiring bail to be offered, save in special definedcircumstances, in specified categories of minor offences.    Iamparticularly anxious that those who are most unlikely to be sent to prison, even if convicted, should not be kept in prison before trial.The Jury System11.     There has lately been strong criticism of abuses which are possible under the present jury system.    There has been a growing number of cases, involving serious crimes, in which there have beenattempts to bribe or intimidate jurors.    There have been other caseswhere a verdict of guilty has not been reached because one member ofthe jury, from a general dislike of the police or some similarprejudice, was not prepared in any circumstances to see a personconvicted.12.     I propose, as an immediate measure to meet these criticisms,that the Bill should provide for juries to be able to convict by majoritieof 10 to 2 instead, as at present, of reqtxiring unanimity.    The lord chief Justice has told me that the judges are unanimously in favour of majority verdicts.    In addition, because of public anxiety about thepresent volume of crime and the need for effective enforcement of thelaw, I have reached the view that this proposal would be generally acceptable to lay public opinion.    But a concession could be made during the passage of the Bill if it became clear that majority verdictswould be acceptable only if reached by eleven to one.    As a safe-guard against the too hastily reached majority verdict I propose toprovide that a verdict which is not unanimous may be reached after notless than two hours1 discussion.    In accordance with the conclusionof the Home Affairs Committee, I am giving some further thought tothe suggestion that a jury should be instructed to seek to reach amajority verdict only after it has reported to the judge its failure toreach a unanimous verdict after not less than two hours&apos; deliberation;and also to the question of how the judge should ensure that theverdict has been reached by an adequate majority.-3-
13,     We have yet to introduce the legislation to which we are committed to implement the recommendations of the DepartmentalCommittee on Jury Service.     This also concerns civil juries andwould not be suitable for implementation in a Criminal Justice Bill.I am preparing a separate Bill - which can be taken in a SecondReading Committee - to deal with the Committee&apos;s recommendationsbut I propose to act in the Criminal Justice Bill on the Committee^recommendation that persons convicted of serious crime should be disqualified, from serving on criminal juries, since this is a measurespecifically aimed at the mischiefs described in paragraph 11 above.The Cornmittee&apos;s recommendation was that conviction for seriouscrime should disqualify for five years,    I propose to extend this todisqualify for life those sentenced to five or more years&apos; imprisonment.Legal aid14.     I propose to include in the Bill the provisions necessary to giveeffect to the recommendations - which have been generally welcomed -of the Widgery Committee on Legal Aid in Criminal Proceedings.The three main proposals requiring legislation are (a) the introductionof a contributions scheme;  (b) the introduction of arrangements toenable persons convicted on indictment to obtain legal advice on grounds of appeal and (c) the adaptation of the statutory Legal AdviceScheme to make it more accessible to persons charged with a criminal offence.15.     Whereas the proposed contribution scheme involves legislation,the Committee&apos;s recommendations as to the circumstances in whichcourts should grant legal aid, which are likely to entail additional public expenditure, could be implemented by the courts under theirpresent powers.    I therefore propose, when announcing theGovernments acceptance of the Committee&apos;s recommendations, toemphasise the desirability of viewing them as parts of a single schemeto be put into effect at the same time.Preliminary proceedings before examining justices16.     Early in 1965 the Government announced their intention to giveeffect to the Byrne report (which recommended a limited use ofwritten evidence in committal proceedings) and the Tucker report(which recommended restrictions in the reporting of these proceedings).It is now clear, however, that there is considerable support for goingmuch further than the limited changes recommended by the Byrnereport.    I propose that committal-proceedings shall be held only ifthe prosecution or the defence want therm (the defence will have had anopportunity to study the written statements of prosecution witnesses inadvance) and that, where they are held, oral evidence should be givenonly by those witnesses from whom either side want it; the remainder of the evidence will be in writing,17.     As regards the Tucker recommendations, the case for restricting press reports rests at present on no more than a balanceof opinion, but if committal proceedings in their present form are tobe the exception rather than the rule it would be wrong for pre-trialpublicity to be given only to the exceptional case.    I therefore propose-4-
to restrict press reports of such proceedings as shall be held,reserving to the accused the right to require that the restrictionshould not apply if he thinks publicity v/ould help him (e. g. bydispelling rumour or bringing in witnesses who would not otherwise have known of the case),    I also propose to accept a recommendationof the Criminal Law Revision Committee that accused persons shouldbe required to give notice before the trial of any defence of alibi they propose to raise.Other amendments to court procedure18.     I consider that the time has come to modify the procedure for bringing those charged with trivial offences (e. g. parking offences)before the court by (i) allowing trials to proceed in the absence of the accused even if the summons has not been acknowledged, and giving anew trial to those who claim ignorance of the summons;  and (ii)prohibiting the use of warrants of arrest to bring trivial offendersbefore the court in the first instance.    Following recommendationsof the Criminal Law Revision Committee I propose to allow greaterscope for written evidence in all criminal proceedings and the use of formal admissions of facts that v/ould otherwise have to be strictlyproved.    Most of these proposals (and certain other minor ones) aredirected to improving efficiency and saving time.Amendments to the Frison Act 195 219.     The Bill will make various amendments to the Prison Act 1952.The most important is the abolition of corporal punishment fordisciplinary offences in prison.     This may be opposed by the prison officers, but it is a degrading form of punishment out of keeping withthe aims and methods of modern penology.Increase of maximum fines20.     The Bill will increase the maximum fines which may be imposedfor a number of offences.    Many of these fines were fixed years ago,and have become inadequate with the fall in the value of money.Consequential changes will be made in the tariff of terms of imprison-ment to be served in default of fines.Fingerprints and palmprints21.     At present, when a person not less than 14 who has been takeninto custody is charged with an offence before a magistrates  court,the court may order him to be fingerprinted.    I propose that this power should be extended to include palmprints, and to cover caseswhere an offender appears in answer to a summons for any offencepunishable with imprisonment.     I think that public opinion generallywill approve this comparatively minor extension, which will be ofconsiderable assistance to the police - and would indeed be preparedto go further if it could be shown that this would be useful.-5-
Probation and after-care22.     The Bill will make a number of changes on points of detailrelated to probation and after-care.    Most of these changes implementrecommendations made by the Departmental Committee on the probation Service (the Morison Committee) in 1962 and by the AdvisoryCouncil on the Treatment of Offenders.Minor and miscellaneous provisions23.     I shall also take the opportunity to make various minor andtechnical improvements in the administration of the criminal law.Conclusion24.     I seek the approval of the Cabinet to the proposals for the criminal Justice Bill set out in this paper, subject to my reaching agreement with the First Secretary of State and the Attorney-general on the extent of the courts1 powers to commit fine defaulters to prison (paragraph 9 above).tR.
