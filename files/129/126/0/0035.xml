JC(66) 135 COPY-NO.      fi ?27th September, 1966CABINETDOCKS; EMPLOYMENT AND pay memorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic affairs on Friday, 23rd September the Ministerial Committee on there organisation of the Docks considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour on employment and pay in the docks.    As the Cabinet know,the Governments aim is to introduce full decasualisation of dock labour,as recommended in the Devlin Report of 1965, in advance of nationalisa-tion of the ports, which cannot come into effect for some years.    Ifreasonable progress cannot be made, we shall strengthen the hands ofthose in the docks who are arguing that there is no point in making anyfurther changes in dock labour arrangements until nationalisation.Moreover, tension is building up in the docks, and the risks of industrial action will be increased if some signs of progress do not soon becomeappar ent.2.      The Minister of Labour has now received reports bySir George Honeyman on the objections to the draft revised Dock labour scheme (DLS) and by a committee under Lord Devlin on the changes of pay needed as the corollary to the introduction of permanent employment.3.      No special problems arise on the Honeyman Report, and the ministerial Committee agreed that the Government should accept it inprinciple and declare their willingness to act on its recommendations.4.      The main recommendations of the Devlin Report are:-(a) Abolition of attendance money and the payment instead of a regular wage with a minimum daily rate; improvements inthe pension scheme; and introduction of a sick pay scheme.These are accepted as the inescapable basic costs of decasualisa-tion.    They would add 6 per cent to the wage bill, but the improved productivity resulting from a system of regular employment is expected to achieve a broadly equivalentsaving.(b) The introduction of a weekly modernisation payment of 40/-,which would add a further 10 per cent to the wage bill.This cannot be immediately justified by an increase in productivity, but is required to give a &quot;send-off&quot; to thenew scheme.-1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)
(c)    The provision of a weekly guarantee of  15, the cost of which,given effective working practices, is expected to be negligible.w5.      Looking at this from the point of view of the docks, a satisfactorypay settlement ia an essential condition of introducing decasualisation and efficient working.     The Devlin recommendations will not be easy for theUnions to accept; they approximate closely to the employers&apos; proposals,and fall far short of the Unions1 claim (which admittedly they can never have expected to achieve).     But the proposals present substantialdifficulties against the background of prices and incomes policy.6.     Immediate implementation would in any case be excluded by the standstill.    The Government are proposing that during the succeedingperiod of severe restraint pay increases related to improvements in productivity should be permitted, but only on the understanding that the increases in pay are directly related to genuine and current improve -ments in productivity;   payments in exchange for unspecified promiseswill not qualify.    Similarly it must be expected that after the period of severe restraint we shall need to continue to insist that increases in pay for improvements in productivity are genuinely related to actualimprovements.    It can reasonably be argued that the 6 per cent increase to the docks wage bill arising as the inescapable basic costs of decasualisation qualify under this sort of criterion.    But the intro-duction of the proposed modernisation payment without any directrelationship to definite changes . in working practice would be difficultto justify and present in relation to incomes policy.7.      The Ministerial Committee on the Reorganisation of the Docksconcluded that the Government could only accept the modernisationpayment on the basis that actual payment, possibly by instalments, was directly related to specific changes in working practices, ape,rt fromchanges directly associated with deca.sualisation.    The Chairman ofthe National Modernisation Committee (Lord Brown) gave us to under-stand that it would be possible to attach a schedule of such practices,the elimination of which could be made a condition of the modernisationpayment.    The Minister of Labour is circulating, under cover of aseparate note, examples of what might be included in such a schedule.The Ministerial Committee thought that, if the references to the incomes policy background were made sufficiently strong and the modernisationpayment were made conditional upon the elimination of specificpractices, over and above changes directly associated with decasualisa-tion, the Government could reas onably accept the Devlin pay proposals and encourage the employers and the unions to do likewise.    We must,however, realise that, if we atta.ch specific conditions to the modernisa-tion payment in this way, we shall be proposing something less favourable to the men than Devlin, who envisaged the modernisationpayment as a cash &quot;send-off&quot; for decasualisation without furtherconditions, to be followed in individual docks by further productivitybargains which would further increase earnings.    We may thus beadding to the difficulty of reaching agreement between the employersand the unions.-2-
8.      There remains the problem of timing.     These changes could notin any case be made during the standstill.    The revisions to the dock labour Scheme will have to be discussed with both sides of the industryand incorporated in an Order, and the new licensing arrangements willhave to be brought into operation.    On this basis the Minister of Labourenvisaged that the revised Dock Labour Scheme and the pay changes couldbe brought into effect in March 1967, though the date would not be announced at this stage.    Some other members of the Committeerecognised the importance of making progress in the docks, but sawgreat   difficulty about implementing these changes during the period of severe restraint, and thought that implementation should be deferred until July 1967.    The Minister of Labour is anxious to make an early announcement about the Honeyman and Devlin Reports, and the ministerial Committee concluded that it was not necessary for theGovernment to commit themselves at this stage on the timing ofimplementation; they thought that at this stage the timing could be left open in any announcement made by the Minister of Labour, and adecision taken later on, when the criteria for the period of severe restraint had been established and the prospect for the period wasclearer.9.      The Minister of Labour considers that there would be advantage in publishing the Devlin and Honeyman Reports and announcing theGovernments acceptance of them in principle on 3rd October.    Theannouncement would include, at the request of the Minister of Transport,a statement of the Government^ intention to proceed with estuarialreorganisation schemes along the lines of paragraph 112 of the white paper on Transport Policy.Conclusion10.     The Cabinet are asked to agree that the Devlin and HoneymanReports should be published on 3rd October and should be accompaniedby a Government statement:-(a) making it clear that it will be several years before nationalisationcan become operative and that during the interim period it isimportant that a system of regular employment should beintroduced in the docks (this will entail assm-ances on theposition of existing employees upon nationalisation);(b) stating the Governments acceptance of the Honeymanrecommendations and their willingness, subject to consultation with both sides of the industry, to incorporate the amendments recommended in a revised Dock labour scheme^(c) Commending the Devlin recommendations in principle to bothsides of industry, recognising that their implementation is directly relevant to the introduction of a system of regular employment, but stressing the incomes policy backgroundagainst which they have to be considered and implementedand emphasising that the modernisation payment proposedmust be conditional upon definite and specific improvements in productivity and the elimination of restrictive practices,over and above the changes directly associated withdeca.sualisation:
(d)    announcing the Government^ intention to proceed withestuarial reorganisation schemes as proposed in the \7hitePaper on Transport Policy.11.     I have asked the Minister of Labour to circulate for considerationby the Cabinet the draft of an announcement which he would propose tomake if these proposals are endorsed by the Cabinet.M.
