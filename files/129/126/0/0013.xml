EXCHANGE   CONTROL   MEASURESNote by the TreasuryA.    RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL ABROADOne course would be to introduce a limit of  50 per head on holiday travel (excluding fares) in the non-Sterling Area.   travel in the Sterling Area would remain unrestricted.,   A  50 limitwould be announced as being fully in force from 1st November,  1966for one year, the implication being that thereafter it would be revised upwards or abolished.2.     It would not be practicable to introduce the new limit at once in the middle of the holiday season.   We can, however, take somemeasures to prevent people accumulating foreign exchange now for expenditure next year (see below).The facts3.     Travel has been unrestricted since 1959-   Expenditure in thenon-Sterling Area has risen from  208 million in 1965 &quot;to 227 million this year and is forecast at  241 million in 1967.The deficit on travel account with non-sterling countries isexpected to rise from  81 million in 1965 &quot;bo  95 million in 1966and  104 million in 1967-Estimated savings4.     The following estimates have been made of savings that mightbe made on expenditure forecast for 1967s-Allowance per person Saving   m.NIL 17550 4960 3875 25100 12These estimates must be treated with considerable reserve.   No allowance ismade for evasion, which may be1 considerable;the lower the limit the more likely thereis to be evasion.1.
International obligations5.     Restriction on travel expenditure would require the priorconsent of the International Monetary Fund under Article VIII ofthe Agreement and also derogation under the O.E.C.D. Code of liberalisation of Current Invisible Operations (with an obligation to reverse the derogation within eighteen months).Also it would be contrary to the terms of UNI SCAN Declaration.Domestic difficulties6.     A restriction to, say,  50 would be widely unpopular andwould result in administrative difficulties for the banks andtravel agents.    Longer trips, e.g. to the United States, wouldbecome difficult or impossible, but the ordinary family should beable to manage Western Europe.    Average expenditure a head on holiday travel in Western Europe has been estimated at between 40 and  45.Timing7.     Because of prior commitments of both travel agents for packagetours and of individuals for their own bookings, it would not be practicable to enforce a new  50 limit until 1st November.During the intervening period there would be no restriction on sterling payments through travel agents, but the amount of foreign currency any one person could have would be limited to  50 unless they had already made bookings and had already given firminstructions to their bankers for more money.   This is only a partial solution of the difficulty, but is the best we can devise.It would be criticised on the grounds that people could havewhatever hotel accommodation they liked, however expensive, andhave  50 for spending, provided they booked through a travel agent,but would be restricted to  50 for everything if they booked theirown hotels.    But by far the largest amount of travel agencybookings is for cheap package tours.    Applications fromindividuals who had made hotel bookings direct (or who had madefirm plans for their holidays) costing more than  50 a head wouldbe dealt with by delegating authority to the banks&apos; to give extraexchange where evidence of hotel bookings was produced.Applications where there was no clear evidence would beconsidered by the Bank of England.administrative on8.     The new limit can be brought in under existing Exchange Controlpowers by means of a Notice to the market.    The Bank have thenecessary forms available to operate the interim arrangements at once.2.SECRET
Consequential changes to date from 1st ^November,  19669.     We recommend that if the ordinary travel allowance is  50a head we should leave business travel at  20 per day but would reduce the total amount per journey from  1,500 to  1,200.10.   We would introduce the following other changess-(1)   Reduce permitted export of sterling notes from 25 per head to  15.   This will mean strictersupervision by Customs at the ports andairports.(2)    Reduce annual cash gifts from  250 to  50.(3)    Introduce a car allowance (mainly for petrol)of  25 (motor cycles  15).(4)    The health allowance would be cut from  10 per dayeach for patient and companion to  7 per dayeach.    (The allowance does not include medicalexpenses.)(5)    Credit cardsIt would be necessary for the issuingcompanies to suspend their overseas facilitieshj 1st November at the latest.    The Bank ofEngland, however, will explore with the companieswhether it is possible for them to suspend these/&apos; facilities at an earlier date, say by 1st September.The amount which is expected to go out through this channel over and above the sums that will be permitted in the interim period should be smallbeing mainly a matter of payment for meals.Conelusion11.   As mentioned above, there would be evasion.   We cannot estimatehow much, but we certainly could not expect the net saving of a 50 limit and the consequential changes to be more than  40 million -and it could well be less.   By the same token, a  60 limit would produce a net saving of about  30 million, which could be less.3.
B-    EMIGRANTS&apos; REMITTANCESThe proposal12.   Emigrants may at present remit up to  5,000 per familyunit at the official rate of exchange.   Any balance of sterling capital in excess of this figure is blocked but isrealisable for foreign currency through the security sterlingmarket.   The proposal is to substitute realisation over aperiod of four years of all amounts above the  5,000 throughthe investment currency market instead of the s ecurity sterlingmarket.Cost of present arrangements13.   In 1965, 10,700 persons were granted emigration facilities.Their total sterling assets amounted to  39 million, of which 1h million was remitted at the official rate of exchange(an average of about  1,500).   About one-half of the balanceof emigrants&apos; assets, i.e. some  12 million, is thought tohave been realised through security sterling and the remainderleft invested in the United Kingdom.   The amounts for 1966 looklike being larger because an increasing number of wealthy people are emigrating.OcEoCD. obligations1h..   The 0.E.CD. Code of Capital Transactions requires theliberalisation of emigrants&apos; remittances.   The United Kingdom&apos;suse of security sterling is accepted as satisfying this requirement.Any action which restricted the ability of enigrants to maketransfers by one of the approved methods would oblige theUnited Kingdom to invoke the derogation clause of the Code on balance of payments grounds and to attempt to comply with its obligations again within eighteen months.    The approved methodsare official exchange, security sterling or investment currencyprovided the variations from the official rate of exchange are small.    It is likely that the O.E.C.D. would take the view thata change to the use of investment currency, if it remained at its present high level, would not satisfy the requirements ofthe Code.Case for a change15.     The present arrangements would be satisfactory if thesecurity sterling arrangements prevented any loss to the reserves as originally intended.
In some conditions of the sterling security market anincrease in the supply of security sterling, such as comes from emigrants realising their assets, is equivalent to a loss of foreign exchangej    in others to a postponement of thetime when foreign exchange could be expected to accrue tothe reserves.    In present circumstances, when the rate issignificantly below par, an increase in the supply of security sterling would put pressure on the rate but involve no immediate loss of exchange.   But such a loss could takeplace if the security rate were to rise to near parity withthe official rate as confidence in sterling is restored.Although we cannot therefore be certain about the preciseeffect of an increase in the supply of security sterlingit, is clear that the use of investment currency is a muchsurer way of safeguarding the reserves than operating throughsecurity sterling.16.    It is impossible to estimate to what extent the reserves would benefit as a result of the change.   This would dependon two elements:    the first would be how far the investmentcurrency premium led emigrants to keep more of their money &apos;in this country for the four-year period than would otherwise have been the case in order to avoid what amounts to about a25% tax on their capitalj    the second would depend on the degreeof saving to the reserves, if any, afforded by the presentrequirement that realisation above  5,000 should be throughsecurity sterling.    If, in the event, the protection to the reserves afforded by security sterling would have been negligible,then the saving resulting from changing to investment currencywould be considerable.17*     After the four-year period, emigrants would be free toremit any remaining balances at the security sterling rate.   Thescheme can therefore be represented as one to help us over a difficult period.Assessment&quot;16,      It is a tough measure which will give rise to complaintgiven that the investment currency premium is now over 25%,while the penalty for the use of security sterling would normally be only 1% or less.    It is bound to have-some effect on the investment premium but we cannot tell how much.    The very height of the premium will be an incentive for those emigrants who donot really need to realise their capital to leave it in the U.K.5-
(thereby increasing the relief to the reserves).   While thosewho wish to take their money will be free to choose when to buy foreign exchange and. how much.19.   In effect, we will be giving emigrants the same facilities(over and above their initial  5,000 at the official rate) to buy foreign exchange as other residents.   After the end ofthe four year period they will be entitled to t ake theirremaining balances at the security sterling rate like other non-residents.18th July, 1966Treasury Chambers,London, S.W.T.
