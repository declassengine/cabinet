Extension of Office control memorandum by Board of Tradein891.     In connection with further measures of restraints the Board ofTrade have been asked to consider an extension of the areas atpresent subject to control under the Control of Office &amp; IndustrialDevelopment Act, 1965.   These areas are (a) the Metropolitan Region(b) the Birmingham conurbation.2.     It would be technically difficult to extend the control to scotland because of the differences in planning legislation.   Moreover,it is assumed that it would not be intended to extend the control to those parts of the country that are to be designated: as development areas as soon as the Industrial Development Bill has been enacted,,These include the whole of Scotland except for Edinburgh and the surrounding district.3.     Of the remaining parts of England and Wales, a case can be made out for extending the control to the whole of the Midlands and theSouth East.   This could be done by making an order extending thecontrol to the East and West Midlands legions and to those parts ofthe South East Region outside the Metropolitan Region.   Congestionis increasing in these Regions;   The Board are already operating avery severe policy in dealing with applications for Industrial.Development Certificates, and control of office development would bea useful reinforcement of that policy.4.     If it were desired to extend the control beyond these Regions,the next step would be to cover certain additional large conurba-tions e.g. Bristol, Manchester, and the Leeds-Bradford area.   On thesame criteria, Cardiff should be included, but this would raisepolitical difficulties in relation to Edinburgh, which could not readily be brought within the control.   There is, however, no caseon grounds of congestion for an extension to these conurbations.5.     A further step would be to cover the whole of England and Walesoutside the new Development Areas.   The difficulty over Cardiffwould, however, still arise and the case on merits is even weakerthan that for extending control to the major conurbations.6. The control could be extended by an Order made on the day ofthe announcement to come into effect the following day. It wouldbe subject to affirmative resolution of both Houses.Board of Trade18th July, 1966.SECRET
