THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1966C(66) 117 Copy No. 6?20th July, 1966CABINETEUROPEAN LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENTORGANISATIONMemorandum by the Minister of aviation at their meeting on 30th June, the Cabinet authorised me(CC (66) 33rd Conclusions, Item 6) to confirm, at the EuropeanLauncher Development Organisation (ELDO) Ministerial conference to be held on 7th/8th July, the continued participation of theUnited Kingdom in the ELDO A programme and its agreement toparticipate in the further programme (ELDO-PAS) subject to thefollowing conditions:(i) With effect from 1st January, 1967, the United Kingdompercentage contribution should not exceed 27 per cent.(I was instructed to seek to reduce our percentagecontribution to 26 per cent, with a corresponding reduction in our total contribution, if the reportedwillingness of the French Government to increase theirpercentage proved to be accurate.)(ii) The United Kingdom total contribution for the financial years 1966-67 to 1971-72 should not exceed  44 T 8million.(iii) Satisfactory amendments to the Convention or to thefinancial protocol should be agreed whereby there wouldriot only be an annual review of the cost of the ELDOprogrammes but also provision for a number of breakpoints at which the United Kingdom could withdraw from further participation in the programme if theGovernment judged this desirable because of increasingcosts. (The Prime Minister subsequently authorised me,if it proved impossible to negotiate a provision forunilateral withdrawal, to settle for a formula whichwould provide that any increase in the overall ceilingneeded the unanimous vote of the member States.)7059A
2. My colleagues will wish to know that the outcome of theconference was that the Cabinefs conditions were met and we aretherefore able to continue participation in the ELDO programmes.Percentage contribution3. It was immediately apparent that neither the French norany other delegation was willing to increase its percentagecontribution above those suggested at the June session. Inevertheless tried privately and publicly to explore the possibility.All the delegations had, however, been authorised by their governments to accept the percentages which had then beensuggested. It being impossible to obtain a percentage contributionless than 27 per cent as authorised, I accepted this figure. the agreed contributions for the member States are therefore:Australia continues as at present, paying no fixed contributionbut providing facilities at Woomera.Total commitment4. The principle of safeguards against automatic commitment to escalating costs had been accepted at the previous meeting butthe consequential amendment to the financial protocol proved to bea contentious matter. Other member States were strongly opposedto giving any country a unilateral right to withdraw before the endof the programme and thus make nugatory all the work which hadbeen done in other States. But I secured in the end a cleardeclaration limiting our financial commitment to our share of the overall ceiling and giving us the right of unilateral withdrawal. in doing so I had to agree that, if a member country did not wish tocontribute to any expenditure above the fixed ceiling, it would be bound nevertheless to assure the completion of work allocated to it but I coupled this with the specific proviso that the member country would not thereby be liable for any costs in excess of its agreedshare of the overall ceiling. The condition laid down by mycolleagues in (iii) above was therefore met in full and I did not haveto rely on our fall-back position (the relevant text giving effect tothis agreement is at Annex A).Distribution of work and financial control5. The broad lines of an equitable distribution of workbetween member States were agreed. Whenever possible, however,the choice of contractor and the award of sub-contracts will bemade on the basis of tendering and of fixed prices.

control of the programmes the Secretariat will be responsible for placing contracts with firms in member States. There will beseparate Project Management Directorates, firstly for the completionof the Initial Programme, and secondly for the Perigee/Apogeesystem, each Directorate having full responsibility for the completionof their programme within the accepted technical specifications andfinancial limits. Member States will nominate a body of inspectors,responsible to the ELDO Council, who will undertake controlmissions. There will be meetings twice a year between expertsfrom member States and the prime contractors to review thetechnical progress and cost of programmes. There are to be annual reviews of progress at Ministerial level. The Final Resolutiongiving effect to our conclusions is reproduced at Annex B.Equatorial site6. The choice of an equatorial launching site lay betweenDarwin in Australia and Kourou in French Guiana. Although thebalance of technical considerations was in favour of the French site,I supported the Australian solution which had a marginal advantagefinancially. It was clear all other delegates were already committed to the French site. Under pressure, however, the French delegationoffered to provide the French Guiana site at a reduced fixed priceof  8-9 million. This saving of contingency provision reduced the overall ceiling by 5 million monetary units (about  2 million). the australians accepted defeat and it was not necessary for me also to declare against the Darwin site. The Australian delegation expressed their appreciation of our support. Test firings will continue atWoomera.The programme as it now stands7. As a result of the conference it is now agreed that the eldo A programme will be completed and that the furtherprogramme involving the development of a Perigee/Apogee system will be carried out. For purposes of contributions and overall ceilingthe two programmes are joined and become a new or furtherprogramme. A total ceiling of  118 million has been agreed for thecost of this work, covering the calendar years 1967-71. The UnitedKingdom contribution for the financial years 1966-67 to 1971-72 is limited to a maximum commitment of  41-27 million. This is about&apos; 3 million less than the  44-18 million based on our own estimates.F. M.Ministry of Aviation, S.W.1,18th July, 1966.7059
Annex A&quot; Should, in the opinion of a member State or the Secretary-General, the cost to completion of the programme be liable to exceed the overall ceiling of contributions approved by the member States,as given in column 4 of Annex II, paragraph 3, the Council shall atonce order an enquiry into the reasons for the overspend and after examination of the conclusions of such enquiry shall within 30 daysframe recommendations to the member States.The measures to be taken shall be determined by unanimous agreement of all member States. If such an agreement is not reachedwithin six months from the date the enquiry has been ordered bythe Council, any member State may declare that it cannot accept an obligation to contribute to any increase in the overall ceiling. If amember State declares that it does not wish to contribute to anyoverspend of the fixed ceiling, it will nevertheless be obliged to ensurethe completion of the work allocated to its contractors, withoutthereby incurring any liability to exceed the total financial commitment implied by the overall ceiling.&quot;Annex BTEXT OF RESOLUTION No. 1 ENTITLED ELDOPROGRAMMES AND ACTIVITIESThe conference of the Ministers of the member States of theEuropean Space Vehicles Launcher Development Organisation(CECLES/ELDO), meeting at Paris during the three sessions heldrespectively on 26th, 27th and 28th April, 9th and 10th June and 7th and 8th July, 1966, having reviewed all the problems of interestto ELDO in the light of the latest technological developments, therequirements  of  possible users,  the  questions  relevant to   aco-ordination of European space policy and the misgivings latterlyvoiced, wishing that ELDO should continue and complete the initialprogramme laid down in the convention establishing the organisation,and that the performance of the ELDO A launcher (Europa 1) builtunder this initial programme should be upgraded so that thelaunchers meet not only the requirements of the European space research Organisation (ESRO), but also the specifications of astationary communication satellite such as the one whose constructionis envisaged by the European Conference on Satellite Communica-tions (CETS), recalling its resolutions ELDO /CM (April 1966) 17and ELDO/CM (June 1966) 16, respectively adopted at its first and second sessions:1.
