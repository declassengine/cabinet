5.        If this exercise is to be successful, we shall have to devote more attention to the problem of communications.    Personal contact with firmsneeds to be strengthened and a far wider understanding of what myDepartment is doing and why must be encouraged.    Mass communication should not be ruled out even if the message reaches people for Whom it isnot specifically intended.    A better understanding by the public of theimportance of technology and a raising of its status in the public mind maybe a useful by-product of this.6. These are short-term measures and in the mid and long-term theDepartments efforts must be directed in the following directions^(i)     Stimulating the production of new and more labour- savingprocesses.(ii)    Developing British standards, aligning them with internationalmetric standards and insisting on their use for public procurement.(iii) Making a better use of the Government Research and Developmentresources including rationalisation and any advisable redeployment.(iv)    Helping to reorganise the structure of the engineering industries.(v) Increasing the supply and making better use of qualified engineersin engineering design and prodxiction.7. If these priorities and themes seem right, we should perhapsincorporate them into our campaign on productivity starting in the autumn.A.

APPENDIX1.       In 1965 the engineering industries contributed 15 per cent to the gross national product and 44 per cent of total exports.    They employed 17 per cent of the labour force.    An increase in output of 4 per cent and of exports of15 per cent between first quarter 1965 and first quarter 1966 was accompaniedby an increase in employment of I. 5 per cent.    An analysis of hours workedshows that output per man hour increased by 5 per cent while output per personemployed increased by only 3 per cent.    These figures (which are notseasonally adjusted) cover the whole of the engineering industry, including aircraft and shipbuilding and are shown in more detail in the Annex.2.      The available figures indicate an all too slow rate of increase in productivity in the engineering sector.    It is in this sector that theapplication of advanced technology and improved productivity can make the biggest contribution to economic growth.    The engineering industry not onlysupplies the bulk of exports and a large number of the goods (motor cars,television sets, refrigera.tors and the like) on which people spend their incomesafter their basic needs are satisfied, but they also supply the plant,machinery, instruments and vehicles on which improvements in the,productivity of all other industries largely depend.Man-power.      It is generally recognised that claims for reductions in standard hoursare at least in part a device for achieving higher incomes and are not usuallyfollowed by a corresponding reduction in actual hours worked.    However thefigures quoted in paragraph 1 above, and in the Annex, suggest that there is atrend towards choosing increased leisure and that the total of hours worked istending to decline.    In a sector of industry where labour, and particularlyskilled and qualified labour, is the scarcest resource, there is room forfurther study of the planned use of overtime.    Much emphasis is now being given to man-power planning and this aspect should not be ignored.4.      On other aspects of man-power planning in engineering, theEngineering Industries Training Board has got down to its tasks withcommendable speed and thoroughness.    The rapidly changing structure ofemployment required in industries where technological change is, or shouldbe, taking place rapidly presents problems of education and training at all levels.    In the mechanical engineering industries probably too much emphasis is placed by employers on requirements for, and shortages of, skilled labourand in some, e.g. machine tools, a good deal of de-skilling could take place with advantages to both the volume of production and to costs.    The trial period scheme for numerically controlled machine tools being run for us bythe National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) can be seen as a contribution to progress in this direction.5.      We are also making arrangements to buy pre-production models of advanced machine tools to assist their early introduction into manufacture andto obtain user evaluation.    I hope we can extend this type of arrangement toother types of advanced machinery and even to complete plants.    We need to do much more to encourage the changeover from labour intensive methods to capital intensive and to improve the capital/ output ratio.    The new investment Grants Scheme I believe will help but it is not a substitute fordemonstration.    British managements seem particularly reluctant tointroduce methods unless they can be proved to work: they wait for someoneelse to be first.-1-confidential 
CONF1DENT1AL6.      My Ministry keeps in close touch with the Engineering IndustriesTraining Board and with the Ministry of Labour on matters relating to training and employment of skilled workers, but our more direct concern is with requirements for qualified engineers and scientists and engineeringtechnicians.    The studies which are being conducted under the auspices ofthe Committee on Man-power Resources for Gcience and Technology, ( whichreports to me and the Secretary of State for Education and Science) provide amuch better basis for assessing and planning our future requirements in this field.    These studies and our own of particular industries continually bring to our attention the serious shortage of engineers, particularly of highlyqualified and gifted engineers, in the design and production departments of engineering firms.    Both education and publicity have a part to play inattracting more of the abler young people to the engineering profession andwe are sponsoring or assisting in a variety of activities in this field.7.      We are considering to what extent the large numbers of highlyqualified engineers in Government establishments and the United kingdom atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) should be re-deployed.    The foreseenreductions in the design teams required in the aircraft industry could alsohelp to ease the shortage elsewhere.8.      We intend to pursue in other industries the detailed studies of therequirements for particular qualifications which we have already carried outwith the makers and users of computers.    For computer staff we have established permanent arrangements with the firms concerned to keeprequirements \inder review and the Department of Educa-tion and Science have formed, a Committee on the provision on courses to meet the identified needsof industry.Management9.      The more economic and productive use of man-power depends above all else on the improvement of management.    This of course is general toall industry and much has already been done through the National economic development Council (NEDC) and Economic Development Committees (EDCs)to encourage better management practice and to disseminate knowledge of management techniques.    The need to strengthen management is now generally recognised as a problem and management education is increasing.Nevertheless, the application of new practices a.nd techniques has to becarried out in the peculiar circumstances of each individual firm.    I havebeen impressed by the valuable services which can be rendered through theemployment of management consultants.    Even where younger managers havereceived some training it is often difficult for them to apply in the environmentof their own firms measures which they know in theory to be right.    Theintroduction of outside consultants not only enables proper analyses of theproblems to be made, but shifts the responsibility for solutions on to an&quot;outside expert&quot;.    The psychological advantages of this are important.    Ibelieve there may be a case for a crash programme to provide the servicesof management consultants more widely.    I have in mind that we should offer to contribute to the costs of employing consultants to companies in selectedindustries; the condition of such help would be that the consultants&quot; reportswould be available to the Ministry as well as to the companies concerned.In conjunction with such a scheme we might consider the systematic use of television to show the basic principles together with an account of what hasbeen done in particular industrial situations - the identity of the cases would of course not be disclosed.    I proposed that we should discuss this idea, withthe Management consultants Association.    This itself would stimulate ademand for management services and also for the kind of advisory services provided by my Ministry.-2-
Advisory Services10.     The Ministry^ nine regional offices are now playing a constructivepart in the work of the Regional Economic Planning Boards and planning councils.    The staff are all technologically qualified and have been recruited to encourage industry to make more effective use of resources for technological advice   and assistance (including Research Establishments,Research Associations and NFJ3C).    In addition forty industrial liaison officers have been appointed and this number is to be increased to seventyby the end of the year.    These officers are generally based on technical colleges and their task is to make contacts with individual companies intheir localities and to put them in touch, either direct or through the regional Offices, with the services (including consultants) which can assist them with their technical problems.    Closely linked with this regional andlocal network is the Production Engineering Advisory Service which is being organised by the Production Engineering Research Association.    This will operate through a number of mobile units based on the regional offic es and pro-vide advice on production problems and demonstrations which can be broughtright into the factories and workshops.   My Departments direct expenditure onthese services whichis at presentiess than &amp;\ million a year, will need to be greatly expanded.   By comparison, the National Agricultural Advisory Servicecosts about  4f million for an industry only about a fifth of the size of engineering.Standards11.      Standards nationally or preferably interna.tionaliy agreed representthe codification of technology.    To the extent that they embody the besttechnology available and are generally used in production they can make avery large contribution to productivity through the elimination of non-standard products and the concentration of manufacturing resources onlarger production runs and also through the greater interchange ability of parts and components.    My Department now has general responsibility forthe British Standards Institution (331) whose work has always been verylargely in the engineering field.    The grant to the Institution has been increased to ena.ble it to recruit more staff.    In every way we areencouraging BSI to widen the range of British Standards, to reviseobsolescent standards and to accelerate the production of the new series ofBritish Metric Standards aligned with international and particularly with european standards.    Through the Research Stations and the research associations, we are represented on over 1, 000 BSI Committees.12.     We have set up a joint Committee with Management, Trades union and Government representatives to review and advise on measures toencourage the adoption of the metric system.    The advantages of a comprehensive range of metric and other standards aligned to international(international Standards Organisation) standards to our export trade arevery great indeed and the Governments initiative in this direction has been widely welcomed.    We have recently subscribed to the undertaking of theEuropean Free Trade Association (EFTA) Governments to push ahead withthe alignment of national standards to those internationally agreed which inpractice means adoption of European standards.    The European economic community (e.c.) countries are the pace-setters in this field and some80 per cent of international standards have been generated by thesecountries.    The EFTA undertaking includes the undertaking to useinternational standards in public procurement.
13.      We are supporting the work on standards by organising independentcalibration, testing, evaluation and certification services.    The BritishCalibration Service which has been set up in collaboration with the confederation of British Industries (CBI) provides industry with facilitiesfor calibrating measuring instruments and other test equipment againstnational and international standards so that accuracy can be authenticatedand certified.    A very large number of industrial and Governmentlaboratories are being brought into the Service as &quot;approved&quot; laboratoriesfor testing and calibration and for the issue of certificates on behalf of theService.    The instrument evaluation services of the Scientific InstrumentResearch Association and of the BSI itself are being extended.    We are alsodiscussing with industry the introduction of quality control and certificationschemes for castings and cables.    We believe that public procurementshould be used to support approved schemes of this type.Government Procurement14.     It is recognised that public procurement is potentially a powerfulinstrument for the encouragement of the application of advanced technology and for this reason my Ministry was given the task of seeing how thisinstrument could be used to better advantage.    The single most importantuse of Government procurement to stimulate productivity is the insistence on the use of British Standards and of internationally aligned standards wherethey exist.    All purchasing Departments are now co-operating in reviewingtheir purchasing policies from this point of view and I ca.n only say that Ibelieve progress is being made but that we still have a long way to go.Many Departments have traditionally developed their own special standards and product specifications differing from each other and from those used in industry or for exports and much still needs to be done to break down thisanarchy.    For example, last year the specifications of 233 items in hospital Equipment Notes issued by the Ministry of Health made no reference to the appropriate British Standards.    Neither Board of Tradenor Service life jackets are made to the British Standard.    Most screws andfasteners in Post Office equipment are non-standard.    Most paper used inGovernment is still non-standard.    Although there is a British Standard forlifts, it is widely ignored by Local Authorities.    In many fields, particularly those of interest to Defence Departments, there are as yet no british standards and these Departments can contribute to the generation of newstandards where they are badly needed.15.     The co-ordination of purchasing policies can be used in other waysto stimulate productivity.    We are already trying to co-ordinate Governmentand educational requirements for instruments with the aim of placing largerorders for types in wide use and so giving manufacturers the chance toorganise production for larger runs.    The activity can also help to reduceimports and to encourage the concentration of an industry which is fragmentedinto units too small to support adequate design, research and marketingservices.Structure of the Engineering Industries16.     The Ministry found as it began the study the problems of increasing productivity and efficiency in the engineering industries that in nearly every case the potential improvements were inhibited by the structure of theindustry.    Very early on the need for a body like the industrial reorganisation Corporation (1958-59) became evident.    In the sector of industry which more than any other large sector is competing in the world market-4-
and on which we depend to increase its share of that market, we need to concentrate resources into powerful units.    This applies particularly to industries heavily dependent on technology where the costs of adequateresearch, development and design are heavy and can only be supported by large scale production.    Equally, larger production units are necessary iffull advantage is to be taken of modern production techniques.    It is agreedthat the 1958-59 will give priority to the structural problems of the engineering industries and we are ready with a number of proposals for consideration.Electrical Machinery17.     This industry is being intensively studied by its EDC and all theevidence suggests that production is increasing only very slowly and thatthere are too many manufacturers of many items of plant such as motors,meters, transformers and switchgear as well as some domestic appliances.In this field there is room for greater standardisation and concentration.Electronics18.     We have given much attention to the rapidly expanding and changingcomponents sector of this industry.    Integrated circuits are replacingdiscrete components in many applications and we believe that the opportunityexists, given more effective deployment of research and developmentresources, to build an industry on British technology capable of competing with the Americans who at present have the lead in the production of these new circuits.    We are also examining the structure of the sector producingindustrial process measuring and control instruments which are the basisof automation systems.    Some rationalisation would probably be advantageous here and also closer links with the designers of the plant inwhich the systems are to be used.19.     Other industries which we think are priority candidates forreorganisation are contractors&apos; plant and mechanical handling equipment,machine tools and the chemical plant industries because of their vitalimportance for technological progress in other large industries.Computers20.     When the Ministry was founded it concentra-ted attention on computersfor two main reasons: the wider use of computers could make an enormouscontribution to raising productivity in almost every industry and there was an imminent danger that the British computer manufacturers would eithergo out of business or be taken over by American interests (as has happened in France).    This is the only field in which the Ministry can claim to have achieved already one of its main objectives.    ICT Ltd., owing to the,timely help we were able to provide through the NRDC has survived, and itslatest results show that both its production and its earnings have verysignificantly increased.    It is we believe gaining ground from its maincompetitor, IBM in the home market and in some foreign markets.21.     The production of computers for commercial data processing is nowconcentrated in the hands of two groups, ICT and English Electric-Leo-Marconi.    We believe that to strengthen our international position there isneed for a further merger of at least some of the activities of these two groups,    1958-59 may be able to help.
22.     We have now established and greatly strengthened the ComputerAdvisory Service within the Ministry.    This is now able to advise and assist all public sector computer users in addition to its traditional function of advising the Treasury on central government purchases.    We have alsolaid the foundations of the National Computing Centre which will providecomputer users throughout industry and Government with information aboutprogrammes already available and will sponsor the development of newgeneral programmes and reduce wasteful duplication of programmingresources.    The Centre will also provide and encourage training in systemsanalysis and programming techniques and will promote research.23.     Both directly and through NRDC we are supporting research anddevelopment of advanced computer techniques and the application of computers to industrial operations and processes and to engineering design.Automation24.     The greatest potential benefits to productivity are those to be derived from the application of automation to manufacturing processes.Automation is usually associated with the application of electronic techniques and more particularly with electronic computing, data recording andtransmission techniques.    The basic techniques exist and the problem isnot whefcer they can be applied, but the rate at which they can be introduced.We foresee an increasing demand for complete, automatically controlled and operated plants for export.    E we are to exploit this demand it is necessarythat we should be able to demonstrate automatic operation in our own industries.    For these two reasons (productivity of domestic industry and exports) it is necessary that we should increase the rate of progress.NRDC is already examining the number of major projects for industrialprocess control systems.    Contracts have been let to Elliott Automation Ltd,We are supporting the Industrial Automation Group of the ResearchAssociation to study the requirements for automation in their industries andfor the Scientific Instrument Research Association to develop the basisinstrumentation.    The Ministry is also organising a national campaignstyled &quot;Approaching Automation&quot; starting this Autumn to demonstrate thebenefits of &quot;low cost automation&quot; - i.e. relatively cheap devices which canbe used in conjunction with existing machines and processes to save labour,improve quality and reduce costs.25.     We do not regard &quot;saving the computer industry&quot; as an end in itselfbut as a central part of a policy to regain and hold the initiative fortechnological advance in industrial automation.    This will provide the focusfor many of our activities involving standardisation, engineering design,electronic techniques, our support for research and development and our, interests in training and education.Statistics26.     While it is too soon to expect the Ministry of Technology&apos;s new policies directed to increasing productivity and to applying new technology tochow up in industry-wide figures of output and exports, I am much troubled by the inadequacy of statistics on which to base accurate assessments of productivity and changes in productivity between one industry and another, and between partsof the same industry.  Net output per person employed is accepted as ausefulindicator of productivity, but comprehensive statistics of net output are atpresent provided only by the Censuses of Production.    The full results of-6-
the 1963 Census of Production (the latest taken) are not yet available andcalculations still have to be based on the 1958 Census.    Efforts are beingmade to remedy this situation through improvement in the short-termstatistics collected by my Ministry on a voluntary basis, but considerablework remains to be done before more sensitive indicators of the effects ofparticular policies on particular industries can be devised.27.     Differences in productivity as measured by net output per head are closely associated with differences in the amount of capital invested perworker and of course with the nature and quality of this investment.    In both1964 and 1965 investment was at a high rate.    It is too soon to measure theeffect of this investment on output and productivity.    Much, however, needs to be done to improve information on the quality of investment and the extentto which plant and machinery is replaced by new items of the same design,or by new types incorporating technological advances.28.     The best source of information on the productivity of capital andlabour taken together is provided by company accounts.    The proposals contained in the Companies Bill, introduced into the last Parliament, ondisclosure of information would make company reports and accounts a muchmore useful and important source of information on productivity a,nd the efficient deployment of resources.    In particular the requirement thatseparate information should be given about turnover from substantiallydiffering activities and about profit or loss on each would add substantially to information on industrial efficiency.    However, given the exigencies ofthe Parliamentary timetable it is unlikely that the proposed legislation canbear upon the production of company accounts for several years.    I suggestwe might consider whether an appeal could not be made now, possibly at theNational Productivity Conference, to companies voluntarily to draw up theiraccounts in the manner proposed in the Bill.&quot;v\-7-
