CONFIDENTIAL &quot;        2 96IS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66)13627th September, 1966CABINETDOCKS: RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES and draft OF GOVERNMENT STATEMENTMemorandum by the Minister of LabourAnnexed are the tv/o documents referred to in the First Secretary ofState&apos;s memorandum (C(66)135 paragraphs 7 and 11):(a) a note about Restrictive Practices in the Docks, prepared in collaboration with Lord Brown, the Chairman of the NationalModernisation Committee (Annex I).(b) a draft of the statement I propose to issue on the lines agreed by the Reorganisation of the Docks Committee (Annex II).I have, on consideration, not included any assurances on theposition of existing employees upon nationalisation;  I thinkthese can more conveniently be given separately, for example to the Chairman of the National Dock Labour Board (who hasraised the matter with me).2.       There is one particular matter to which I wish to draw my colleagues1attention.   As Annex I shows, restrictive practices in the docks fall into two categories.   The first consists of those associated with casual employment the second ts of other restrictive practices, for example, refusal to accept reductions in manning scales even when these are made possible by the introduction of new mechanised methods of working.3.       This classification into two categories was first made in the original1965 Devlin Report, which also recommended that negotiations for a newdeal in the docks should be undertaken in two stages.   The first of thesestages would include devising a new wage structure appropriate to thepermanent system of employment they proposed and, as part of the settlement,abolition of the restrictive practices associated with casual employment.Negotiations leading to the elimination of other restrictive practices would beincluded in the second stage.4.       So far only the first stage of negotiations has gone ahead.   The unions&apos;claim for higher pay and the employers&apos; counter-offer has been linked withthe elimination only of the restrictive practices associated with casualemployment;   and the recent Devlin Report on Pay, which in effect endorsesthe employers&apos; counter-offer, is similarly linked with the abolition ofthose particular practices.   We publicly accepted, of course, the principlesof the 1965 Devlin Report, and it would seem to follow that whateversettlement is now reached would in our view also be so linked.5.       We must, however, all recognise that the other restrictive practicescan be very damaging to efficiency.   (For example, they might includeopposition to the extension of roll on roll off loading).   I would, therefore,think it desirable to avoid specifying in the public statement that a settlement-1-CONFIDENTIALCOPY NO.    g 7
of the present stage is to be linked with the elimination of a particularcategory of restrictive practices only.    Hence the neutral form of wordsused in paragraph 5 of Annex II.6.       In my subsequent discussions with both sides of industry and theNational Modernisation Committee, I have it in mind that I will in factsee how far I can secure general agreement on the abolition in the context of the new pay settlement of all forms of working practices that are inimicalto efficient working of the docks.   We may find very strong opposition,particularly among the unions who will in any event be disappointed bothby the Devlin findings and with the delay in implementation imposed by theGovernment.   It will be argued, not without justification, that it has all along been envisaged that dockers will, in addition to the benefits to be derived from the recent Devlin Report, share the benefit of greater productivity achieved by more efficient working practices outside the context of the introduction of permanent employment.   The strong unofficialmovement in the docks might be able to cause a good deal of harm anddisruption against this background of dissatisfaction.   We will need toconsider our next steps when we have seen the reaction of the various interests and have the benefit also of any views expressed by theNational Modernisation Committee.7.       I seek my colleagues&apos; agreement to my putting out a statement onthe lines of Annex II.   I propose to do so on 3rd October.R.J.G.Ministry of Labour, S.W.I.27th September, 1966-2-
ANNEX I-r    298&quot;RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES&quot; IN THE DOCKSDiscussion at the Ministerial Committee on Re-organisation of the Dockson 23rd September agreed on the necessity of emphasising the need forextracting from the industry assurances on the elimination of specificrestrictive practices as a condition for i mplimentation of the Devlin wagerecommendations and the decasualisation which they will introduce.2.       It is not possible to make a specific statement which covers the whole industry because the nature of restrictive practices varies from port to port.   However, it is possible to specify a range of restrictive practicesone or more of which apply to all ports.   Broadly they fall into two categories.The first consists of those which are essentially a feature of the casualmethod of employment.(1)      Removal of restrictions on the transfer, during the loading and unloading of a ship, of labour from hatch to hatch, from ship to dock sideor from ship to ship.   These &quot;continuity rules&quot; have been necessary withcasual labour but decasualisation will make possible extensive modification.(2)      Removal of restrictions or unreasonable conditions attached toovertime working which is required to speed the turn round of ships,including(a) Refusal to work overtime on subsequent days unless overtime isworked on a ship&apos;s first day.(b) Refusal, when a week-end intervenes, to work overtime onsucceeding week days unless overtime is also called for on Saturdayand Sunday.(c) Requirement that no overtime shall be worked by any gangunless all gangs are ordered out.(d) Refusal to work overtime unless penal payments are made,e.g. the requirement that any work done after 5 p.m. must carry with it the payment of a minimum of four hours&apos; overtime pay.(3)      Elimination of practices in Liverpool and Glasgow whereby a rotatingpercentage of the men are absent from work throughout the day.(4)      Removal of restriction on mobility of labour from job to job onquayside and warehouse work.The employers&apos; offer and the Devlin recommendation which in effectendorse that offer is linked with the establishment of permanent employment and therefore with the abolition of these practices listed at(1) to (4) above.    The National Modernisation Committee has asked thelocal Modernisation Committees in the ports to identify the practicesconcerned so that agreements for eliminating them may be negotiated tocome into force concurrently with the new pay structures.   The national committee will keep a close watch on the progress made by the localCommittees, and be guided by this in making arrangements for theintroduction nationally of the new pay structure.-3-
3.       In addition there are other restrictive practices.   These includerestrictions on the introduction of reduced manning scales made possible by the introduction of new methods.   For example, packaged in place ofloose timber cargoes, roll on roll off loading, and other forms of increased mechanisation.   The elimination of these was not specificallyenvisaged in Lord Devlin&apos;s report on pay as part of the present settlement.\ V-4-
ANNEX ii draft GOVERNMENT STATEMENT ON PUBLICATION OFDEVLIN AND HONEYMAN REPORTSIntroductionMuch preparatory work has to be done before the Government can draw up legislation for nationalisation of the docks, which on their present planswould be introduced in the 1968/69 session and come into operation in 1970.Decasualisation2.       Meantime it is essential in the Government&apos;s view to press ahead asa matter of urgency with the plans based on the 1965 Devlin report for bringing a fully decasualised system of working into operation in the docks.This will make an important contribution to the modernisation and efficiency of the industry and will bring substantial benefits to dock workers.Much of the preparatory work for this has already been done by the industry&apos;national Modernisation Committee under Lord Brown&apos;s chairmanship andby the Docks and Harbours Act, which received the Royal Assent in AiUgust.3.       The report of Lord Devlin&apos;s Committee on Docks Pay andSir George Honeyman&apos;s report on objections to the draft revised Dock labour scheme which are being published today, are two further essential steps in preparing for the introduction of full decasualisation.Honeyman report.       The Government accept the recommendations in Sir George Honeyman&apos;sreport.   The report endorses, subject to certain changes, the main provisions of the draft revised Dock Labour Scheme which, while preserving the main principles of the present Scheme, will incorporate changesconsequential upon the introduction of a system of permanent instead oflargely casual employment.   The report raises some detailed points which require further examination in consultation with the industry.   Subject tothis, it is proposed to include provisions giving effect to the recommenda-tions of the report in an Order, which will be made at the appropriate time,to bring the new Dock Labour Scheme into effect.Devlin report5.       The Government endorse in principle the pay changes recommended in Lord Devlin&apos;s report and recognise that their implementation is directlyrelevant to the successful introduction of a fully decasualised system ofworking.   They are anxious to co-operate as fully as possible with theindustry in achieving this.   It is no less essential that steps should be takento ensure that restrictive practices which have, hitherto impeded the efficient working of the docks are eliminated.   In the Government&apos;s view implement a-tion of the pay changes recommended in the Devlin report must be conditional upon specific agreement for the elimination of restrictive working practices.The timetable for implementation of these changes must of course also be governed by the provisions of the prices and incomes standstill and by the criteria which still have to be settled for pay increases during the period-5-

The Minister of Labour is inviting the chairman and independent members of the industry&apos;s National Modernisation Committeeand representatives of managements and workers on the Committee todiscuss these matters with him.Estuarial reorganisation schemes6.      The Government also reaffirm their intention to proceed during theperiod before nationalisation with schemes for the unification of ports in the main estuaries as outlined in the White Paper on Transport Policy(Cmnd. 3057, paragraph 112).e-6r
