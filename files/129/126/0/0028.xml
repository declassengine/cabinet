S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 126  - COPY NO,9th September&quot;, 1966CABINETRHODESIA AND THE commonwealth prime MINISTERS&apos; MEETINGMemorandtxm by the Secretary of State for commonwealth affairs as expected, we have had a very rough time at the commonwealth meeting.     We have had good support from all the old Commonwealth andfrom Malaysia.    Otherwise, virtually all Commonwealth Heads of delegations have pressed us, with varying degrees of vehemence -(a) to use military forcej(b) to declare that there would be no independence before majority rule, and(c) to propose mandatory sanctionsUnless we can give some satisfaction, there is a risk of some Membersleaving the Commonwealth - but graver than that there would be a blow to confidence in the Commonwealth association which could have seriouslasting results.    It is important to prevent this if we can,2.     (a)     We have made it clear that force is out of the question,and the old Commonwealth, including Canada, havegiven us strong support.    I do not think that they arelikely to press this, certainly not if they can be met on other points.(b)     No independence before majority rule.    We cannotconcede this since it would be contrary to all our previous undertakings in Parliament and would be interpreted by the Europeans in Rhodesia as a demandfor unconditional surrender.    The effect could thereforeonly be to lengthen the struggle.     But there is some misunderstanding and confusion about the fifth principle,and we could clarify this in a way which might go somedistance towards satisfying our present critics.-1-
(c)     Mandatory sanctions.    There would be no difficulty about accepting mandatory sanctions on exports of selected raw materials, but by themselves they wouldnot be enough and there is bound to be strong pressure for some action on oil.    The question is, having regardto the risk of escalation leading to economic war with south Africa, whether we could agree to oil sanctionsin any form, and, if so, whether they should be -(a) in general terms(b) limited to Mozambique(c) introduced now or delayed until, say, the1st December.3.      If we could get  general Commonwealth agreement to our makinga final effort to bring the rebellion to an end, there is a chance that we might get them to stay their hand until, say, the 1st December (whenthe United Nations Assembly will still be in session) provided we under-take that, if the rebellion has not ended by then, we would be preparedto agree to mandatory sanctions,4.     The outline of a possible British statement to the conference is attached.H. B.Commonwealth Office, S, W. 1.9th September, 1966-2-
BRITISH STATEMENT TO THE conference.      The British Government are determined to bring the illegal regime in Rhodesia to an end at the earliest possible moment.2.      They propose that, on the ending of the rebellion, the governor should form a broad-based Government representative of all races in rhodesia^ and that the armed forces and police would be responsible to the G-governor.3.      After the return to legality and the establishment of a constitutional government, the British Government would intend to devise by negotiation a constitution which would be submitted to the rhodesian people as a whole for their acceptance.4.     The meaning of the Fifth Principle is that independence will begranted to Rhodesia only by the clear consent of the people of rhodesia  a whole and will not be imposed upon them without their consent.In this sense the people of Rhodesia as a whole will have the right ofself-determination in relation to the timing of independence.    Theviews of the people as a whole are to be ascertained in a fair and proper test.    This is fundamental to the purpose of the Fifth Principle.The British Government are determined to ensure that this is a fairtest and would only be prepared to accept the result if they themselves are fully satisfied about the fairness of the test.      One question wouldbe how Commonwealth members could be associated with the test.     Inany case, the British Government would wish to continue the fullestconsultations with all Members of the Commonwealth on all thesematters.5.      The British Government propose to acquaint the Governor ofthese propositions and to arrange for consultations to be held with all sections of opinion in Rhodesia,,    If by the 1st December, 1966, theBritish Governments proposals are not accepted and the illegal regimefail to indicate their willingness to hand over power to a broadly-basedGovernment responsible to the Governor, the British Government willbe prepared to agree to appropriate mandatory sanctions under chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, seeking the approval of theSecurity Council for -(a) sanctions against selected Rhodesian exports;(b) sanctions against the import of oil into Rhodesia.6.      The British Government will insist that any new constitutionacceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole must be in conformitywith the six principles, with safeguards to ensure that they arerespected.
