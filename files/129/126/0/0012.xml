W. 1.18th July, 1966
Discriminatory measures to increase exportsNote by the D.E.A.We were asked to consider the possibility of introducing,,special measures to increase exports quickly.    The most effectivemethods are those which increase the profitability of exports ata time when deflationary measures should be making furthercapacity available for export.2.     In the exhaustive examination of export incentives over thelast year and a half we have stopped short of recommending directexport subsidies for fear of international retaliation.    The extentof discrimination so far has been the subsidising of manufacturing industry, as the major provider of our exports, through the investment grants scheme and the selective employment tax..   We havetonsidered three possible ways in which the Government could,subsidise exports more directly,(a) Direct export subsidy3.     The simplest way would be to replace the existing exportrebate of 2-g- per cent by a 10 per cent subsidy.   With deflationat home this should be effective and, once introduced,  quick workingBut legislation would be needed to authorise such payments anda direct subsidy would be the most explicit breach of all our international obligations.    It would bring quick and damagingretaliation.(b) Charging a lower rate of Corporation Tax on exports.k.     Companies would be relieved of corporation tax in proportion to their, export turnover.    This would amount to a&apos;straight exportsubsidy.    It would be open to the same objections as (a) above,yet be less direct and therefore probably less effective, moredifficult to arrange and more complicated to administer.   The
arrangements would have to he incorporated in a Finance Bill.(c)    Inducements to individual exporters5.     A third method of making exporting more profitable could he to provide special financial or other assistance - notrelated in amount directly to their exports - to good exporters.Industry would he opposed to any scheme discriminating in favourof individual companies and if one were brought in (or hinted at)without prior consultation, Government/industry relations wouldbe gravely damaged.   And if a scheme involving,  for example,preferential tax treatment for particular companies, were announced as part of a package designed to save the pound,  itwould be regarded here and abroad as a stratagem of desperation.It seems certain that, so far from strengthening confidence inthe Government&apos; s ability to maintain the parity,  it would weakenit,    (This is not to say that there may not be useful scope for the Government to negotiate,  with individual companies to see whether it can exercise its controls and incentives e.g, industrialdevelopment certificates,  training,etc.,  in order to persuade them to increase their exports.    This will be followed up, butit needs careful working out and the effect on exports is boundto be gradual.)Cheap credit for exporters6.     Of the various possibilities v/e have examined the only onewhere there seems to be any prospect at all of working out apractical scheme is the provision of cheap credit to exporters.This is already done on a limited scale here and more widelyabroad.   With the increase in interest rates such a scheme wouldbe more valuable.- 2 -     ^ ^ v
7,     The simplest arrangement would he to extend to short termexport credits the low rate of interest (5i&quot; per cent) now available on export credits of two years or more.    This wouldinvolve a direct Government subsidy to the banks if they couldnot be prevailed upon to absorb the cost themselves (as theydo under the present scheme).   We might be accused in doing this of breaching   internationl obligations and it would almost certainly fall foul of E.F.T.A.:    but other countries, notablyPrance, do something similar and we might get away with itoutside E.F.T.A.    However,  the total value   to exporters of ascheme of this kind would probably be less than  10 million ayear,  so its effects on exports would be marginal.8.       A more substantial measure would be to reduce the cost ofoverdrafts used to finance production for export.    This toowould be an export subsidy proscribed by G.A.T.T.and E.P.T.A.for which, however, there is so far as we know/, no internationalprecedent.    It would require legislation,  it would be difficultto administer and very difficult to ensure that the creditis used for exports.   Large scale abuse of the scheme would undermine the credit squeeze..     On the other hand,  if somepracticable and internationally acceptable arrangements couldbe devised this scheme could have a significant impact,ffjoncjlu si on9.     None of these measures would be suitable for announcement in this week&apos;s &quot;package&quot;.   A direct export subsidy,  a lower rateof corporation tax on exports and financial discrimination infavour of good exporters are unacceptable internationally andwould weaken confidence.    There may be scope for reducing the- 3 -
cost of credit to exporters and for negotiating with individual firms to get them to increase their exports.    These last two possibilities are being examined.    It is not yet clear that any practical schemes can be worked out and until this is established,  they should not be mentioned as possibilities.Department of Economic Affairs.18th July, 1966- h -w
