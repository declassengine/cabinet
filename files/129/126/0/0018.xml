DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 118 COPY NO.  6719th July, 1966CABINETBLACK ARROWNote by the Minister of aviation attach a report from the Chairman of the Official Committeeon Technology inviting Ministers to decide whether the Black arrow programme for the development of a small launcher and the associated series of satellites shall continue..2.     In the space field national self-sufficiency at all levels is outof the question; but, in order to equip itself to play a part in inter-national space activity, whether of a scientific or a commercialcharacter and to evaluate developments in this field the United Kingdommust clearly maintain some expertise and capability.3.     Apart from our international co-operative ventures our spaceeffort, apart from Black Arrow, is limited to a modest programmelargely financed by the Science Research Council of firing soundingrockets.    While this programme has achieved excellent results itdoes not provide the launcher necessary to test satellite componentsin space during their development.    Unless we proceed with the black arrow launcher we shall have to buy launchers from the United states for this purpose.    This, for the reasons stated in the attached paper,would be unsatisfactory technologically.4.      The development of the Black Aa;row launcher itself is estimated to cost  9i million of which  1^ million has already been spent and the commitment of a further  600,000 authorised up to 30th September.The balance of the programme is for satellite development.    While itmight be possible to obtain the actual launcher from elsewhere, Iconsider the development of adequate satellite technology in the UnitedKingdom to be essential.    This is a rapidly expanding field and onelikely to grow in importance,    commercially as well as for ourtechnology,5,     The most effective way of enabling us to develop our space,and more particularly our satellite, technology is in my view toproceed with the Black Arrow programme.    But I recognise that inthe present grave economic situation it may be difficult to endorse a programme which entails expenditure of the order proposed in the next two years.-1-
6.     In these circumstances, I hope colleagues can agree, in viewof the importance of maintaining and developing our technologicalcapacity in this field, that officials shotild be asked to explore urgentlythe possibility of devising a more modest means of keeping the teamsin being and so enabling us to keep abreast of satellite technology.    Inthis connection I think we need to consider the Black Arrow programmetogether with the proposals which have been made for the co-operativedevelopment of an experimental communications satellite on a Europeanbasis in the European Conference on Telecommunications Satellites(CETS) which, if approved, will involve the United Kingdom, on a basisof 25 per cent of the cost, in expenditure of   1. 5 million a year for thenext 4 years.    A Ministerial conference to decide on CETS is planned for October and we shall be invited to decide on the policy to be followedby the United Kingdom in the next few weeks.7.     I hope, therefore, colleagues can agree to consider, if need be, a revised programme at the same time as we decide on our policy towards CETS.F.M.IMinistry of Aviation, S. W. 1.18th July, 1966
CONFIDENTIALBLACK ARROWMote by the Chairman of the Official Committeeon TechnologyIn December, 1965, when the Cabinet decided that we should work towards terminating our commitment to the European launcher development Organisation (ELDO),  Ministers were disposed to approve the BLACK ARROW programme (the Chief Secretary, Treasuryreserving his position).    Now that, on the basis of a substantialrevision both of the technical aspects of the ELDO programme and ofthe United Kingdom financial contribution to it, the Cabinet hasdecided that we should continue to participate, the question whether weshould complete the development of BLACK ARROW calls for furtherconsideration,2.     The newly proposed ELDO-PAS launcher is a heavy launchercapable of putting a weight of 15 0 kilogrammes into a geo-stationaryorbit of 35,700 kilometres from an equatorial launching site.    black arrow will be capable of putting 100 kilogrammes into a polar orbit of550 kilometres from Woomera,    Our decision to participate in ELDOis not based to any significant extent on the technological interests ofthe programme to the United Kingdom, nor on its economic prospects,but on the desirability of the United Kingdom maintaining an interest inthe development of heavy launchers, because of possible future uses,and on political considerations arising from our relations with europe and the United States.3.     Such participation does not provide of itself for the maintenance and development by the United Kingdom of the techniques associatedwith space activities.    To enable us to maintain our technologicalposition in this field vis-a-vis such industrial powers as France and japan (we cannot hope to compete with the United States and the soviet union) a complementary national space programme is necessary.    our interest is primarily in satellite technology which is a rapidlydeveloping subject and is likely to grow in importance.    To testsatellite components and sub-assemblies under actual space conditions we need a launcher.4.     The ELDO-A launcher is not competitive for this purpose: itis much too large and too powerful a vehicle for testing components and sub-assemblies j the cost of an ELDO-A launching would be morethan six times that of BLACK ARROW; and its use in this role vouldtherefore be quite uneconomic.    The present French DIAMANT wouldbe too small and the only other alternative to BLACK ARROW would beto buy SCOUT launchers from the United States,    This would not,however, be technologically satisfactory, primarily because the volumeavailable for experimental purposes which can be launched by theSCOUT is less than half that of BLACK ARROW.    The Japanese aredeveloping a launcher comparable with SCOUT and subject to the samelimitations.    Furthermore it is not known when development will becompleted, although we understand that the first test launching is planned to take place towards the end of this year.    Quite apart,therefore, from the possible disadvantages which might come from our-3-
abandoning launcher techniques, BLACK ARROW (which is based onthe fully proved BLACK KNIGHT) is the only really satisfactorylauncher for the purpose in paragraph 3.    The programme for its development and for the continued research into basic satellitetechnology have been planned as a single integrated and self-containedproject.    The purpose of the launcher will be to provide UnitedKingdom industry and United Kingdom technologists with a research and development facility which would on the one hand enable us to carryout in actual space conditions the experiments that are necessary to test the performance of satellites and satellite components and on theother hand, to gain direct experience of the problems of injectingsatellites into prescribed orbits and controlling them.5.     In addition, a review of the technological possibilities has shownthat the retention of a national programme of this nature could well lead,at very moderate cost, to quite new developments which might, forexample, greatly increase the performance both of BLACK ARROWitself and ultimately of larger, launchers like ELDO-A.    One interest-ing possibility which is opening up is the use of electrical propulsionsystems to alter the nature of a satellite orbit after the satellite hasbeen launched - a possibility which would enable higher orbits (for commercial and other purposes) to be obtained with much smallerlaunchers than are needed at present vising conventional methods.6.     The estimated total cost of the BLACK ARROW programme forthe period April 1966 - March 1975 is  43,7 million.    When Ministerspreviously considered BLACK ARROW they were concerned only withthe civil expenditure represented by the extramural element, 32, 1 million included in this total because it was assumed (a) thatcosts of work done in Ministry of Aviation establishments would be met from the Defence Budget and (b) that the costs of launchings atWoornera would be shared between the Defence Budget and theAustralian Government.    As the attached Annex shows, this as sumptionis no longer valid, and therefore the costs of (a) and (b) which total 11, 6 million over the period 1966-75 would fall to be regarded as additional civil expenditure.    This additional charge is one reason forreconsidering the BLACK ARROW programme.    A recent review has confirmed the total figure of  9. 5 million for the development of thelaunch vehicle and the ultimate rate of extramural expenditure in the utilisation phase of  4 million a year for three launchings.    However,it was found that the cost of developing satellites for the utilisationphase would be higher than had previously been expected (because moresophisticated experiments are now envisaged), and the build-up of the utilisation phase has therefore been retarded in order to keep within theoriginal annual and ten year ceilings.    The annual rate of threelaunchings a year would therefore not be reached until 1972-73 and themaximum number of satellites launched in the utilisation phase wouldbe 13 rather than 17.    This slowing down would not significantlyaffect the technological benefits to be derived from the programme.-4-GO N FIDE NTS AL
m     1457.     The case for continuing with the BLACK ARROW programme is that it enables us to maintain a sufficient national programme inspace technology, to permit us to play an appropriate part in future international developments and to take up, either alone or inco-operation with other countries, any option which might appearprofitable or advantageous in a field in which the potentialities are quite unknown, but may be of considerable importance to us.Without such a programme we cannot expect to play a significant partin space either now or in the future, national or international, and wemay be cutting ourselves off from other advanced technologies.    Thecase against BLACK ARROW is that these admittedly hypotheticalbenefits and the absence of present economic justification for the black ARROW programme (the sales of space components whichmight be developed would not warrant the R and D investment) do not justify the cost involved, particularly now that some  6 million a year on average has had to be added back to the costs of the Ministry of aviation space programme to cover EITOO.8.     The question for Ministers is whether or not in the light ofthese conflicting circumstances we should continue with BLACK arrow programme.
annex .     In the original costings for the BLACK ARROW programme itwas noted that the intramural costs, which are now assessed at 1. 2 million per annum, had hitherto been borne on the defence budget.    Nothing was included for the costs of the launchings fromWoomera, which it was assumed would be carried on the Joint Projectexpenditure which is shared between the United Kingdom and Australia.The total costs to the Joint Project have been tentatively estimatedat  200,000 on capital facilities and  100,000 per launching onidentifiable operating costs (of which only half would be additional coststhroughout the programme).    Under the present Joint Projectfinancial arrangements the United Kingdom bears  45. 6 per cent of joint Project expenditure as a charge against the Defence Budget butthe terms of the agreement will have to be renegotiated shortly as itexpires on the 30th June, 1967.2.      The Secretary of State for Defence has informed the Ministerof Aviation that he does not consider that the defence interest in this programme is sufficient to justify continuing to bear the intramuralcosts and the costs at Woomera on his Defence Budget.    In thesecir exam stances it is an open question whether the Australians will accept launchings of BLACK ARROW under Joint Project arrangements.3.      The Secretary of State for Defence has suggested that if itwould help vis-a-vis the discussions with the Australians it v/ould beperhaps possible for a notional addition to be made to the defence budget to cover these additional extra costs of BLACK ARROWprovided it was understood that the defence ceiling would be raisedby the cost, whatever it may prove to be, in any particular year.But as it is clear that he is not prepared to find these costs from withinthe ceiling of the defence budget and since there is no provision forthem in the programmes of any other Department they would representa net addition to public expenditure unless any other Department wereprepared to give up a corresponding share of its currently approvedprogramme.    This addition would, over the period 1966-75, amountto  9. 6 million on intramural costs and  2 million for Woomera costs.Both these amounts are included in the total cost of the wholeprogramme,  43. 7 million, given in paragraph 6 of the main paper.-6-
