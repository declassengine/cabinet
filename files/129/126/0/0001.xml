C(66) 101 COPY NO.8th July, 1966CABINETEXPORTS AND IMPORT SUBSTITUTIONMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIntroductionOver the past decade, exports have grown by about 3 per cent ayear in volume and imports by 4-jr per cent.    But exports prices have risen markedly in relation to import prices, and, while in the mid-1950s exports paid for something less than 90 per cent of our imports,in 1965 the proportion had risen to 95 per cent.    (Before the war it wasonly two-thirds).    In the last two years, however, with the rise in world commodity prices the terms of trade have moved against us, and though there may be changes from year to year we cannot count on a return to the favourable trend of the fifties.    At the same time thedemand for imports, particularly of manufactured goods, has remainedstrong, despite the restraining effect of the temporary import chargewhich will be removed in November.    For these reasons it seems unlikely that the growth of exports will be such as to pay for an increasing proportion of our import requirements.Import Saving2.     A contribution can be made to the solution of the problempresented by this situation through saving imports by competitivemanufacture in this country.3.     Where there are Economic Development Committees (EBCs) for individual industries, work on import saving has in the first place beenchannelled through them.    The EDCs have so far concentrated in this field on identifying the possibilities for competitive manufacture in theUnited Kingdom and on bringing users and makers together to facilitate the exploitation of these possibilities.    This approach has been carriedfurthest in the engineering (particularly the mechanical engineering)field,    Contacts have been established, for example, between the makersand users of chemical plant (the domestic shortage of manufacturing capacity in this field has been one of the main reasons for the increasein imports of chemicals).    Similar discussions are also going on inconnection with chocolate machinery, paper-making machinery, wooltextiles and electrical equipment.-1-THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)
q4.     Outside the field covered by the EDCs, in raw materials there isnot a great deal of scope for import saving, though North Sea natural gasmay prove to be a notable exception.    There may also be some scope for  saving through the greater reclamation of scrap, e. g. paper andrubber.     Our imports of timber and pulp cost us some  360 millionlast year and we could grow more at home, but any savings from thiswould be very slow to accrue.    An Official Committee reported at theend of last year that a general increase in the domestic planting programme was not justifiable because of the relatively low return itwould produce, but Norwegian experience suggests that this conclusionmay need to be reviewed.5.     In the case of cameras, for example, prolonged attempts toestablish a viable British industry have been largely unsuccessful, andattempts to establish a watch industry have been successful only for the cheaper type of product.    The reorganisation of cotton textile production which the Government have stimulated has already produced a strongerand more competitive industry but there is still a long way to go, and imports from low cost producers are being restricted by quotas until1970.6.     &quot;Work on import saving will be pressed forward through the EDCsand directly by the Government, but most of it will take time to showresults.    And so long as our exports are being held back, as I believethey are, by pressure of demand at home, we must be careful thatencouragement to manufacture for the home market does not reduce our ability to maintain and expand our exports.Exports7.      Our recent export performance has been encouraging (see Annexfor details).    Last year our exports were 7 per cent greater in value than in 1964, and in the first five months of this year they were5j per cent greater than in 1965, though the rate of increase seems to beflattening.    But the prospects for world trade are not unfavourable, andwe think that it should be possible to maintain an increase of not far short of 7 per cent this year and next, provided that deraand in our principal markets remains as buoyant as at present seems likely.Nevertheless our share of world trade in manufactures continues to fall,and this is only partly because some of our principal industrialcompetitors are growing in population a.nd economic strength more rapidly than we are.8.     Exports to North America, and particularly to the United States,accounted for nearly one-third of the total rise in United Kingdom exportslast year, but the rate of growth has dropped back recently.    In the sterling Area too exports did well last year, but here again in recent months there has been some weakness in shipments to South africa and Australia whoseeconomies are under pressure.    Our exports arebenefitting from the recovery in France and Italy while exports to european Free Trade Association countries and to other markets in western Europe are continuing to show strong growth.-2- s/
9.     World demand for engineering products has been at a high levelover the past decade and the adaptability of United Kingdom exporters is reflected in the fact that the proportion of our exports accounted for byengineering products has risen from 37 per cent in 1954 to over 44 percent last year.    In this important field price is often not the vitaldeterminant.    Quality and delivery are at least as important.10.     In assessing the outlook for exports the main factor is that we expect continued buoyant demand from the United States.    In Europe the recovery in France and Italy, and the German Off-Set Agreement should help.    Sterling Area demand should remain satisfactory.11.     Given that v/e can reasonably expect overseas demand to remainbuoyant for the next year or two, and that our exports have been doingwell, what further steps can we take to ensure that the oppertuinities which exist for doing even better are fully exploited ?    The mostimportant and that which will yield the quickest results is to enablethose firms which are already in the export business to take orders which they have to turn away because of lack of capacity or skilled labour,or lose because their delivery dates are too long.    This means continuedrestraint on the pressure of home demand.    Without this, all other measures will remain ineffective, because the goods for export willsimply not be there.12.     In the past eighteen months, as my colleagues know, a successionof measures has been announced for helping exporters in a great variety of ways.    The British National Export Council and its area committees have been built up and are working actively to encourage exports to all areas of the world, using the methods which seem best suited to the markets with which each is concerned.    The Board of Trade&apos;s ownexpenditure on support for trade fairs, inward and outward missions,co-operative market research and similar ventures has more than doubled in the last two years.    Substantial improvements have beenmade in the terms offered by the Export Credits Guarantee department and their premiums have been reduced.    The export rebate has provided welcome assistance.    An Overseas Engineering ServicesBureau has been set up with Government support to help ourconsultants to gain business abroad.    We have arranged major exportpromotion exercises involving visits to hundreds of firms by overseasCommercial Officers to acquaint them, in detail with exportopportunities in the USA, Australia and Canada, and one is now inprogress for Germany.    The whole field of education for export isunder review, and research is being undertaken into the practice of firms in costing sales for export.    Some of this work has already shownresults: much of it will only bear fruit in the coming months and years.Other projects are being examined, in particular forms of organisation for facilitating exports by smaller firms and those without exportexperience,13.     We intend to press on with these and other measures, improvingand extending them in the light of experience, and continuing the search for new ways of helping existing exporters and encouraging new ones.    But v/e shall always depend for the major part of any increase on a few hundred firms of established exporters, and our main effort must be directed to creating conditions in which they can do still more.
Summary of Conclusions14.     The conclusions of this paper may be summarised as f ollowa;-(a) The performance of our exports since the beginning of 1965has been good and the prospects for the next 18 months are that it will continue so.(b) The turning against us of the terms of trade will, however,mean that the rise in value of our exports will hardlyeven keep pace with imports.(c) Development of home manufacture to replace imports can make a useful contribution to dealing with this situation, but willnot produce quick results.    Work on this is proceeding mainlythrough the EDCs (paragraphs 3-6).(d) There is room for further improvement in exports.    The mainlimiting factor at present is lack of available goods due to the pressure on productive capacity and skilled labour, rather thanuncompetitive prices or poor salesmanship.(e) The essential condition for a greater increase of exports in theimmediate future is therefore adequate control of home demand.This would also help, perhaps more quickly, by reducingimports.(f) A large number of measures are being taken to help exportersand to improve the Government^ services to them. These arealready showing some results and should in time achieve more,(paragraphs 12-13).D. P. T. J.&apos;    Board of Trade, S. W. 1.8th July, 1966-4-
