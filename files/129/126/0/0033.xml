C(66)13326th September, 1966COPY NO.6CABINETIRON AND STEEL, NATIONALISATION:  SALARIES OFIviEMBEPvS OF THE corporation memorandum by the Minister of power propose shortly to appoint an Organising Committee to prepare the ground for the National Steel Corporation.     The Chairman o  theCommittee, Lord Melchett, will be the Chairman Designate of theCorporation.     Other members of the Committee, including the deputy chairman (Mr. Macdiarmid of Stewarts and Lloyds) will be servingpart-time, usually without payment and without commitment on either side for them to join the Corporation once it is formed.    I shall,however, be appointing one or more members of the Committee who,like the Chairman, will be full-time members-designate of theCorporation - Mr. Ron Smith of the Union of Post Office Workers hasalready agreed to serve and will be remunerated for his services fromnext January,2.       The only immediate question on remuneration is that of theChairman, Lord Melchett.    Lord Melchett, who is a Managing Directorof Hill, Samuel, now gets about  20, 000 a year in all, but has volunteeredto take a cut of  4, 000 a year, on the understanding that his pensionposition is preserved.     We have had great difficulty in getting fee rightman for this job and after discussion with the First Secretary and theChancellor of the Exchequer, I recommend acceptance on this basis.3.       Lord Melchett however feels strongly that, in order not to be widely out of line with the salary levels within the steel industry,members of the Corporation should not be restricted to the salarybands which at present apply in the nationalised field.    He has told methat he v/ill continue to press the importance of fixing the remuneration of the Corporation on a basis which will be conducive to a strong and efficient steel industry, and will not cause an exodus of good staff.    i recognise of course that there are also strong considerations of incomes policy;  but we do not have to make final decisions until we reach the stage of completing the appointments of the Corporation and we know whothe people are and what they will come for.    Meanwhile, I would holdout no hopes to Lord Melchett, telling him we shall keep in mind the considerations which he urges but that there are other factors, includingincomes policy, which must bear on decisions in this field.-1-\DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
4.       I invite ray colleagues to agree that:-(i)  I should offer Lord Melchett, as Chairman of the organising committee and later of the National Steel Corporation,   16,000 a year.(ii) Any other immediate cases of remuneration should be dealt withad hoc through the usual machinery of interdepartmental consultation,subject as necessary to clearance with the First Secretary and theChancellor of the Exchequer.(iii) We should settle the salary scales for the Corporation later when we have a clearer idea of the appointments to be made.R. W. I/a.&apos;Ministry of Power, S. W. 1.23rd September, 1966-2-CONFIDENTIAL
