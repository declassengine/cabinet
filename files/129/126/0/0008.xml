THE REGULATORNote Jby the Treasury and CustomsThe Regulator power.     The power to impose the Regulator &quot;if it appears to theTreasury that it is expedient, with a view to regulating the&apos;balance betweendemand and resources in the United Kingdom&quot;was originally given in Section 9 of the Finance Act, 1961.Since then, the po?/er has been renewed, in Finance Bills atannual intervals.2.     The Regulator power extends to all of the Customs and excise Revenue duties (other than licence duties) and thePurchase Tax,    In 1964, greater flexibility was introduced by subdividing the duties into five groups -(b) Spirits, beer and wine(c) Hydrocarbon oil(d) Purchase Tax(e) Other duties, principally those on betting,matches and mechanical lighters.Under Section 8 of the 1964 Act, either a surcharge or a rebate(but not both) may be applied selectively, at different rates upto a maximum of 10 per cent., to any one or more of these groups.But each group must be treated as a whole, i.e. it is notpossible to raise just one of the rates of purchase tax.Yield of a 10 per cent. Surcharge3.     The yield of a full 10 per cent, surcharge on the respectivegroups on a full year basis is shown in the following table.Figures are shown both gross and net:    the net figures allow for the effect of the hire purchase proposals now before ministers and for the additional export rebate which willbecome payable following the increases in the oil duty and purchase tax.(aTobaccoGross NetGroup (a) TobaccoGroup (b) Alcoholic  million   millionUncertain (see para. 7 below)Group (c) OilGroup (d) Purchase TaxGroup (e) Betting andother minordutiesdrink/Effect

OfTohacco7.     The duty on tobacco was substantially increased in both the196h (Spring) and the 1965 Budgets.   Following these dutyincreases the consumption of tobacco (in quantity terms) has fallen but demand is so delicately poised that it is difficultto know what the effect on revenue of a further increase would be;any increase would be unlikely to exceed  25 million and might be considerably less and even the possibility of no additional revenueat all cannot be ruled out.   To impose a Regulator surcharge atthis stage might have an altogether disproportionate effect on demand and so on the future yield of the tobacco duty.   This isnot the purpose of the Regulator and it is recommended that group (a) be not included.Betting and Other Minor Duties8.       The yield of a 10 per cent, surcharge on this, group is small - only some  h million a year.    Moreover the new generalbetting duty will fall within the group and a surcharge couldcomplicate its introduction and perhaps even prejudice its success.    It is recommended therefore that group (e) also benot included./9.   the top snecamr
The Regulator and the Jiixport Rebate9o     Broadly speaking the export rebate counteracts the effecton export costs of the otherwise unrelieved elements of indirect taxation due to the oil duties, the purchase tax and the vehiclelicence duties.    If the surcharge remains in force for any length of time the question will arise of increasing the ratesof export rebate to compensate for it.    It will of course takea little time for the additional duty to work its way fullythrough into the cost of goods beingexported but it is estimatedthat the additional export rebate payable following 10 per cent,surcharges on the oil duties and purchase tax would ultimatelyreach  7 million a year.recommend at ion10.     It is recommended by officials that a surcharge of 1,0 percent, be applied to groups (b), (c) and (d), that is to theduties on alcoholic drinks and oil and to purchase tax.    It willyield  175 million gross ( 148 million net) in a full year.    Itwould be possible to make an Order to bring this surcharge intooperation at midnight Wednesday 20th/Thursday 21st July providedthat a decision were taken and communicated to Customs by the evening of Tuesday, 19th July, or in the last resort by noon onWednesday, 20th July.   Any announcement in the House should bemade not earlier than 3.30 p.m, in order t o limit forestalling    &apos;&apos;before the Order takes effect.    The Order would require to be confirmed by Resolution of the House of Commons within 21 calendardays.18th July, 1966Treasury Chambers, &quot;LONDON, S.W.1 .
