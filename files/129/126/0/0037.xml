PART IV OF THE PRICES AND INCOMES ACTLegal Actions against Employers for Breach of ContractThe Association of Supervisory Staffs, Executives andTechnicians (ASSET) are suing a number of employers who have deferredthe implementation of pay increases for bsresch of coisstract.   A list of theemployers concerned and the likely date for the hearings is annexed.    Ineach case the employer has been acting in accordance with theGovernment^ request that the operative date of pay increases due undercommitments entered into on or before 20th July, 1966 but not yetimplemented should be deferred by sisi months and that in no case should payment be made before the end of 1966 (paragraphs 19-23 of theWhite Paper on the Prices and Incomes Standstill, Cmnd. 3073).2.       The Government have made it clear that they expect the parties concerned to observe the request for a standstill on a voluntary basis,and that they will not resort to the temporary powers which they havetaken in Part IV of the Prices and Incomes Act to support the standstillunless this is necessary to ensure that the standstill is not underminedby the actions of a selfish minority who are not prepared to co-operate.The Minister of Labour made it clear in a letter sent to the confederation of British Industry (CBI) on 24th August that the Government expected the deferment of increases due under existing commitments to be achieved by agreement whenever possible but that where this did not prove possible the right course was to withhold increases which would constitute a breach of the standstill provisions.    Thus, in cases wherethere was a conflict between the requirements of the standstill and an employer!s obligations under the law of contract, the requirements ofthe standstill were to be regarded as overriding.    This was essential in the national interest if the standstill was to be maintained.3.     In these circumstances, ASSET5s actions represent a directchallenge to the Governments policy.    The first action to be heard willbe at Edmonton County Court on Thursday, 29th September.    this involves Thorn Electrical Industries who admit to a contractual liability to pay a wage increase backdated to 1st April, and whose sole defence will be that, since the increase had not been paid by 20th July it had been deferred in accordance with the Governments request.    Since, however,there is at present no legal backing for the policy of deferring existingpay commitments, the case is likely to be judged solely on the basis ofcontractual law and it seems highly probable that the employers will loseand have costs awarded against them.    There is no reason why thecourts decision should be delayed, and no grounds for an appeal against an adverse decision are known at present.    The company have, in fact,already arranged to see tne Ministry of Labour the following day,30th September, to ask advice on the action which they should now take.4.      The Government will therefore need to consider urgently whethera decision against the employers in the Thorn case on 29th Septemberwould justify bringing Part TV of the Prices and Incomes Act into forceand, if not, what other action should be taken to maintain the standstill.-1-
Provisions of Part IV5.      Part TV of the Prices and Incomes Act contains four main sets of provisions f-Sections 26 and 28 empower the Government to make orders(subject to negative resolution) directing that specified prices or charges (section 26) or specified rates of remuneration (section 28)shall not be increased from the date of the order without Ministerialconsent.Sections 27 and 29 empower the Government to give directions(in the case of prices) or make orders (in the case of pay) reversingprices or pay increases implemented since the Prime Ministersrequest for a standstill on 20th July, 1966.    A period of at leastfourteen days for interested parties to make representations is needed.Thus an order could be made under section 29 (again subject tonegative resolution) providing that such remuneration as might be described in the order should not, without permission, be higher thanthat paid by the employer for the same kind of work before 20th July, 1966,Section 30 gives a general protection, effective from the date upon which Fart IV comes into operation, to employers who, in response to the Governments request for a standstill, and after givingthe employees concerned not less than one week,s notice, voluntarilywithhold pay increases to which they may be entitled under their contracts of employment.Sections 31 and 32 empower the Ministers concerned to defer the effective dates of Wages Regulations Orders made under the WagesCouncil Act and the Agricultural Wages Acts, respectively,6.     The powers in Part TV can be brought into operation by Orderin Council at any time during the twelve months following the date onwhich the Act received Royal Assent (12th August, 1966).     The powers are effective immediately upon the making of the Order in Council butcease to have effect unless the Order in Council is confirmed by affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament within twenty-eightcalendar days.    (It is now less than twenty-eight days to the reassemblyof Parliament on 18th October).     The powers in Part TV lapseautomatically and without provision for renewal on 11th August, 1967.7.      There is no statutory requirement to consult both sides ofindustry before bringing Part IV into force (as in the case of Part ii of the Prices and Incomes Act).    However, given the importance ofsecuring the co-operation of the CBI and TUG in the development ofthe policy during the period of severe restraint in the first half of 1967and in the longer term, it is clearly desirable for the Government tohave talks with both bodies before an Order in Council is made.    TheFirst Secretary has recently given them assurances to this effect.-2-
Possible courses of action in relation to the Thorn case8.     Whilst ASSET are suing Thorn&apos;s for breach of their contract ofemployment with an individual worker, this is of course regarded asa test case.    If ASSET win, Thorn will be expected to pay the increasenot only to the particular individual concerned but to all their workers who are in the same position (numbering up to 200).    If they refuse todo this, the remaining workers could be expected to bring similaractions and in addition ASSET might well threaten strike action.    Itwould seem unwise for the Government to seek to persuade the firm to withhold the pay increase from these other workers.9.     An alternative possibility would be for Thorn&apos;s to pay theincrease in the test case and to give their other workers notice to terminate and renew their existing contracts of employment in a way which enables them to observe the standstill requirements.    the employer would then only be liable until the expiry of such notices.Although this course has been suggested by the CBI, it would seem likely to be generally regarded as provocative^ particularly in presentcircumstances and the Government would be open to widespreadcriticism if they pressed this course on employers,10.     A third course would be to enter into immediate consultations with the CBI and TUC with a view to bringing Part IV&quot; of the prices and Incomes Act into force at a very early date.    The only directresult of bringing Part IV into force would be to activate section 30.This would automatically indemnify employers who disregard pay increases in existing contracts which fall due to be paid after Part TVcomes into force, subject to the giving of at least a week&apos;s notice.It would not, however, protect employers against actions which might at any time be brought based on contractual obligations to increasepay incurred before the date when Part IV was brought into force.Pay increases arising from such actions would be a continuing liability.Thus section 30 by itself would not give any direct assistance to Thornsor to other employs rs in the same circumstances, but would reassureother employers with contractual liabilities taking effect at a future date.11.     To restore rates of pay to those prevailing before 20th Julyit would be necessary to have recourse to an Order under section 29 ofthe Act.    This would have the effect of overriding any contractualliability from the date of the Order.    The sanction for disregardingsuch an order is prosecution, subject to the Attorney General&apos;consent.    The Attorney General will need to be consulted about the precise scope of the Secretary of State&apos;s powers under this section inrelation to this type of case,l \12.     Whilst section 30 indemnifies employers who break their contracts in accordance with the Government^ request for defermentit imposes no sanction on unions or workers who strike againstemployers for breaking such contracts.    In the case of orders undersection 29, however, unions and employees would be liable (with theconsent of the Attorney General) to prosecution if they were to strike or threaten to strike to induce an employer to contravene the order.Whilst the maximum penalty which may be imposed on a non-corporatebody (including trade unions) is  100 in proceedings in a magistrates -3-
court or  5 00 in a higher court offenders could, under the existing law,be committed to prison if they failed to pay their fines.    Whilst theHome Secretary is proposing to modify this provision in the forthcomingCriminal Justice Bill, this is unlikely to be enacted until some time in1967.     There is, therefore, a potential risk of &quot;martyrdom&quot; inrelation to offences under Part IV of the Act.13.     The fourth possibility would be for the Government to seek to restrict any repercussions of the Thorn case beyond the 200 workerscovered by the same agreement without resorting at this stage to part TV powers.    The chances of successfully maintaining the standstill on this basis would depend largely on the attitude of other employersand unions to a decision which spotlights the conflict between therequirements of contract law and the voluntary standstill policy.    Itis not easy to predict precisely how the situation is likely to develop,but an early test will come in relation to pay increases due on 3rd Octoberunder an existing 3-year agreement to some 5, 000 of Thorn*s employees who are members of the Transport and General workers Union and theAmalgamated Engineering Union.    If these are prepared to agree todeferment in accordance with the standstill policy, even after ASSEThave obtained a decision in their favour, this should help in maintaining the line elsewhere.    On the other hand, if an award in favour of ASSETin the Thornls case is followed up by further victories in the courts,this will increase the tensions substantially.Views of CBI and TUC14.     The CBI&apos;s view so far has been that a successful action byASSET (or even several successful actions) could by no means be held to justify the major steps of activating Part TV.    The TUC have not yetexpressed a view, but the acting General Secretary has reacted againstthe CBI&apos;s suggestion that employers should instead be asked to terminate contracts of employment.    The overriding aim should be tosecure and retain the co-operation of the CBI and TUC in working outthe criteria for prices and incomes in the period of -severe restraint andsubsequently, and above all in operating machinery for making iteffective,15.     Arguments in favour of bringing Part IV into force at an earlydate are that it would demonstrate the importance which the government attached to the standstill and bear witness to the Government!s desirenot to let the co-operation of the majority be undermined by the actions of a selfish minority.    It should also be helpful in limiting the reper-cussions of the Thorn case (and other similar cases) and deterringothers from seeking to breach the standstill though legal or industrial action.    The Thorn case probably presents as favourable an opportunityfor taking action as is likely to occur.16.     Against bringing Part IV into force as a result of the Thorncase, it can be argued that this would attribute much too muchinfluence to the actions of Mr. Clive Jenkins and ASSET.    Moreimportant, however, it is necessary to estimate the extent to whichresort to compulsory powers might jeopardise, rather than reinforce,the present voluntary standstill.    There might be a tendency, oncePart TV had been brought into force, for the CBI and TUC (and indeedindividual employers and trade unions) to think that the onus of applying-4-
the standstill had been transferred from them to the Government..The Government in turn would be faced with some embarrassment inrelation to individual breaches of the standstill^ of greater or less importance, since it would be necessary to decide whether or not tomake use of the available powers in each case and to be prepared todefend the decision publicly.    These difficulties would continue andmight become worse in the period of severe restraint.Conclusions17.     This seems to point to:-(a) entering into early discussion with the CBI and TUC whenthe court  s decision in the Thorn case is known, butdeferring a firm decision on the activation of Part IVuntil those consultations have taken place;(b) making it clear that -(i)   the only direct effect of activating Part IV willbe the limited one of making the indemnificationin section 30   effectivej(ii)   it would be the Governments intention to confineany use of the other powers in Part IV to deal withparticular cases only in so far as this seemedessential in support of the voluntary policy.11-5-
