IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)C(66) 127 COPY NO.9th August, 1966CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE PORTSMemqrandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic AffairsOur Election Manifesto commits us to introducing a measurereorganise and modernise the nation&apos;s ports on the basis of a strongNational Ports Authority and publicly owned Regional Port Authorities.2.       The report of the Port Transport Study Group of the Labour Party(the Mikardo Report) has been considered by a working group of officials,who have in turn reported to the Ministerial Committee on reorganisation of the Docks.    The Ministerial Committee are agreed upon the broadlines upon which further examination should go forward, but a number ofimportant points require further consideration before we are in a positionto put detailed recommendations to the Cabinet.     This memorandum is thus in the nature of an interim report for the information of the Cabinet,and I do not propose to ask for discussion at a meeting unless any of mycolleagues considers that we are not going forward on the right lines.organisation.      Ministers agreed with the recommendations of the Mikardo group and of the Official Working Group that there should be a National PortsAuthority with general policy control over a number of Regional port authorities.    Gui&quot; view was that there was need for a strong centralauthority.    Officials provisionally recommended five regional avithorities,one for the South East, one for the South West and Wales, one for theNorth West, one for the North East and one for Scotland,    Ministersthought that these authorities would be too large;  in particular wedoubted whether it made sense to have a single authority covering notonly London and the East and South East coast ports but also Southamptonand other South coast ports.    On the other hand we thought that a purelyestuarial grouping, as proposed by the Mikardo Group, would make fortoo many authorities, some of whom would inevitably cover only a relatively small number of less important ports and would therefore be liable to be dominated by the major estuarial groupings.    Our preferencewould therefore be for a structure of about ten regional authorities,based on the major estuaries, and we have invited officials to consider further the functions of the National Ports Authority and of the B.egionalPort Authorities, and the relationships between the two, on this general basis.-1.
The Ports4.       The Mikardo Group proposed that all ports should be taken overby the new authorities.     To nationalise at one go 700 ports of differentsizes and characters and with a great variety of constitutions would present the new authorities with enormously difficult practical problems.Officials proposed that in the first instance the following classes of ports(covering nearly 100 ports) should be taken over:-(i)      All the ports at present vested in the British transport docks Board (29 ports).(ii)      All the ports at which the National Dock Labour Schemeoperates (61 ports).(iii)      All other ports where the tonnage of foreign tradeexceeds 100, 000 tons a year (13 ports).These ports would be brought into national ownership on a vesting datelaid down by legislation.    The new authorities would be given a duty tokeep under review the other ports in their regions, and would beempowered to submit schemes for acquisition of such ports.     Portsowned by the British Railways Board, ports which form part of theindustrial process of a single user, fishery harbours and marine workswould in general be excluded from nationalisation.5.       Ministers agreed with the general principle that only the larger and more significant ports should be taken over in the first instance,and that there should be placed upon the new authorities the duty to keepother ports under review and the power to submit schemes for acquisitionof such ports.    But we thought that even 100 ports were likely torepresent a substantial administrative problem., and officials are beinginstructed to study the possibility of reducing further the number of ports to be taken over in the first instance by excluding some of the sm.allerports where the National Dock Labour Scheme at present operates.    Wehave directed that this study should be based on the assumption that theNational Dock Labour Scheme would not continue to operate after the vesting date.6.,      We have also instructed officials to give further consideration tothe procedure for acquisition of other ports by the new authorities, andin particular to the question whether legislation should confer a statutoryright of objection on persons affected.Constitution of Auifaorities and workers&apos; pa-rticipation7.      Ministers agreed that appointments to the new authorities shouldbe made by the Minister of Transport on a non-representational basis.Members would be appointed from among persons who had wide experience and had shown capacity in transport, industrial, commercial or financial matters, in administration, applied science or the organisa-tion of workers.    This would follow the general lines adopted in theIron and Steel Bill.    On this basis the Minister of Transport would be free to appoint to the Authorities people in dock management or officials-2-
f* /&quot;% pvl el rc xjjtpi A iof unions  with representation in the docks, if they seemed suitable for appointment; but they would not be appointed in a representativecapacity.     Officials of unions with representation in the docks would berequired to give up their existing offices if they accepted appointment to a port authority.8.       This would run counter to the Mikardo Group:s recommendation that &quot;some members /of the authorities7 should be representatives of organised labour in the industry on similar lines to National Dock labour board practice. &quot;   We considered that workers1 participation could beachieved more satisfactorily by relying on the Mikardo Group&apos;s othersuggestion for the appointment of Group Operating Committees to assist in the management of individual ports.    iSach port would have a managerwho would have final responsibility under the Regional Port Authority,but he and his principal officers would be members of a Group OperatingCommittee and he would be guided by and would have to justify hisdecisions to the Committee.     The Group Operating Committee would include representatives of workers; the arrangements by which theirrepresentatives would be chosen would be for further discussion in due course with the unions concerned.9.       Officials suggested that there should be four to six members of theNational Ports Avithority, of whom not less than three should be full-time,and in addition that the Chairmen of the Regional Port Authorities shouldbe members of the National Ports Authority.    They also suggested thatthere should be about eight members of each Regional Port Authority,of whom not less than two should be full-time.    Ministers consideredthat a substantially higher proportion of members would need to be full-time, and invited officials to prepare revised proposals accordingly.Timetable10.     Officials drew a distinction between existing port authorities (andlicensing authorities under the new Docks and Harbours Bill) on the onehand and other port operators on the other.     They thought that bothcategories would need to be taken over, but that it might in practice bedifficult for the new authorities to take over all the bodies concerned onthe same date.     They therefore suggested a two-stage operation, whereby the new authorities would first take over the functions of the existing port authorities and the licensing authorities and then a year later would takeover the remaining port operators.     On the assumption that thenecessary legislation could not be introduced before 1968-69 this wouldmean a vesting date in 1970 for the main authorities and a secondvesting date in 1971 for the other operators.    Ministers considered thatit was undesirable that the takeover operation should be spread over two stages, and that the practical difficulties foreseen could be to a la.rgeextent overcome by setting up the new national and regional authorities on a &quot;shadow&quot; basis directly after second reading of the NationalisationBill, so that they could immediately start to prepare the process oftakeover.    We also thought it desirable that legislation should beincluded in the 1968-69 programme with a view to a vesting date early in1970.     We instructed officials to consider the arrangements fornationalisation further on this basis.    The Minister of Transport will be discussing with the Future Legislation Committee how this Bill can befitted into the 1968-69 programme.-3-
12.     The knowledge that nationalisation is in the wind is liable to weaken the readiness both of employers and of unions to co-operate ondecasualisation.    Uncertainty about the scope and timing of nationalisa-tion will add to the difficulties of Lord Brown&apos;s National ModernisationCommittee, and is already having an effect on morale and recruitmentin the National Dock Labour Board.    Ministers therefore agreed that atthe appropriate time - perhaps when the report of the Devlin Committeeis received - the Government should make a statement on the followingline s: -(i)      It will be several years before the Governments proposalsfor nationalisation can become fully operative;  if the timetable suggested in the report of the Working Group,namely legislation in the 1968-69 session, to come intoeffect in 1970, could be indicated, so much the better.(ii)      In the Governments view the system of decasualisationcan during the interim period bring real benefits todock workers and make an important contribution to increased efficiency,(iii) The Government intend to co-operate to the full with theindustry in bringing it into operation promptly.(iv) The Government give assurances (in terms to be agreed by the Ministers concerned and the Treasury) aboutthe position of existing employees upon nationalisation.Consultation13.     Officials are being instructed to press forward with the furtherstudies and examinations that are required, and. to report to the ministerial Committee on the Reorganisation of the Docks as soon aspossible after the Recess.    The Ministerial Committee will then submitdetailed recommendations to the Cabinet.    If the Cabinet endorse those recommendations, the way will then be clear for the necessary processes of consultation with both sides of the industry.     In the meantime it isessential that the Minister of Transport should consult with the national ports Council; they are her statutory advisers on ports matters, andthey have already expressed some concern at not being consulted beforethe decision to nationalise the ports was announced.    The ministerial committee agreed that the Minister of Transport should proceedimmediately to confidential consultation with the National Ports Council,on the basis that at this stage she would outline the major issues whichthe Government v/ere considering in connection with the question of nationalisation and should obtain the views of the National Ports Councilon these issues.G. B.Department of Economic Affairs, S. W. 1,9th August, 1966. .-Other matters11.     A numbex- of other points remain for further consideration,including the allocation of responsibility for inland clearance depots andof responsibility for pilotage, towage and lighterage, as well as thebasis of compensation.Decasualisation
