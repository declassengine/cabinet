BIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT;(66) 119copy m6726th July, 1966CABINETTHE AIRCRAFT industry memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic affairs at their meeting on 25th July the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Development considered three memoranda by the Minister of aviation on:(a) Re-equipment of British European Airways Corporation (BEA)(ED(66) 74) &apos;(b) Proposed Merger of the Two Aero-engine Croups (ED(66) 72)(c) Reorganisation of the Air-frame Industry (ED(66) 71)The problems are fully set out in those memoranda, and I do net try todo more than summarise them here.BEA re-equipment2.       The main issue for decision on BEA re-equipment v/as whetherBEA should be allowed to buy American aircraft, which would be more economical for them but would cost a substantial sum in dollars, orwhether they should be required to buy British aircraft.   The penalties for buying British aircraft include higher capital costs to BEA, some-thing like a year&apos;s delay in the introduction of new aircraft, and some-what higher operating costs because the seating capacity of the british aircraft would not be the optimum, capacity for the routes in question,at any rate in the early years.     This would amount to a penalty of ;^26million to  32 million talcing capital and operating costs together, andwould mean a return on capital so low as to involve BEA in a loss of 4 million to  6 million a year.    In addition the Government v/ould beexpected to spend up to  20 million on launching aid for the british aircraft (probably &quot;stretched&quot; VC 10s and Tridents).     BEA would needan assurance mat, if the Government required them to buy British,the Government would in one way or another indemnify them against theloss which they would be likely to incur as a result.
3.       There was general agreement on the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Development that BEA should be required to buy british aircraft, even though it would mean giving British aircraft a preference of over 60 per cent.     The main considerations leading to this decision were the implications for the balance of payments of authorising BEA,as well as BOAC, to order Boeings, and the thought that, if BEA nowbought American, the prospects of the British aircraft industry in the medium-haul civil airline field would be seriously, perhaps irreparably,damaged.    The Committee accepted that this would entail an assurance to BEA that the Government would see them through the consequences ofthis decision, but thought that there 3hould be further detailed study ofthe amount of assistance and the means by which it should be given toBEA, of the size, make up and timing of BEA orders, and of the implications of asking BEA to postpone re-equipment on domesticroutes in order to reduce investment expenditure in 1967-68.Aero-engine merger4.       The proposal is for a merger which would amalgamate BristolSiddeley Engines Limited with Rolls Royce.     This would be a straightcommercial merger;  there is no question of Government participation in the new concern.    The Committee agreed that the merger v/as in theinterests of the efficiency of the industry and of enabling our industry to stand up to competition with American manufacturers (particularly Prattand Whitney) in international markets.5.       If the merger goes ahead, there will be a problem of what to do with Bristol&apos;s holding in Short Brothers and Karland.     There may be some expectation that the Government should buy this to add to theirexisting holding in the company.    No decision was taken on this; ;theMinister of Aviation was invited to put it up as a separate propositionif he wished to do so.Reorganisation of the air-frame industry.       The question here is what to do about the two main companies,British Aircraft Corporation (BAG) and Hawker Siddeley (KS), following the Plowden Report.    The Minister of Aviation suggested that therewere five possible courses of action:(a) To leave things as they are,(b) To take a 100 per cent shareholding in both BAC and KS.(c) To take a 100 per cent shareholding in BAC and a minority, say30 per cent, shareholding in ECS.(d) To take a 100 per cent in BAC with no shareholding in HS,(e) To take a 100 per cent in BAC and use this holding to representa minority holding in a merged KS and BAC.In view of uncertainty in the industry he was anxious for an early decision.    He thought that in practice the choice was between leavingthings as they are and taking a 100 per cent shareholding in both firms,and he argued in favour of the latter.
7.       Some of us had a good deal of doubt about the proposal that theGovernment should entirely take over both companies, which betweenthem represent the greater part of the air-frame industry.     The fore-casts of future load on the industry make clear that after 1970 bothresearch and development and production are bound to decline;  this willsooner or later mean rationalisation of the structure of the industry andits use of resources, and some tough and painful decisions.    None of ushas great confidence in the management of BAG, but we think that theexisting management of HS would be capable of carrying a process ofthis kind through;   and we are not clear that the existing management of HS would be available to a 100 per cent Government-owned concern.Several members of the Committee doubted whether the Governmentshould take over the air-frame industry just at the point when it can beseen to be facing a substantial decline, and thought that more considera-tion should be given to the other possibilities, and in particular to thepossibility of buying out BAG and then combining HS and BAG in a new company in which Government ownership of BAC would represent asubstantial minority holding.     This could set a useful precedent, notunlike the Fairfield arrangement, for other measures of rationalisationin which Government and private enterprise co-operated and sharedresponsibility.8.       The Committee agreed that this whole problem should be furtherstudied in detail by a Sub-Committee of Ministers before decisions were taken, and agreed to defer a decision for the time being.    From thepoint of view of the industry I doubt if anything fundamental will be lost by some further delay in taking a decision;  and in any case, even if wewere eventually to come down in favour of a 100 per cent takeover ofboth companies, this might not be the best moment at which to announcesuch a decision.conclusions therefore invite the Cabinet to endorse the following conclusions:BEA should be required to buy British.BEA should be given an assurance that the Government would be willing in principle in one way or another to help BEA to dealwith the commercial problems with which this decision would present them.There should be further study of the means by which assistance should be given to BEA, of the size, make up and timing ofBEA orders and of the implications of postponing re-equipment of domestic routes.Rolls Rcyce and Bristol Sidd.eley should be told that theGovernment see no objection in principle to the proposedmerger of their aero-engine interests.No decision should be taken for the time being on reorganisation of the air-frame industry, while the matter is further studied by a Sub-Committee of Ministers.(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)
Proposals are being put to the Prime Minister for the composition and terms of reference of the proposed Sub-Committee, and I propose thatit should be asked to deal not only with the reorganisation of the air-frame industry but with the matters arising from the decision to requireBEA to buy British (see (3)),Department of Economic Affairs, S.7\T.l.26th July, 1966
