The committee invited me to discuss the matter further with the Treasury and the Boardof Trade and, if agreement could not be reached, to bring it to theCabinet.A further meeting was held yesterday and no agreement wasreached.

ZAMBIA:  INTENSIFICATION OF SANCTIONSMemorandum by the Minister of State for commonwealth relations .       Sanctions PolicyOur Rhodesian policy rests upon pursuing sanctions to the point at which the regime will be ready to reach a settlement on our terms.Sanctions are certainly now having an increasing effect on the rhodesian economy.    But unless they can be significantly stepped up,and their effect accelerated, we may well face a long haul during whichit is possible that other countries will lose heart and allow their ownsanctions to crumble.    Experience shows that it is only by the continuousinjection of steam that our policy of non-mandatory sanctions can maintain its momentum with international support.2.      Rhodesian foreign reserves are likely to be enough to last atleast another year;  oil and essential imports continue to flow in viaSouth Africa and Mozambique;  last year&apos;s budget surplus has been usedto finance the new planting of the tobacco crop.    But it is now the case that industry and employment are suffering the effects of loss of exportoutlets, to the extent that the business community is now distinctlyworried about future  prospects.3.      It is only by blocking the remaining export outlets that oursanctions policy can be made more effective,   The one measure left tous is to block and keep blocked Rhodesian exports to Zambia.    before i. d. i. these amounted to  46 million   a year, including re-exports from rhodesia;  constituted 30 per cent of Rhode sian-produced exports; andaccounted for 17-18 per cent of the output of Rhodesian manufacturing industry.4.     According to an interdepartmental review undertaken last month by a Working Party of economists and officials from all the Departmentsconcerned, &quot;the elimination of the remainder of these manufacturedimports, together with the multiplier effects of such a move withinRhodesia, would obviously deal a further serious blow to the Rhodesianeconomy which might have a critical effect on the Rhodesian will to resist. &quot;5.      The more effectively sanctions can bring about a rapid end to the rhodesian crisis, the more quickly we shall be relieved of a continuousheavy drain on our own balance of payments.     The Working Partyestimated that the cost to britain s balance of payments of maintainingsanctions at their present level, and other expenditure associated withthe Rhodesian crisis, is about  5 0 million a year,British proposals.      Since May we have been continuously engaged in trying to persuade the Zambians to impose a planned and selective cut-off oftheir remaining trade with Rhodesia.    At the beginning of this yearZambia started the firsl^stages of such a plan by banning some 43 percent of normal Rhodesian imports (largely inessentials).    In April,
however, the situation was greatly complicated by the RhodesiaRailways crisis, with consequent effects on Zambian imports andcopper exports, as described in Annex A to this paper.     The latest information is that essential imports through Rhodesia will be resumed7.     During the period March-May, Zambia reached a new policydecision to undertake a long-term total disengagement of trade from rhodesia over at least 18 months, and linked with a steady but slowdevelopment of alternative routes, on the assumption that there wouldnot be an earlier solution to the Rhodesian crisis.     There was an obvious dichotomy between this approach and our own need for a muchmore rapid programme of sanctions, which was bridged by a &quot;time-scale formula&quot; relating our assistance to the actual duration of theemergency.     This meant that we would be released from any under -takings on longer term assistance when the emergency  ended.Conversely, the Zambians would be given a basis from which to proceerapidly with the initial steps in their longer term disengagement from rhodesia.    The present position is that an offer from us lies on the table, which the Zambians have so far refused to accept, consisting of 6. 85 million for expenditure in the rest of 1966, plus an offer to review the situation in December, 1966, if the emergency still continues.     Our offer, of course, represents a continuation of theassistance to Zambia which we have been giving since i. d. i.8.      Zambia&apos;s rejection of our June offer was principally due to thefollowing factors:-(a) Suspicion of Her Majestyls Governments motives in theSalisbury talks, which our repeated assurances have sofar failed to remove.i\(b) The feeling that by putting a financial ceiling on our offer we were limiting our financial commitment to zambia   and thus also our moral commitment to ending the Rhodesian rebellion.    The Zambians claim that weshould &quot;see Zambia   through&quot; by open-ended support ofthe projects needed to develop alternative supply routes,and power and fuel sources.*,9.     We cannot accept any obligation to &quot;open-ended&quot; commitments.Nor do I think it reasonable, in our present economic situation, toask for a greater amount of assistance for expenditure in 1966.    ButMinisters have already agreed to a review at the   end of the year.I therefore suggest that the way through this problem is to askMinisters, in effect, to have now the review that would otherwise becarried out before the end of 1966j to determine the amount of continuing assistance on agreed projects to be given for the first halfof 1967, assuming always, that the emergency still continues; and toallow me to inform the Zambiano of this at this stage.    This, I believewill enable me to give to the Zambians the assurance they ask ofBritish commitment to essential projects.
SECRET15810.     I therefore propose;-(i)      that we extend our present offer of  6. 85 million,for expenditure on agreed projects in 1966, by afurther  7 million for the continuation of agreedprojects during the first half of 1967;(ii)      that our assistance should be discontinued if thereis a return to constitutional rule in Rhodesia and to normal communications between Rhodesia, andZambia; (see paragraph 12 below)(iii) that we should be reimbursed with the residualvalue of any assets acquired with British money ondisposal;(iv) that within the assistance offered, there should be aflexibility of allocation to agreed projects; (seeparagraph 13 below)(v)      that should 1966 expenditure on agreed projectsexceed  6. 85 million, Zambia should be reimbursedfrom the  7 million offer for 1967;  (seeparagraph 11 below)(vi)      that should Zambia leave the Commonwealth or breakrelations with Britain, the British offer would bere considered.    (See paragraph 15 below)Zambian capacity to spend11,     It is in fact most unlikely that more than two-thirds of the amountallocated for  1966 could be spent on the projects identified as essential.The Zambians believe that these projects can be achieved in 1966 by themounting of a crash programme, and that this will require more than  6. 85 million - or in other words that only money is the limiting factor.    Our technical advice, however, is that the limiting factorswill be those of planning, contracting, equipment and. man-power.But if we should prove to be wrong, the Zambians ca.n be reimbursedin the first six months of 1967.12.     It is emphasised that the principle of discontinuing assistanceat the end of the emergency would of course apply.    It has already beenmade clear to the Zambians that, except for inevitable compensation payments for any cancellation of contracts, British assistance would cease as soon as there is a return to constitutional rule in rhodesia and normal communications with Zambia have been restored.13.     In renewing our offer of  6, 85 million a reasonable degree of flexibility is necessary.    Even with the most thorough advance technicalinvestigations precise forecasts of expenditure are not possible.Adjustment must be made in the light of experience, and allowancegiven for new problems and priorities.     Therefore a degree ofoverall flexibility is essential if we are to get the best and fastestresults for our money.    At Annex B, I suggest an allocation as betweenpr oj e ct s of our offer for 1966 of ic 6. 85 million which is likely to meetthe present assessment of priorities, recognising the possible need forflexible adjustment.
14.     In return for our offer we would expect the Zambians todevelop and sustain a planned programme of sanctions against rhodesia, by careful selection of each item to be embargoed, taking into account the degree of labour intensiveness involved in its produc-tion in Rhodesia (particularly in terms of European employment), itsbulk (in terms of import route capacity), and its importance forZambian needs.15.     It would also be indicated to the Zambians that the British offer would be made as between Comm. on wealth partners.    Should Zambialeave the Commonwealth or break off diplomatic relations with Britainthe British offer would need reconsideration in the light of whatever thenew situation proved to be.A Commonwealth crisis of confidence16.     Ministers will wish to consider the proposals in this paper inthe light of the present delicate and difficult situation -which is develop-in g within the Commonwealth as a result of the Rhodesian crisis.17.     Zambian distrust of Britain has mounted steadily over the last five months.    It has now reached a climax of emotionalism, andiri*relations.lity, despite all our efforts.    As we approach theCommonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Conference in September, British-Zarabian relations are near flash-point; any explosion could affect thewhole British position in Africa, the Commonwealth and the united nations.     We cannot hope to x-esolve the problem merely by reaching agreement with the Zambians on the intensification of sanctions.     Inany case it may now be that no offer we make will induce them to agreewith us.     Kaunda will continue to doubt the sincerity of our intentionsabout Rhodesia unless he gets the political assurances he is seeking.But the Zambian crisis could start off a chain-reaction in the AfricanCommonwealth.    Our High Commissioners have told us that, in forexample, Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda and perhaps even Kenya theGovernments would certainly be influenced in their own decisions aboutcontinuing membership of the Commonwealth, by the snood and context of a Zambian departure, and the reaction of other African commonwealth countries to it.     This involves aspects of Her Majesty^ government&apos;s policy which lie beyond the scope of this paper.    But if agreement could be reached on the lines I suggest between Her majesty government and Zambia about British assistance for the intensification of Zambian sanctions against Smith, this in itself would go a long way toincrease African confidence in the firmness and sincerity of her majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s intentions about Rhodesia, and would help tocreate a much more receptive atmosphere at the September Conferenceof Commonwealth Prime Ministers.    We face, of course, a difficultPrime Ministers&apos; Conference in any case; but at worst we could alsoface a possible break-up of the Commonwealth.18.     I therefore request the approval of Ministers to the resumptionof negotiations on the basis recommended in this paper.J. H.Commonwealth -Relations Office, S. W. 1.26th July, 1966
ANNEX ARhodesia RailwaysZambia&apos;s trade relations with Rhodesia, and hence hereffectiveness as a partner in our sanctions policy, have been compli-cated by difficulties over Rhodesia Railways, which is a unitary systemof communications serving both countries.    It is this fact which made it only too easy for both countries to use the Railways as a pawn intheir political and economic confrontation.    For the first four monthsafter i. d. i. both countries permitted traffic to continue virtuallyunhampered, but the Railways gradually ran into severe financial difficulties (main!-/ because our oil embargo stopped freight earningson POL.).    Zambia&apos;s refusal to help resolve these difficulties bypermitting cash transfers from the Railways account in Zambia to theKfe account in Rhodesia aggravated the situation and brought a counter -demand from Rhodesia that all payments for Zambian imports and exports should be met in advance, and in hard currency.     The Zambiansrefused to accept these conditions, because they were unwilling therebyto increase Rhodesian foreign reserves, and in the present situation nocopper is being exported via Rhodesia Railways (which has reducedcopper exports to less than one-third of normal) and only a modesttrickle of essential imports (except coal) has entered Zambia.2.       The latest information, however, is that the Zambians haveagreed to a resumption of essential imports, and of exports, overRhodesia Railways, on condition that no freight payments are madedirect to Rhodesia.    So far as exports are concerned this stipulationhas direct implications for us, which are discussed in the following paragraph.3.       Under present exchange control rules payments by UnitedKingdom residents to residents of Rhodesia, including the Railways,may be made only in sterling to Rhodesian Account.     The Smithregime insist on convertible currency in advance.    It would be con-trary to our exchange control sanctions policy to allow United Kingdomresidents to make such payments in convertible currency, whether directly or through a third country.    I am aware that a refusal to relaxour exchange control rules would have implications for our coppersupplies, but any relaxation of our policy would certainly be criticised by the Zambians as a relaxation of sanctions because of british commercial interests, and would undermine our efforts to secureco-operation in our sanctions policy from other countries.
