Annex to C(66) 125Draft White Paper ,       gBROADCASTINGIntroduction1.     The Government have had under review various major aspectsof &quot;broadcasting policy.    First among then was the question of the bbc&apos;s finances.   Besides this, there were various proposals forthe further extension of the broadcasting services; that xhe.reshould be a fourth television service; that a service of localsound broadcasting should be introduced; and that there should bean extra service of sound broadcasting entirely given over tomusic.2.     The Government have thought it best to consider them as a comprehensive whole.   For two other major questions it was however desirable for the Government to publish their views beforethe general review was completed.   A Bill to put an end to theactivities of pirate radio stations has already been introduced.And on colour television, the Postmaster General announced on 3rd March last the decision that a service using the PALtransmission system and broadcast on the 625-line standard would start towards the end of next year.3.     In reaching the conclusions announced in this review, it hasof course been the Government1s duty not only to consider whatpurposes the proposals for further extending the broadcasting services should seek to serve, and what organisation would bestpromote those purposes.    The Government have also had to consider to what extent it would be in the national economic interest toallow these extensions.    It is not enough that they should bedesirable in themselves.    The overriding consideration is whetherthe country can afford them.THE FINANCES OF THE BBCThe BBCs request for an increase in the licence feek. Following the report of the Pilkington Committee in 1962, the bbc were authorised;(a) to provide an additional television service - 3BC2;(b) to provide self-contained television services forScotland and Wales;(c) greatly to increase the number of hours for which itsThird Programme/Network Three broadcasts.    It nowbroadcasts throughout the day;(d) to&apos; extend the Light Programme.    It now broadcasts from5.30 a.n. until 2 a.m,;(e) to provide more programmes of adult education on television.   Beth BBC and ITA have made full use ofthis authority; and(f) to start colour television on bbc.- 1 -
The decision to authorise these major developments waswelcomed; and, except for colour television - which is to startnext year - they either have &quot;been or are being carried into effect,5*.     The understanding on which the BBC proceeded to carry out this programme was that they would be afforded sufficient income&apos;to finance adequate services.   In their Annual Report for 1962-63,the Corporation record that if they had received the full proceeds of a  5 licence from 1st April 1963? for which they had asked,they could have financed their services out of income until theend of the een sixties. &apos; The Corporations request was notgranted, but from October 1963? when the Government of the dayrelinquished the  1 annual excise duty, an amount equal to thewhole of the net proceeds of a  k licence became payable to theCorporation.6.     In October 1964? the BBC represented to the Government thatthe combined television and sound licence fee should be raised &apos;from  4 to  6, and the sound-only fee from  1 to  1 5s,   It was.of course, the Government&apos;s duty first to satisfy themselves that increases of this order would be justified.    But it was also plain that some immediate action was called for to put the BBC in funds.The Government therefore decided that there should be a closeenquiry into the Corporation^ finances, but, as an^ interim measure, also authorised increases in the combined licence feefrom  4 to  5, and in the sound-only fee from  1 to  1 !3s.   Bothincreases took effect on 1st August 1965.The Government&apos;s enquiry7.     The Government have completed their enquiry into the BBCsfinances.   Practically speaking, the only possible ways ofproviding finance for the BBC are; by direct Government subvention.,by the sale of advertising time in the Corporations services, orby the licence-fee system,8.     A Government subvention would be liable to expose theCorporation to financial control in such detail as would proveincompatible with the BBCs independence.    The money would, ofcourse, have to be found from general taxation,9.     Under their Licence and Agreement (Cmnd.2236) the BBC arenot allowed to broadcast commercial advertieements without firsthaving sought and obtained the Postmaster General&apos;s permission.Because of the probable long-term effect on the character of their services the BBC have never sought this permission.    The Governmentrecall that the Pilkington Committee found&apos;against the financing of the BBC in any measure from advertising, and that this viewcommanded general acceptance.10.    The Government have decided that there should be no changeat present in the arrangement whereby the BBC are financed throughthe licence fee system.    But at a time when none may be content torest upon present standards of efficiency and financial performancegood though they may be, the Government have thought it right to expect of the BBC that they should set themselves even moreexacting financial objectives.    They have accordingly asked them whether, assuming the expenditure ceiling which would be impliedif there were no increase in the licence fee for the present, theCorporation would be able to maintain their present services, andto proceed with extensions and developments either already authorised or proposed below.    The BBC have reported that, by making special economies, they will - on certain assumptions - beable to do so until January 1968 rat least when they would need anincrease of  1.- 2 -
11.    In order to make these special econom.es, the BBC willrestrict activities which they have hitherto considered welljustified hut which, against the background of continuedfinancial stringency, can be sacrificed to the overridingnational need for economy.   The Corporation have conducted asearching examination of all their ancillary services and operations, with a view to making the maximum retrenchment indetail.   By itself, however, this will not suffice.    Some larger scale projects, desirable in themselves, for enlarging andmodernising the Corporations programme production capacity, willbe forgone for the present.   But the BBC will be able to maintain their present level of programme output and to proceed withextensions and developments of their services already authorisedor about to be authorised.licence evasion12,    One assumption on which the BBC have based their undertaking to manage without an immediate increase in the licence fee is thatcounter measures against licence evasion will prove effective.    Ithas been reliably estimated that, of the gross revenue amounting tosome  80n. payable in a full year, some  9m. is lost throughevasion.    This is far too much to be tolerated.   Honest viewersand listeners are, in effect, paying for the dishonesty of theevaders.13.    Steps have already been taken by the Postmaster General to tighten up counter evasion measures, but, by themselves, they willnot suffice.   Further measures are required.    The Government arereviewing the penalties which Magistrates may impose on convictedevaders, and are discussing with the associations representingretailers and the rental companies ways in which dealers could helpin the enforcement of the licence system.    The Government willannounce their proposals as soon as these discussions have beencompleted.BBC finance;    conclusionIk.    The Government recognise the efforts which the Corporationare making to defer their request for an increase&apos;in the licence fee.    The increase will be required in due course, but, given the combined effect of the special economies to be secured by the BBC&apos;and of the further measures to be taken to combat licence-evasion,-the Government are satisfied that no increase in the fee will berequired before 1968.
A FOURTH TELE&apos;VISION SERVICE15.   Ultima-bely, the frequencies now available for television couldaccommodate six services of near-national coverage on the 625-linedefinition standard; two in the very high frequency (VHF) bands;and four in the ultra-high frequency (UHF) bands.   At present, theVHF bands are occupied by BBC.1 and independent television, bothbroadcast on ^05-lines.    Of the four 625-line networks possible inUHF, one is committed to BBC,2.    There is therefore unused frequencyspace in the UHF bands for three more 625-line services.    Space for two of them must be reserved in case it is required in order to change over the existing 1+05-line services to 625-lines by theduplication method.    This means that the present basis on which planning must proceed is that, for the next 10 to 15 years,frequencies will certainly be available for only one additionaltelevision service of near-national coverage, in UHF and on625-lines.16.   When the Television Act 1963 was before Parliament, theGovernment of the day stated their intention to allocate this service to a second programme of independent television during 1963unless the financial or other obstacles were insurmountable.However it were allocated, a fourth television service would makelarge demands on resources.    The three main services of televisionalready provide a large volume of programmes of various kinds andthe Government do not consider that another television service canbe afforded a high place in the order of national priorities.17.   Moreover, before deploying the last frequencies certainlyavailable for television for many years to come, the Governmentwould need to be satisfied that the case for committing them to any new service had been fully established. /Besides the claim of independent television, there is also the possibility that the frequencies would be required for a specialised service of educational television./18.    The Government have decided that no allocation of frequenciesto a fourth television service will be authorised for the next threeyears at any rate.COLOUR TELEVISION19.    The Government have already announced the decision that colour television, using the PAL transmission system and the 625-linedefinition standard should be provided.   The service is to starttowards the end of next year on BBC.2,    In reaching this conclusion the Government saw a,s an important consideration the prospect ofincreasing exports - provided that an early start could be made.20.    In making this announcement, the Postmaster General stated thatif the Oslo conference of the International Radio consultative committee were to show that another transmission system found general acceptance, the Government would take such a development intoconsideration.   In the event, the conference did not reach a commonview on any transmission system.    In general, the countries of western Europe expressed a preference for the PAL system, andFrance and eastern Europe for the SSCAM II system.    Accordingly,in the United Kingdom the colour service will be provided on the PALsystem.21.    It has always been recognised that the decision to provide colour television on the 625-line definition standard is dependent upon theintention to charge over the two k05-line services of BBC.1 and independent television - to 625-lines.    The Postmaster General&apos;sTelevision Advisory Committee has been asked to report as soon aspossible on the method of changeover to be adopted..- k.-
, 22o    It is the Government1s view that the cost of colour programmes,which are likely at the outset to be available only to a small minority of viewers because of the cost of receivers, should not fall upon viewers in general.    Accordingly a supplementary licence fee of  5 will be required from those equipped to receive colourprogrammes.LOCAL SOUND BROADCASTING23.    No general service of local sound broadcasting can be provided on medium wavelengths allotted to the United Kingdom.   The onlypossibility for such a service would be VHF .    This would give atypical station a range of about 5 miles,    In practical terms $150-200 towns and cities could be served.    Of the proposals put tothe Government for the provision of a service, some advocate thatit should be provided by commercial companies and financed fromthe Sale by them of advertising tine, others that it should beprovided by the BBC.2k,    In a worthwhile service of bradcasting a local station should,the Pilkington Committee concluded, transmit &quot;for a sufficient part:of the broadcasting day, ^/material/ of particular interest to the locality served by that station rather than to other localities&quot;.In their White Paper of July 1962 (Cmnd,1770) the previous administration agreed &quot;that the justification for local sound broadcasting would be the provision of a service genuinely &quot;local&apos;in character&quot;.    The Government share this view.25,   But there is not only the question whether such a servicecould be sustained, month-in, month-out; there is also the questionwhether there would be a continuing public demand for it.    There isno clear evidence either that adequate local material is available or that the need for such a service exists.    The Government there-fore feel that an experiment is necessary.26c    In considering the possible form of an experiment which shouldlast no longer and be no more extensive than is necessary to providethe information on which to found a decision whether or not toproceed to a general and permanent service, the Government have had regard to the need to aroid setting up at this stage any newbroadcasting structure.    They have also had to bear in mind theneed to avoid an excessive diversion of resources for this purpose.This latter consideration would be equally important whether the experiment were undertaken by the BBC, a new corporation or by commercial undertakings.    They have decided to authorise the BBC to conduct a nine-station experiment, on &quot;VHF .    The objective is that the stations should offer a full-scale local service during the experimental period.    The Corporation would expect to bring the firststation into service by the Spring; and to have three stations in service by the Autumn of 1967.    A two-year experiment from then wouldprovide the information on which to found the final decision.27*   For each experimental station there will be a Local BroadcastingCouncil appointed, by the Postmaster General in consultation with the bbc.   Each Council will be widely representative of the community -including youth - and will play a fully formative part in thedevelopment of programme policy and content.   The Government attach great importance to the need to ensure that the stations are local in character and not all moulded to a common pattern imposed from thecentre; and the BBC have assured the Government that the Councilswill have the maximum possible voice in the direction and performance of the stations,    The Corporation will accommodate the cost of the experiment within the expenditure limit required by the decision thatthe licence fee will remain unchanged at least until 1st January 1968,- 5 -

28.   The Government reserve until the conclusion of the experimentany decision on the question whether a general or permanent service should be authorised, and, if so, how it should be constituted and organised and by whom provided.    The decision that the BBC should conduct the experiment implies no commitment that the corporation should provide a permanent service, if it were decided to authoriseone./29.- 6 -
A^CQNTINUOUS J^USIC^SERVICl29.    The demand for continuous light music is not new.    What is newis that, by appropriating wavelengths allotted to other countries,the pirate radio stations have been able to exploit it.    legislation to end the activities of these stations has been introduced and thedemand for a continuous service of music will be met by the BBC.Until recently, the Corporation have considered that they could bestserve their various audiences by providing the Light Programme inits present form on both long and medium-wavelengths.    The long-wavetransmission of the Light Programme is now reinforced by the BBC&apos;sVHP transmissions, which themselves are attaining virtually completepopulation coverage.    Moreover, portable VHF  transistor sets, at reasonable cost, are now becoming available.    For these reasons, the bbc now feel free to devote the medium-wave channel of 2h7 metresto a service of continuous light music.    This means that theCorporation will provide music during those day-time hours when thelong-wave and VHF transmitters of the Light Programme are broadcastingprogrammes other than music.    The Government welcome this extensionof choice offered by the BBC to the listener,PAY TV30.    The Conservative Government authorised an experiment to last three years and granted a licence which will not expire beforeJanaary 1969o    The Government agree with this decision lov.i they willnot allow a situation to develop in which the vast majority ofviewers are denied the viewing of major sporting events.HOURS OF BROADCASTING31.    The first White Paper (Cmnd.1770) on the report of the pilkington Committee stated that the Postmaster General&apos;s powers tocontrol the hours of broadcasting would continue.    In the TelevisionAct 1963? and in the BBC&apos;s Licence and Agreement, approved byParliament in January 196*4-* these powers were re-enacted in a more detailed form.32.    It has been represented to the Government that, ideally,  these powers should not be used, but held as a reserve povi/er.    Both, theITA and the BBC would then be free to broadcast for as many hours aday as they chose.    The Government have also considered whether,instead,  there might be authorised a large increase in the numberof hours of broadcasting a week.33&quot;    In a typical week BBC.1,  independent television and. BBC. 2broadcast for some 180 to 200 hours in total.    The amount of television broadcast here compares favourably with that of any other western European country and considerably exceeds that of most.34&quot; In the Government&apos;s view, the amount of broadcasting time willremain a matter of sufficient social importance to require that thePostmaster General should continue to hold and exercise his present powers of control. Nor do the Government consider that any general increase in broadcasting hours will be justifiable for the present.They do not, however, rule out the possibility of more time for educational programmes.THE BROADCASTING AUTHORITIES:      THYTR COMMONRESl^NSIBILITIES&apos;^&apos; &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;35.o    Both the BBC and ITA are public corporations, wholly responsiblefor the content of their programmes and for the day-to-day conductof their affairs.   The principle that the public corporations shouldbe independent of the Government has been upheld by successiveAdministrations since the beginning of broadcasting in the UnitedKingdom.    The Government adhere to this concept.
- 8 -36,    The Government has discussed with the broadcasting authorities,&apos; and with other parties in Parliament, the idea of establishing,subject to this governing principle, a council to consider general issues of broadcasting policy..   They have concluded that additionalmachinery of this sort would serve little useful purpose if theindependence of the two public corporations is to be maintained.Since full responsibility is required of them, they must be affordedfull authority to secure that their services are conducted in thegeneral interest,37,   Though Parliament has placed them in competition with eachother, they have a common objective of public service.    In the continuing task of realising this objective matters of common concernare bound to arise.    To discuss matters of this kind, the Chairmanof the BBC and the Chairman of the ITA have, the Government understandestablished regular and frequent meetings.   The two broadcasting authorities have now decided to put these meetings on a more formalfooting and to use them as the occasion for discussing matters whicheither Chairman might wish to raise.    The meetings will continue tobe private and unpublicised.38. The Government welcome this means of consultation betv/een thetwo authorities and their ready recognition that they will benefit from an understanding by each authority of the other&apos;s views.
