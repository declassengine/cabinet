US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66)14012th October, 1966CABINETPRICE OF INDUSTRIAL coal memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic affairs have to submit for decision by the Cabinet an issue arising onthe price of industrial coal, about which the Ministerial Committee on prices and Incomes were unable to reach agreement at their meeting on tuesday, 11th October.2.      Last year the National Coal Board put forward proposals for increases in coal prices, including the price of industrial coal.     Theoperation of these increases was deferred while they were investigated by the National Board for Prices and Incomes,    The National Board for prices and Incomes approved the proposals of the National Coal Board,and last March the Cabinet approved increases in the price of industrialcoal to come into effect from 1st April, 1966 (CC(66) 16th Conclusions,Minute 5).    The majority of the National Coal board&apos;s industrialcustomers have been paying the higher price since last April;  but anumber of customers are supplied under contracts which require sixmonths&apos; notification of price increases.    In these cases notification wasduly given last April, and the increased prices were due to come intoeffect from 1st October, 1966.    It was not clear at our meeting whether any of these customers had in fact begun to pay at the new rates;  it was thought that some might have done.    The question now is whether weshould ask the National Coal Board to defer the introduction of thehigher prices on these contracts until 1st January, 1967, after the initialstandstill period.3.       The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Power, andother Ministers, consider that we should not seek to defer the intro-duction of higher prices on these remaining industrial contracts anyfurther.    They support this view with the following arguments:(a)    The Government have advised the Confederation of BritishIndustry that the standstill does not mean that there should be inter-ference with existing contracts.    It is argued that these particularprice increases clearly fall within this category.
(b) The majority of the National Coal Boardls industrial customers,whose contracts did not contain a requirement for six months&apos; notifica-tion of increases, have been paying the new rates since 1st April,,    Itis argued that this case is analogous to that of a group of workers,covered by an agreement for a wage increase to come into effect before20th July, some of whom were already receiving the increase before the standstill was announced while others had not begun to receive theincrease by that date.    In that case we decided that the rest of thegroup should receive their increases notwithstanding the standstill;it is suggested that we should follow that analogy in this case.(c) As a result of the delay in approving the National Coal Board&apos;original proposals, the Coal Board had a deficit last year of  25million, which the Exchequer had to meet.    Further deferment of theincrease in price of industrial coal under these contracts for a periodof three months would cost a further  2 million to  3 million, whichthe Exchequer would have to meet.    Apart from the immediate cost,it is argued that this would reduce the incentive to the National coal board to get their finances straight following last yearrs financialreorganisation.(d) If the increase of price under the remaining contracts is notdeferred, it comes into effect, without any new decision or action orannouncement being required, in accordance with the notifications given sixmonths ago.    It might well thus rouse no public attention.    A decisionto defer the increases, on the other hand, would require positive action by the Government, in file form of a request to the National coal board.    The National Coal Board are known to consider that they are under no obligation to consult the Government on this matter, and theymight well require a statutory direction under the Prices and incomes act, since it would be difficult to justify the further deferment to thosecustomers who have already been paying the higher prices for sixmonths.4,       The Minister of Labour and I, and other Ministers, see theforce of these arguments.    The fact remains, however, that we are trying to maintain a prices and incomes standstill, against a background of suspicions, particularly in the trade union movement, that we areenforcing the standstill more rigorously upon wages than upon prices and that the nationalised industries are in some way being exempted from the standstill in respect of their prices.    We think that failure to require the National Coal Board to defer these increases would feedthese suspicions.    The Cabinet&apos;s decision on groups (paragraph 3(b)above) was related only to incomes;  the Cabinet did not consider theapplication of a similar doctrine to prices.    We believe that failure toact in this case could not escape notice, and would be bound to makeit more difficult to maintain the standstill on incomes.    We considerthat the need to protect the standstill is so strong as to over-ride thearguments for going ahead with the price increases, even at a cost of 2 million to  3 million to the Exchequer.-2-
conclusion.       The Cabinet are asked to decide whether the Minister of Poweshould be invited to request the National Coal Board to defer until 1st January, 1967, the industrial coal price changes notified underprivately negotiated contracts to come into operation on 1st October,19660M.
