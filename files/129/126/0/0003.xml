V/e could have resortedto a sharp deflation, just as the Conservatives did in the balance ofpayments crises of the fifties and early sixties.    But the cost, interms of the extra unemployment that would have been created and theblow that would have struck at industry&apos;s confidence and hence at itswill to expand and modernise (to the future disadvantage of the balanceof payments), would have been heavy and quite contrary to our electoralmandate.2.       It was therefore necessary for us to find an alternative strategy.The strategy that we chose did in fact embody as one of its elementsthe curtailment of internal demand, by means of monetary and fiscalrestraints, in order to induce a shift of resources into export production;but for the sake of preventing damage both to productive investment andto the level of employment, this line of policy has been pressedmoderately and, to the extent possible, selectively.     To promote the recovery of the balance of payments we relied to a large extent on measures which v/ould save or earn foreign currency directty and on a comprehensive programme for accelerating the rate of productivitygrowth and for moderating the rate of increase in money incomes.    were recognised, of course, that this approach would take time to showresults;  but I hoped that the deficit could be eradicated within a periodof about two years, mat is, by the end of 1966, and accordingly that itwould not be imprudent to enter into large-scale international borrowingto finance the deficit in the interim.3.       In conformity with this strategy, the measures that we announced in the final quarter of 1964 embraced both direct action on the externalbalance (the temporary import charge and the export rebate) and - to offset the effect on demand of these steps and of the improvement in social benefits that we announced concurrently - some general fiscaland monetary restrictions (increased income tax, increased duties onpetrol and oil and a request to the banks to restrain the growth of theirlending).    At this time we took the view that there was no unduepressure of demand on resources.    But during the spring and summer of last year it became apparent that the expansionary forces at workin the economy were stronger than had earlier been supposed.    Hencein the April Budget of 1965 I increased indirect taxes and shortly-1-C(66) 1038th July, 1966
afterwards imposed a ceiling on bank advances.    In July we cut backcertain public investment projects, foreshadowed the introduction ofbuilding licensing, restricted hire purchase and further tightenedExchange Control.    Earlier in the year we had announced our programme for restraining the year-to-year advance of public expenditure.4.       By the end of last year it was plain that our policies had achieved a considerable measure of success.    In the first place, the balance ofpayments deficit, at some  350 million over the year as a whole, was less than half what it had been in 1964, (although a considerable improve-ment was expected to take place in any event).    While the improvementwas partly the result of the temporary import charge and of the cutting down of the capital outflow, it also reflected an export performanceappreciably better than on average over the preceding decade.    Weachieved a much needed shift in the use of our resources.    comparing the second half of 1965 with a year earlier, consumer spending in real terms was up only 1 per cent, whereas exports (of goods and services)were up 6 per cent;  and - as we had hoped and intended - manufacturinginvestment remained at a high level.5.       However, it was also evident by the end of last year that while our policies had brought about a better use of resources they had stillleft the pressure on resources at an uncomfortably high level.     Therate of unemployment, which broadly measures this pressure, remainedvery low throughout the year at under lj? per cent.    Part of the explanation is that although the rate of increase in demand and activity was successfully moderated last year, the rate of increase in the capacity of the economy also appears to have slowed down significantlybecause of the cut in working hours associated with the widespread move to a forty-hour week.6,       The extreme tightness of the labour market was undoubtedly oneof the main reasons for the continuance of a very rapid increase in v/age and salary earnings last year - an increase which must have brought a sharp increase in unit labour costs in manufacturing industry at a timewhen an improvement in the United Kingdom&apos;s cost position relative to its competitors is urgently needed.The Present Situation7.       This year there has been a halt to our progress towards easingthe strain on resources and improving the balance of payments.8.       There was a substantial rise in national expenditure in the first quarter of the year.    This was largely, though not entirely, the resultof a very rapid increase in consumers1 expenditure;  this rose by over2 per cent between the fourth quarter of 1965 and the first quarter of1966 compared with an average rate of increase of 3 per cent a yea.rbetween 1961 and 1965.    The bulk of the rise in consumers&apos; expenditurerepresented increased expenditure on cars and alcoholic drink and myinterpretation had been that the increase in spending was in anticipation of increases in tax on these items in the budget and would be subsequentlyreversed.    Partly, no doubt, as a result of this sharp rise in home demand the value of imports increased by 3-1 per cent between the fourth and first quarters,.    The rise in activity also helps to explain whyunemployment continued to fall early in the year.
9.       Later evidence suggests that pre-Budget expenditure will not be reversed as much as had been expected.    In the first half of this year the volume of consumers1 expenditure may well turn out to have been 2to 3 per cent higher than a year earlier, despite the series of measures taken to restrain the growth of consumer demand - the 1965 Budget andtwo rounds of hire purchase restrictions - over the past 12 months.Imports have not fallen back from the first quarter level.    Part of the explanation of the recent high import figures lies in special factorsincluding a sharp rise in import prices; but the volume of imports has risen too and the share of national expenditure met by imports has risenfaster than usual.10.       As is usual in periods of high pressure of demand, v/ages have continued to rise rapidly and current new settlements continue to allow for substantial increases in basic hourly rates.    Gome but not all ofthe increase in consumer purchasing power will be offset from theautumn onwards by the Selective Employment Tax and by the restraintson bank and hire purchase credit.    As a result of the recent substantial increases in wage costs and in addition higher import prices and theSET, retail prices can be expected to continue rising at a considerablerate of 3f to 4 per cent per annum.11.        The development of the balance of payments so far this year hasnot been encouraging.    The deficit in the first quarter of this year was 99 million.    We know from experience that the position fluctuates fromquarter to quarter.    Even so, a discomforting feature is the tendency for the trade deficit to increase again.    In March/May it averaged 24 million a month against a monthly rate of  22 million in 1965 as awhole.    Other partial information on the balance of payments for theperiod since the first quarter suggests that the total deficit was continuing at a high rate.    (See table at Annex for the course of thebalance of payments in recent years, up to and including the first quarter of 1966).12,      After we took  316 million of dollar assets out of theGovernments portfolio and put them into the reserves in February,the reserves stood at  1, 303 million.    They have fallen in each monthsince, to stand at  1,170 million at the end of June,    In addition ourshort-term debt to other central banks has been appreciably increasedagain.    While these reserve movements have been affected by flows of funds (both the build-up of sterling balances by the overseas sterling area and withdrawals of funds by non-sterling holders) much of the recentfall in reserves is attributable to our own continuing deficit.The outlook13,       To tarn from the current situation to the outlook, the latestdetailed forecast of prospects over the next 18 months for both thehome economy and the balance of payments has only just reached me,I have not yet been able to study its preliminary conclusions carefully;but I feel that I should set them dov/n by way of a postscript to this paper, while reminding my colleagues of the vital importance of preserving the strictest secrecy as to their nature.    Granted thatforecasting is still a very inexact art, the picture that emerges is not one to reassure us.-3-
14,       The prospect internally to the end of next year is of continued expansion in output at a moderate rate.    There is likely to be someeasing of the pressure on the economy, but not much.    Unemployment islikely to remain at a low level and wages and prices are likely to risenearly as fast as in the last year.    We can expect continued growth in exports and in public expenditure on current account;  with public investment rising fast, fixed investment in total will also be quite astrong expansionary force.    Personal incomes are likely to go onrising strongly and, notwithstanding the impact of the SET and of therestrictions on credit, consumer spending in real terms must beexpected to advance at an appreciable rate.-15,       So far as the balance of payments is concerned, mere are various disturbing influences which obscure the underlying trend - forexample, the effect of removing the temporary import charge.    against this background, we need to remember that the 1964 drawing from theIMF and loans from Switzerland amounting to  385 million are due for repayment before the end of next year.    Moreover, we have once againa sizeable debt to other central banks falling due in the period to end-1967and the new Basle facilities are not available to finance our deficit.The ready, or near ready, resources we have to fall back on are the reserves of  1,170 million and the portfolio of  190 million;    the strain we can see could well bear heavily on these resources,16,       We face an extremely difficult economic situation.    Despite thevarious doses of disinflation and the prices and incomes policy, the economy remains in an inflationary condition, with labour short, wagesrising fast, and more imports being sucked in.    At the same time wehave not yet succeeded in eliminating the enormous deficit in thebalance of payments that we found on talcing office.    We have reducedit;  but it is still larr;e, nor does it seem to be falling fast enough.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.8th July, 1966
