DRAFT WHITE PAPERPRICES AND INCOM^^AMDSTILLI. INTRODUCTION.1.      In a statement in the House *f Commons on 20th July1966 the Prime Minister drew attention to the fact that money incomes have been increasing at a rate far faster than &amp;ould be justified by increasing production and called for a standstill on pricks and incomes.      Details of theway in which it is proposed that the standstill should beapplied are set out in the paragraphs below,2.      The country needs a breathing space of twelve months in which productivity can catch up with the excessiveincreases in incomes which have been taking place.      the broad intention is to secure in the first six months (whichcan be regarded, for convenience, as the period to the endof December, 1966) a standstill in which increases inprices or in incomes will so far as possible be avoidedaltogether.      The first half of 1967 will be regarded asa period of severe restraint in which some increases in incomes may be justified, where there are particularlycompelling reasons which justify them, but exceptionalrestraint will be needed by all who are concerned withdetermining prices and incomes.
II.    prices.    The introduction of a general standstill on prices and charges until the end of 1966, to he followed by a six-months&apos;period of severe restraint, is intended to apply to prices ofall goods and services whether provided by private or publicenterprise.   All enterprises will be expected to make everyeffort to absorb increases in costs, whatever the circum-stances in which these arise.2,    This standstill period will apply except to the limited extent that increases in prices or charges may be necessary because of marked increases, which cannot be absorbed in whole or in part, in(i)    the cost of imported materials;(ii)    costs arising from changes in supply forseasonal or other reasons;(iii)    costs due to action by the Government, suchas increased taxation.3-    In some instances an enterprise may feel compelled to propose an increase in price where it finds it impracticable to absorb increased costs over which it cannot exercise full control (e.g. manufacturers whose products include a high proportion of bought-in components.)    Any such cases will besubject to the most rigorous scrutiny in the light ofnational economic needs, including the requirements of exporttrade.k-    The criteria for price increases appropriate throughoutthe whole period are thus much more stringent than those setout in the White Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd.2639,Part I, paragraph 9).    The criteria for price reductions setout in the White Paper (ibid, paragraph 10) will still apply.
Type of Price Covered5.     Although, the paragraphs above relate primarily to manufacturers&apos; prices for the home market, the same general considerations apply to prices charged by wholesalers aridretailers, who are expected, in common with manufacturers, todo everything possible to avoid any increases in their prices by increasing efficiency and, in particular by avoiding any increases in their cash margins.Early Warning Arrange^ment^s   or the Per^ds^pX^Severe Restraint6.     The early warning arrangements at present in force are tocontinue.     * But the Government considers it essential that theyshould be extended to cover a wider field of items and will beconsulting the C.B.I. and other interested organisations about this.7.     The standstill is to apply equally, however, to goods and services within and outside the present early warning scheme.Any manufacturing enterprise, other than one to which the exceptions in paragraph 8 below apply, which considers that itis justified in proposing a price increase on the grounds setout in paragraphs 2 and 3 above should notify the appropriateGovernment Department.     It will be expected to make no increasein price without receiving written confirmation from the Govern-ment that no further standstill on the increase is required.8.     Prior notification is not required:-(a)      in respect of increases in prices of the fooditems listed in Part B of the Appendix of Cmnd.2808 which will continue to be kept under constantwatch by the Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food in accordance with the terms of/paragraph* White Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy:An &quot;Early Warning System&quot; (Cmnd. 2808)
SECRETparagraph 5 of Cmnd. 2808.(b)   from enterprises which are not included in the early-warning arrangements and which employ less than $00?workers.Referenceg, jbo,,th.e Wational Board.,..for,JPrices,and.Jhicomes9.     The Government will refer proposals for price increasesduring the periods of standstill and severe restraint inappropriate cases to the National Board for Prices and Incomesfor examination and report.     The Board will be required toreport as soon as possible.     The enterprise concerned will beexpected to defer the increase until the Board has reported,and in the light of the Board&apos;s recommendations will beexpected to continue to hold the price unchanged until theend of the twelve months.
Rents10.    The level of rents charged by landlords for virtually thewhole of the private housing sector is already determinedwithin the statutory framework of the Rent Acts, but theGovernment will keep the movement of rents of private housingunder close watch.^Local authority rents are already on a non-profit making and subsidised basis.    If increased costs are not met fromrents they must be recouped from rates which are also a charge on tenants, local authority tenants paying the two - rent and rates - in a single payment.    In these circumstances theimposition of a general standstill would be inappropriate.In the period, of the prices standstill until the end of 1966the Government expect local authorities to take suchpractical steps as are possible to prevent rent increases.Where increases are unavoidable, the Government hope that local authorities will make provision for the protection of tenants of limited means through rent rebate schemes.    similar considerations apply to rents of houses provided by other public authorities, e.g. New Towns77&quot;Raters11.    Local rates are a form of taxation, although they alsoenter into the cost of living, and are necessary to finance the whole range of services to the residents of the areaprovided by the local authority.    Local authorities have been urged to ensure all proper economies in expenditure.Rents of Business, jgreKiises and of Agricultural Land/12.    In calling for a standstill on the prices of goods and services, the Government recognise that increases in the rents of business premises and of agricultural land have an effect on prices of goods and services,,    The principles ofthe standstill are expected to apply to all such rents no less than to the prices of goods and services and landlordsshould take them fully into account J/PrLce^s
/T3.    The prices of houses, both new and existing, are determined in almost all cases by individual negotiation between buyer andseller, or by auction,,    The standstill,    therefore, does notsimilar arrangements reflect the general level of interest rates and it would be inappropriate to apply the principles ofthe standstill to them.    It will be open to the Government,however, under the Prices and Incomes Bill to refer any such charges to the National Board for Prices and Incomes for examination and report but without imposition of a standstill^/appropriately apply to such transactions^/Mortgages, Bank Overdrafts and Hire Purchase/Th..

III. INCOMES1.     As explained in para. 2 it is the G-overnment&apos; s intention that there should be a standstill on all forms of incomeup to the end of 1966, followed by a six-month period of severe restraint,-IffJjlox^ij^JL J- n c o me s2.     The standstill is intended to apply to increases in pay and to reductions in working hours.      It is not proposedthat the standstill should be regarded as applying to other conditions of service, except in so far as these are likelyto add significantly to labour costs.3.      The term &quot;increases in pay&quot; itself requires definition.Broadly it is intended to cover arrangements which have theeffect either of increasing the remuneration payable for a given amount of work or of reducing the amount of workfor which a given level of remuneration is payable.      Onthis basis  &quot;pay&quot; includes in addition to basic pay, rates*f allowances which are in the nature of pay, rates of pay for overtime and week-end working, piece rates, etc.A.      It is not intended that the standstill should beregarded as applying to:-(i) Increases in payments made in specific compen-sation for expenditure incurred, e.g. travel and subsistence allowances,(ii) Increases in pay resulting directly from increased output, e.g. piece-work earnings,commissions on sales, any necessary increases/&quot;&quot;in over-time, profit-sharing schemes^ etc.SECRET
(iii) Increases in pay genuinely resulting frompromotion to work at a higher level, whether withthe same or a different employer.      (On the otherhand the intention of the standstill would hedefeated if employers were to regrade posts as aconcealed method of increasing rates of pay.)(iv) It is net&apos;intended that the standstill should inter-fere with the normal arrangements for increasingpay either with age, as with apprentices orjuveniles, or by means of regular increments of specified amounts within a predetermined range orscale.      SUch arrangements are equivalent topromotion according to age or experience;   nor doincrements as such add to the total wage bill.They can thus be distinguished from a commitment to increase pay for a group of employees as awhole, which is affected by the standstill.Existing commitments5.     At the time of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement at least6 million workers - approximately one worker in three - wasexpecting an increase in pay or a reduction in hours (or both) during the next twelve months as the result of along-term agreement or other type of settlement made atsome time in the past.      It would clearly have been impossible to introduce a standstill on incomes whileallowing these existing commitments to go ahead unchecked.Apart from the unfairness to other workers for whom no suchfuture commitment at present exists,  it would in practicehave been bound to jeopardise the effectiveness of the standstill from the outset.
6.      On the other hand the Government is deeply conscious of the need to restrict to the minimum compatible with the wider economic interests of the country any interferencewith obligations freely entered into by employers and workers or their representatives.      In the present excep-tionally difficult circumstances the Government thinks it right to call upon all concerned to accept some defermentof the implementation of any definite commitment to increasepay or shorten hours entered into before the beginning ofthe standstill.      It is accordingly proposed that thefollowing types of commitment,  if entered into on or before20th July 1966 but not yet implemented should be deferred by six months from the original operative dates-(a) agreements to increase pay or shorten hourswhether from an operative date before or after20th July, 1966;(b) pay increases which may be due under cost of livingsliding scale arrangements between 20th July 1966and 30th June 1967;(c) commitments to revievir pay or hours from a datealready agreed on or before 20th July 1966 orstanding commitments for periodic review;(d) Wages Council proposals made on or before 20th Julybut not yet submitted to the Minister of Labour orsubmitted to the Minister but not yet embodied ina statutory order.7.     An existing commitment may be defined as any agreement to increase pay or shorten hours or any offer to do so whichhas been firmly accepted by or on behalf of the workers concerned on or before 20th July, 1966./a.
8.      It would clearly defeat the intention of the standstillif the parties concerned were to seek to make good in subse-quent negotiations any increases foregone as a result of the standstill.      Similarly the deferment of existing commitmentsnecessarily involves the deferment of retrospective dateswhere these apply.New- AgregjiLents^9.      It is not the intention that negotiations should bebarred during the standstill period to the end of 1966.    but no new agreements entered into after 20th July, 1966 shouldtake effect before 1st January, 1967 at the earliest andshould not take effect in the following six months unless they can be justified as falling within the revised criteriaset out in para.10 below.10.    During the six months period of severe restraint(i.e. the first six months of 1967) ike criteria for consider:tion of new proposals for improvements in pay and hours willbe much more stringent than those set out in Part I of theWhite Paper (Cmnd.2639) and for the time being the incomesnorm must be regarded as zero.     The guiding principle must   &apos;be that of national economic and. social priorities.      it follows that even in cases which satisfy these more stringentcriteria only limited improvements are likely to be justifiedduring the period of severe restraint.      The Government willbe consulting the C.B.I., T.U.C. and other interested parties on the form which these new and stringent criteriashould take in order to secure the restraint which thenational interest demands.11.    The Government intend that the fullest use should bemade of the National Board for Prices and Incomes in the examination of proposals for improvements which the partiesconsider to be justified in accordance with the new criteria.
12.    In order that those groups which have an expectation of improvement under commitments already existing should not he treated more severely than those which do not,  it will heopen to the parties to existing commitments to renegotiate,subject to the standstill, their agreements to take effectduring the following six months period of severe restraint in accordance with the new criteria.Arbitration13.    Arbitrators, no less than the other parties involvedin negotiations or industrial disputes, are expected to conform to the requirements of the national interest in reaching their decisions;    and arbitration awards, likesettlements negotiated voluntarily, are intended to besubject to the requirements of the periods of stand still and severe restraint.Pay in the-jp^l^ic--secj-or1h.    Employers and workers in the public services andpublicly-owned undertakings will be regarded as under thesame obligations to act in accordance with these require-ments as the rest of the community.Other .forfflg--Of employment income15.    Many individual salaries and other forms of remunera-tion including that of company directors and seniorexecutives are fixed outside the normal process of collective bargaining;    but it is intended that the same principles should apply to these as to other forms of income.    It isintended to incorporate in a Companies Bill for introduction in the current session of Parliament the statutory require-ments relating to disclosure by companies of emaluments ofdirecters and senior executives, to which the Prime minister referred in his statement on 20th July.
Footnote (i):    The tax rules applying to &quot;closely controlled companies&quot; may make it necessary to excludesuch companies&apos; distributions from the standstill.1 6*   Other money incomes^/&quot;The Government have already pledged themselves to use their fiscal powers or other appropriate means to prevent any excessive growth in aggregate profits.All company distributions including dividends paid by companies are subject to the standstill for twelve months and should not be increased above the average level paidin the period ...............    (i)It is recognised that there may be a very few cases in which itwould be in accordance with the national interest to permitan increased distribution, but the Government will requirestrict examination of any such cases^Companies are requested to inform the Government/Treasury ofsuch cases in order that the justification may be examined.In important cases the Government would refer the matter tothe N.B.P.I. for examination.17.     The incomes of self-employed persons, including all forms of professional fees, are expected to be under similarrestraint over the twelve months.   The Government will havepower under the Prices and Incomes Bill to impose a standstill on charges made for professional services^

PUBLIC SECTOR1 Prices, Charges and Fees of Government DepartmentsI l,     /The Government intend to apply the principles of theJ standstill to all prices, charges and fees of GovernmentI Departments^I Nationalised Industries2.     /Jfhe nationalised industries will be subject to the samerestraints as the private sector in relation to prices and incomes.    They will be subject also to the general provisions of the Prices and Incomes Bill.    The chairmen of the nationalised industries have assured the Governmentof their full support in implementing the standstill.The Air Transport Licensing Board, which has before itapplications from British European Airways for increases in fares on the London-Scottish air routes, has assured the Government that it will take the Prime Minister&apos;sStatement of 20th July into account before reaching adecision^statute ry Price-F1 xiinjg-J3odie s3.     /jStatutorily established price-fixing bodies, suchas the Transport Tribunal or the Traffic Commissioners,are expected to conform to the requirements of the periods of standstill and severe restraint^
V .    NATIONAL BOARD FOR PRICES AND INCOMES27.    The Government, the C.B.I. and the T.U.C. attach greatimportance to the continuation of the work of the national board for Prices and Incomes, both in the longer-term and inthe special circumstances of the standstill.28.    The Board will be responsible during the twelve monthsf or considering, in accordance with the above arrangements,such proposals for prices and incomes increases as are referred to it for detailed examination.    The Board&apos;sexaminations will be carried out as rapidly as possible andIts organisation will be adcipted and strengthened as necessaryfor this purpose.29.    The Board will continue during the next twelve months to examine references made to it from time to time by theGovernment on matters of longer term significance in thefield of productivity, prices and incomes.    This will be ofparticular importance in preparing for the period following the standstill and period of severe restraint when it will be essential to ensure that the growth of incomes is resumed ina manner consistent with the growth of national output.V]. PROPOSED STATUTORY POWERS^Section to follow7
VI......PROPOSED STATUTORY powers in his statement on 20th July the Prime Minister said:-&quot;within the main field of collective bargainingwe shall rely in the first instance on voluntaryaction,   Nevertheless, in order to ensure that theselfish do not benefit at the expense of those whoco-operate, it is our intention to strengthen theprovisions of the Prices and Incomes Bill.  .......Meanwhile the Government will not hesitate to actwithin the powers they enjoy, or may further seek,to deal with any action involving increases outside and beyond this policy.&apos;1&apos;2.     For this purpose the Government proposed to move theaddition to the Bill of new clauses containing purely temporary provisions which would be operative from the date on which theAct comes into force but which would lapse automatically aftertwelve months without power of renewal.3,     The proposed provisions will:-(a)    give the Government power to make orders (subject tonegative resolution by both Houses of Parliament) directing thatsuch prices or charges, or rates of remuneration, as may be specified in the order shall not be increased from the date on which the order takes effect without Ministerial consent.These powers would enable the Government to impose atemporary standstill on both prices and charges and onlevels of remuneration (allowing for the effect of changesin normal working hours) where this was necessary.   any organisation or person wishing to raise prices or pay thatare subject to the standstill will first have to obtain theconsent of the Government.
give the Government power to enable price or pay increasesimplemented since 20th July which are unjustified to hereversed where this is necessary.       The appropriate minister would be empowered to direct that any price or charge specified in the direction should bo reduced to a level not lower than that prevailing on or before 20th July.Such prices or charges would then not be able subsequently to be raised to a level higher than that specified in thedirection without Ministerial consent.   But before making any such direction, the Minister would be obliged to givelk days&apos; notice to the person to be affected by the order and to consider any representations made within that time.The direction itself could not be retrospective.   A similarpower in respect of rates of pay waald enable the Governmentto require by order that any remuneration of a kind described in the order should be no higher than the rate paid by the employer for the same kind of work before 20th July, or higheronly to an extent authorised in the order, without Governmentapproval.   Before such an order was made lk days&apos; noticewould have to be given and account taken of any represen-tations made by employers or trade unions or other personsaffested by the order.The sanctions for offences.against any order or direct-ion made under these powers will be the same as the sanctionsfor offences under clauses 11 and 16 of the Bill.   Procecd-ings would., as in the case of offences under Part II of theBill, require the consent of the Attorney General.Trade unions and employees would have the statutoryprotection conferred by Clause 16 (5) and (6) andClause 17 in Part II of the Bill.
(c)    to empower the Minister of Labour to delay the operative date of wages regulation orders made under the Wages ConcilsAct 1959, and to vary the effective date of pay increases under orders already made;(d,)    to empower the Minister of Agriculture (and the Secretaryof State for Scotland) to defer the effective date of wagesregulation orders made by the Agricultural Wages Boards underthe Agricultural Wages Act 19^.8.(e)   protect from any legal proceedings employers who, in response to the GovernEBnt&apos;s request for a standstill, voluntarilywithholds pay increases to which an employee may beentitled under his contract of employment,h.     As explained above, these powers would be of a purely temporary nature.    The Prime Minister Ejade it clear in his state-ment that it was not proposed to introduce elaborate statutorycontrols over incomes and prices, and that the policy must continueto rely on voluntary co-operation.   Even though the temporarynew powers will be used very selectively,  they need to bepotentially wide-ranging if they are effectively to deter anyselfish minority who are not prepared to co-operate and to reassure the majority who -are prepared voluntarily to observe thepolicy laid down in the White Paper.27th July, 1966
In his Statement on 20th July asking for a prices and incomes standstill, the Prime Minister said:-&quot;within the main field of collective bargainingwe shall rely in the first instance on voluntaryaction.    Nevertheless, in order to ensure that theselfish do not benefit at the expense of those whoco-operate, it is our intention to strengthen theprovisions of the Prices and Incomes Bill, to speedits passage through Parliament and to redefine the role of the National Board for Prices and Incomes.Meanwhile the Government will not hesitate to actwithin the powers they enjoy, or may further seek,to deal with any action involving increases outside and beyond this policy.&quot;2.     At the first meeting of the Standing Committee onthe Bill on 26th July, the First Secretary announced thatthe Government proposed to proceed by adding a newPart IV to the Bill containing purely temporary provisions which would lapse automatically after twelve months andwould not be subject to renewal.   He undertook to tablethe new clauses as soon as possible,3.      One possible amendment to the Bill which has beenconsidered by the Government is a temporary provision, toextend the 30 days &apos;barly warning&quot;period in Part II of theBill to six months, and to extend the three, months standstillperiod pending investigation by the National Board for prices and Incomes to six months, so that the maximumstandstill period on any proposed price increase oraward or settlement could be twelve months.    But this would effectively destroy the existing philosophy of Fart ii of the Bill, since the intention would be to use the&apos;barly warning&quot;provisions to impose a general standstillrather than to enable the Government to consider whetherparticular proposals should be referred to the Board and,if so, to enable their implementation to be deferred pending the Board&apos;s report./MoreoverPRICES AND INCOMES BILLNew Clauses to Support the General Standstill
SECRET *        183Moreover, an amendment on these lines would be unlikely toprovide an effective deterrent to the minority of persons who arenot prepared to observe the standstill on a voluntary basis.Even if the need to bring in an Order in Council requiring statu-tory consultation and affirmative resolutions by both Houses ofParliament was to be waived during the next twelve months, theprovisions in Part II of the Bill could not be used to reverseprice or pay increases implemented since 20th July but whichcannot be justified under the criteria to be set out in theWhite Paper.   Reliance on the provisions of Part II to reinforce the general standstill would also be likely to undermine the goodwill which now -exists in operating an &quot;early warning&quot; system on a voluntary basis, as well as encouraging people to put for-ward new price or pay proposals sooner than they would otherwise have done.   For these various reasons the Government have con-cluded that the best course is to leave Part II of the Bill intactas a longer term measure and to take separate but temporary powers for the purpose of reinforcing the voluntary standstill.A..     The new powers which it is proposed to take would be effect-ive from the date on which the Act comes into force.    This contrastswith the powers in Part II of the Bill which can only be used after an Order in Council involving affirmative resolutions by both.Houses of Parliament,    This is essential since the new powers arerequired to reinforce a voluntary standstill which has already begun.    The new powers will however lapse automatically twelvemonths after the passing of the Act and will not be subject torenewal.5.     The provision 4jci the new Part IV of the Bill will give theFirst Secretary power to make orders (subject to negative resolution by both Houses) directing that such prices or charges,or rates of remuneration, as may be specified in the order shallnot be increased from the date on which the order takes effectwithout Ministerial consent.    These powers will enable the/Government
Government to impose a temporary standstill on both prices and charges and on levels of remuneration (allowing for the effectof changes in normal working hours) on a more or less selectivebasis.   Any organisation or person wishing to raise prices orpay that are subject to the standstill will first have to obtainthe consent of the First Secretary 01* the appropriate Minister.6.     The power to impose stand stills will not be retrospectiveto 20th July.   Further powers are therefore needed to enableprice or pay increases implemented since 20th July which areunjustified to be reversed where this is necessary.   these further powers will enable any Minister to direct that any pricecharge specified in the direction shall be reduced to a level notlower than that prevailing on or before 20th July.    Such prices or charges shall not subsequently be raised to a level higherthan that specified in the direction without Ministerial consent.Before making any such direction,  the Minister must give lh days&apos;notice to the person to be affected by the order and must consi-der any representations he may make within that time.   Thedirection itself will not be retrospective.7.     There will be a similar power on the pay side.    Thiswill enable the First Secretary to require by order that anyremuneration of a kind described in the order shall be no higherthan the rate paid by the employer for the same kind of workbefore 20th July, or higher only to an extent authorised inthe order, unless the appropriate Minister consents to anincrease above this leveiL./Before
Before making such an order the First Secretary shall give1k days&apos; notice published in the Gazette and shall take accountof any representations made by employers or trade unions orother persons affected by the order within that period.      Theorder itself will not be retrospective, i.e,, it will not affect payments made above the level on 20th July before theorder comes into force.8.      The sanctions for offences against any order or directionmade under these powers will be the same as the sanctions for offences under clauses 11 and 16 of the Bill.     Proceedingswould, as in the case of offences under Part II of the Bill,require the consent of the Attorney General.      Trade unions and employees would have the statutory protection conferred by Clause 16 (5) and (6) and Clause 17 in Part II of the Bill.9.     To enable a standstill to be imposed on minimum rates of pay determineduider statutory negotiating  &quot;achinery, it willalso be necessary:-(a) to empower the Minister of Labour to delay the operative date of wages regulation orders madeunder the &quot;Wages Councils Act 1959? and to vary the effective date of pay increases under orders already made;(b) to empower the Minister of Agriculture (and theSecretary of State for Scotland) to defer the effective date of wages regulation orders made bythe Agricultural Wages Boards under theAgricultural Wages Act 19k8.These p-owers would lapse automatically at the end of the twelve months period.10.    Finally, it is necessary for the Bill to protect fromany legal proceedings employers who, in response to theGovernments request for a standstill, voluntarily withholdpay increases to which an employee may be entitled under his contract of employment.
11.     Although these new powers are potentially far-reaching,they are of a purely temporary nature.      The Prime minister made it clear in his statement that it was not proposed tointroduce elaborate statutory controls over incomes and prices, and that the policy must continue to rely on voluntary-operation.      (Even if this were not the case, itv/ould hardly &quot;be practicable to set up effective machineryfor operating such controls within the twelve months period the new powers are to last).     Even though the temporarynew powers will be used very selectively, they need to bepotentially wide-ranging if they are effectively to deterthe selfish minority who are not prepared to co-operate andto reassure the majority who are prepared voluntarily to observe the policy laid down in the White Paper.12.     Provisional drafts of the new clauses are attached.27th July,  1966
