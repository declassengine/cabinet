US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 132 COPY NO.   g rj20th September, 1966CABINETUNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE ELIMINATION OFALL FORMS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 10th August the Home Affairs Committee considered the questionof the implications for the United Kingdom metropolitan territory of acceptance of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination.     The Committee agreed that, despitecertain difficulties, the balance of advantage lay in signing the Conventionwith a reservation on Rhodesia and statements of interpretation on articles 4, 6 (subject to further interdepartmental consultations on theform of words), 15 and 20.     The question of ratification would beconsidered at a later date.     The Committee invited the Minister of Statefor Foreign Affairs to arrange for the proposal that the United kingdom should sign the Convention, subject to the reservation on Rhodesia andthe statements of interpretation, to be submitted to the Cabinet.2.      I circulate to my colleagues the report by an inter-departmentalgroup of officials which was available to the Home Affairs Committee.The first part of the report (paragraphs 2 to 10) explains the generalnature of the Convention.    The second part (paragraphs 11 to 30)summarises the major points of difficulty for us.     The text of theConvention is at Annex A and more detailed observations are at AnnexB.3.       The Convention was adopted by the United Nations general assembly in December, 1965 and is now open for signature andratification.    25 states, including Canada, Denmark, Greece and theSoviet Union, have signed it and the United States have announced their intention of doing so.    Only one - Bulgaria - has ratified it,4,       Much of the Convention is badly drafted and obscure, partly because it represents a compromise between opposing points of view.Nevertheless adherence to the Convention is likely to be regardedinternationally as the touchstone in matters of racial discrimination.Strong pressure, both international and domestic, is likely to developon the United Kingdom to become a party to the Convention.-1-CONFIDENTSAL
5.       A number of difficulties arise.    The Convention contains no territorial application clause and acceptance by the United kingdom would bind our dependent territories.    V/e should therefore have to reserve our position about the application of the Convention to Rhodesia(paragraphs 12 to 14 of the Report).    Acceptance of the Convention wouldmake it very difficult to legislate to restrict the right of entry into theUnited Kingdom of the large number of coloured United Kingdom citizensin Commonwealth countries, particularly East Africa, though therewould be difficulties about this in any event (paragraph 23).    On thispoint the Home Affairs Committee recognised the difficulty in whichthe Government might be placed by Article 5 if there were a substantial increase in the influx of United Kingdom citizens of Asiatic origin, but thought the risk insufficient to justify refusal to sign.     There arealso difficulties about Article 4 which deals with freedom of speech and association (paragraphs 10 to 20), Article 6 dealing with the right of theperson discriminated against to seek satisfaction (paragraph 25),Article 15 dealing with petitions from, dependent territories (paragraphs26 to 29) and Article 20 which deals with reservations (paragraph 30),6.       It is proposed to mitigate these difficulties by an interpretativestatement on Articles 4, 6, 15 and 20 and a formal reservation on rhodesia.7.       While the Convention provides for reservations, Article 20stipulates that a reservation shall not be permitted if at least two-thirds of the parties to the Convention object to it.     There is a distinct risk that our reservation on Rhodesia might attract sufficient objections to fail under this procedure;  there might then be controversy as towhether, in that case, the United Kingdom was party to the Conventionwithout the protection of the reservation or whether the UnitedKingdom would not be regarded as a part?/ unless the reservation was withdrawn.     That we interpret the Convention in the latter sense wouldbe made clear by our interpretative statement on Article 20.8.       It is proposed that we should take signature and ratification intwo distinct steps.    About the time of signature we should give a clear indication to the General Assembly of our interpretation of the articles which cause difficulty and of our intended reservation on Rhodesia.The international reaction would be a factor in the decision whether ornot to ratify which would be taken at a later date.    It is possible thatreactions would be so adverse that it v/ould be inadvisable to proceedto ratification.9.       There have been two developments since the Home AffairsCommittee considered this matter.    First, as the Committee requested,further consideration has been given to the terms of the statement of interpretation on Article 6 and officials have agreed on the followingnew formulation:&quot;The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Irelandinterprets the requirement in Article 6 concerning &quot;repara.tionor satisfaction&quot; as being fulfilled if one or other of theseforms of redress is made available, and they interpret&quot;satisfaction&quot; as including redress effective to bring thediscriminatory conduct to an end&quot;.
This differs from the earlier statement (paragraph 25 of the official report) principally in that it makes no specific reference to the race relations Act 1965,,     This is felt to be an advantage particularly as theConvention v/ould apply to Northern Ireland and dependent territories to which the Race Relations Act has not been extended.10.       The dependent territories have been informed that the UnitedKingdom has it in mind to sign the Convention at the time of the general assembly subject to the agreed reservation and statements of interpretation, and their comments sought.  By 15th September 13 replieshad been received,,     These include most of the territories where,attitude to the Convention is especially significant such as Fiji, HongKong and Bahamas.    All 13 replies indicate willingness to accept theConvention subject to the proposed statements of interpretation beingmade and the resolution of further minor points which the commonwealth office do not see as presenting difficulty.    Fiji, as expected, has indicated that it will require reservations to be made at the time of ratification.    12 replies are outstanding but the Commonwealth office have sent urgent reminders about these and expect that they will be suffiently informed of the position by 22nd September for a decision tobe taken, possibly subject to confirmation in the case of any territorieswith replies still outstanding.    As the General Assembly opens on 20thSeptember I do not think we should delay our decision on this account,11.       I agree with the conclusion of the Home Affairs Committee thatthe balance of advantage lies in signing the Convention.    Signature doesnot commit us to more than a serious intention to seek to ratify.    Butit has a certain psychological impact.    If we can sign the Conventionduring the early part of the coming General Assembly (September/October), we are likely to be well placed internationally with no great pressure on us for very early ratification.    But if we have not signed,our position at the Assembly will be less easy.     There may also be advantage in signing at a time when it is clear to all mat, Rhodesiabeing in a state of rebellion, we are not in a position to enforce our views on Rhodesia and must make a reservation in that respect,12.       Accordingly, I invite my colleagues to agree that the UnitedKingdom should sign the Convention, subject to the reservation on rhodesia and the statements of interpretation on Articles 4, 6, 15 and20;  the precise timing of signature and the announcement of it wouldbe for decision in consultation with the Commonwealth Secretary andour Permanent Representative to the United Nations.G.B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1.19th September, 1966

If ministers decided that the metropolltcan territory could accept these requirements, the overseas territories, whose attitude wouldbe to some extent dependent on the United Kingdom&apos;s interpreta-tion of the instrument, would then be asked for a finaldecision on whether they individually could accept them.   Thepresent Report therefore covers the issues relevant to adecision in respect of the United Kingdom, alone.GENERAL DSSCRIPTION of the:, CONVENTION2.      The Convention on Racial Discrimination, the text ofwhich is contained in Annex A to this Report, was adoptedunanimously by the General Assembly on 21 December, 1965.    Itis open for signature and ratification.    Twenty two states have so far signed the Convention, but none has yet ratified.The United States have announced their intention of signing.The Convention    consists of three Parts.3.       Part I (Articles 1 to 7) sets out the substantiveobligations to be undertaken by states Parties.   Article l(l),the cornerstone of the Convention, defines &quot;racial discrimina-tioh&apos; as &quot;any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preferencebased on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic originwhich has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairingthe recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing,/of human
I ^        2361of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political,economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life&quot;.The sphere of operation of the Convention is thus restricted to the field of &quot;public life1&apos;.   While there can be no certaintylas to how this phrase will be interpreted it seems likely thatj questions relating to such matters as private industry and private accommodation are probably not covered.    The rest ofArticle I lays down further exceptions to the sphere of operation of the Convention.   Discrimination between citizensand non-citizens is not covered (paragraph 2);    nor are legalI provisions concerning nationality,  citizenship or naturalisationaffected, provided they do not discriminate against anyparticular nationality (paragraph 3).   Paragraph k, whichpermits special measures for the advancements of groups or individuals requiring special protection, has littlerelevance to the United Kingdom as such.k*       Article 2 contains the basic obligation for StatesParties, namely to condemn   racial discrimination and to pursue a policy of eliminating racial discrimination in all its forms and of promoting understanding among all races.   Tothis end each State Party assumes a series of specificobligations which include undertakings:-(a) to engage in no act or practice of racial discr-minationagainst persons, groups of persons or institutions and toensure.that all public authorities and public institutions,national and local, shall act in conformity with this obligation;(b) to review governmental, national and local policies andto remove laws and regulations which have the effect of creating or perpetuating racial discrimination;(c) to prohibit and. bring to an end, by all appropriatemoans, including legislation as required by circumstances,racial discrimination by any persons, group or organisation..   a-
5,     Article 3 requires states Parties to condemn racialsegregation and apartheid and to prevent, prohibit anderadicate all practices of this nature.6.      Article A which concerns action against racistpropaganda and organisations is the most controversialprovision in the instrument and the most difficult to interpret.By it Parties undertake the general obligation to condemnpropaganda and organisations based on racist ideas or whichattempt to justify racial hatred and discrimination and adoptimmediate and positive measures designed to eradicate allincitement to, or acts or, such racial discrimination.   Therefollow certain specific obligations including requirements to make illegal the dissemination of racist ideas as well asacts of violence or incitement to such acts against any raceor group   of persons and also the provision of any assistance,including financial assistance to racist activities.   Further,States Parties are to declare illegal and prohibit racistorganisations and propaganda activities, including participa-tion in such organisations and activities.   But in icarryingout these obligations States Parties are to have due regard to&quot;the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of human Sights and the rights expressly set forth in Article5 of the Convention&quot;.   This phrase was inserted in order tomeet the fears of 7\iestern countries regarding the implications of the Article for the freedoms of speech and association.7.      Article 5 requires States Parties to prohibit andeliminate racial discrmination and to guarantee the right toequality before the law in the enjoyment of a long catalogueQf rights.   By Article 6 States are to assure effective protection and remedies against certain acts of racial discrimination -nation as well as the right to seek reparation or ratificationfor damage suffered,.   Article 7 concerns general measures in^e field of education.&apos;   &apos; /a-.,
8. Part II  (Articles 8 - 16) provies for machinery to implement the Convention.    It lays down a procedure for the establishmentof a Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, a body of eighteen experts elected by States Parties from amongsttheir nationals and serving in their personal capacity( Article    8).   They will receive reports from States parties on the measures they have taken to give effect to theConvention and will moke an.annual report, including general recommendations and any comments by the States Parties, to theGeneral Assembly (Article 9).   They may receive inter-Statecomplaints relating to non-fulfilment of the Convention(Article 11) and appoint ad hoc Conciliation commissions to lend their good offices in the dispute (Article 12).    TheseCommissions will report to the Committee on questions of factrelating to the issue and make recommendations for itssolution.    On receipt of the Commission^ Report the StatesParties concerned have three months to indicate whether ornot they accept the recommendations after which time the report and the declarations of the parties to the dispute are circulatedto all the other States Parties.    (Article 13).   No further action is provided for, apart from the possibility of reference ofa dispute to the International Court under Article 22 (seeparagraph 10 below).9. &quot;Mention should also be ppde of Article 1b which provides for the optional acceptance by States Parties of the right ofpetition to the Committee by groups and individuals;    and ofArticle 15 which, establishes a procedure for considerationby the Committee of petitions received by other U.N. bodiesfrom inhabitants of dependent territories and related to thePrinciples and objectives of the Convention.   This latterprocedure is designed to operate whether or not the administeringpower has become a Party to the Convention./iO.
10.       Part III (Articles 17 to 25) comprises the finaldruses of the Convention.   The Convention enters into forcewhen 27 states have become Party to it (Article 19).   Article20 provides for reservations which are deemed to be acceptedunless two-thirds of the States Parties object to them.Disputes over the interpretation or application of theConvention may, at the request of one of the Parties, bereferred to the International Court (Article 22).
PRINCIPAL ISSUAS APTACTIWG THT; ABILITY OF tk6 METROPOLITANT32IT.QRY,T0. ACCEPT ..THL C OWvT; WTION11.     Each substantive article of&apos; the Convention and the moreimportant of the other articles are discussed in detail in annex B to this Report.    The present section contains a briefdescription of the main issues involved in acceptance of theConvention.P^ODBGIA12.     The Convention contains no territorial application clause.The effect of this is that conditions not only in the UnitedKingdom but also in the overseas territories under United Kingdomsovereignty must be substantially in line with the Conventionbefore we can accept it.   While the present Report is not concernedwith the question of the acceptability of this instrument in the overseas territories the problem of Rhodesia is central to themain decision on signature and ratification and the Working Group,therefore, decided to consider it at this stage.13.      It is unlikely that Rhodesia could accept many, if any, ofthe provisions.    Its future willingness and ability to accept the instrument will depend, to some extent on the constitutional settlement eventually reached, but it seems unlikely that Rhodesiawill be either able or willing to comply fully with the terms ofthe Convention for at least many years hence.    In any event?;whatever constitutional settlement may be reached, Britain is unlikely to have the power either to impose the acceptance of theConvention or the implementation of its obligations against thewishes of the constitutional Rhodesi an authorities,    a reservationexcluding Rhodesia from the application of the Convention would, belikely to encounter widespread objections and to fail underArticle 20 (2).    The only practical way round the difficultymight be a reservation excusing ourselves from applying the/Convention
Convention in Rhodesia because of our inability to ensure thatits terms are carried out there..   The following form of wordsis proposed:&quot;The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Irelandreserves the right not to apply this Convention to Rhodesiaunless and until it informs the Secretary-General of the united nations that it is in a position to ensure that the obligationsimposed by the Convention in restiect of that territory can be fully implemented&quot;.1UC   This reservation contains the basic difficulty that whenconstitutional authority is restored in Rhodesia we shall almost inevitably come under strong pressure to implement the provisionsof the Convention there immediately,    The form of words proposed would of course leave us free to determine at what point theConvention should be regarded as applying to Rhodesia and contains the implication that in the event we might never apply it to rhodesia at all, but for that very reason it may encountersufficient objections to fail under Article 20 (2).    On the otherhand the fact that we are not in a position to implement our international obligations in Rhodesia In present circumstances isY/ell-riaiown and the Afro-Asians may prefer to have us become partyto the Convention with the prospect that it will be applied to   !Rhodesia in the future rather than take action which might havethe effect of blocking our participation.entirely.ARTJCCI&amp;JI15.&apos; This Article defines the term &quot;racial discrimination&quot; andlays down a number of exceptions to the sphere of operation of theConvention.    The definition of racial discrimination includesdiscrimination on grounds of national origin.    There is some risk that this definition, and subsequent obligations in the Convention,may be held to strike at the present practice whereby the nationals of some countries, including Iron Curtain countries, are at/present
* &apos;   242-oresent treated less favourably than those of other countrieswhen consideration is being given whether to grant themoermission to come or remain here for work.    However, the risk ofdiscovery of this slight discrimination is small and, even if itwere discovered, there would be a reasonable chance of establishingthat the practice was not contrary to the Convention.    The working group therefore recommend, that the risk be accepted.16.   Article 2 sets out the basic obligations of States Partiesregarding the elimination of racial discrimination.   Paragraph 1(a) requires States Parties to ensure that all public authoritiesand public institutions, national and local, shall not engage indiscrimination.    Our existing practice does already comply with what is here enjoined.    In the unlikely event of a public authorityengaging in racial discrimination, if the Government were not ableunder existing legislation to put matters right (for example, theGovernment have powers to issue general directions to british railways) additional legislation might be necessary.17.   The obligation in paragraph 1  (d) to prohibit and bring toan end by all aprjropriate means, including legislation, as required&quot;by circumstances racial discrimination by any person, group organisation appears to be acceptable given the definition of racial discrimination in Article 1(1), but we might find ourselvesobliged, to legislate if our interpretation were not accepted andthere were no non-legislative means of putting the matter right.18.   This concerns action with respect to racist propaganda and organisations, Our existing legislation, including the RaceRelation Act, is probably adequate to enable us to accept thegeneral obligation to adopt immediate and positive measures designed, to eradicate all incitement to, or acts of, racial dis-crimination. But the Article goes on to impose more specific/obligations
CONFIDENTIALobligations which could create difficulties,,    These obligations   ^10v/hich require, inter alia, the prohibition of ;rall dissemination of ideas based on race superiority&quot;&apos; and of &quot;organisations and....... propaganda activities which promote and incite racial discrimination&quot; are qualified by the phrase &quot;with due regard tothe principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of human rights and the rights expressly set forth in Article 5 of thisConvention,&quot;   This phrase is the result of an amendment put forward to meet the difficulties of Western countries regarding freedom of speech and of associations.    It is however impossible to say forcertain how far this would be interpreted as modifying the specificobligations imposed by the Article.    If we ratify the Conventionwe shall, in the last resort, have to accept the interpretation ofthe Committee of States Parties which will be set up to implement the Convention, or, if we dispute their interpretation, thedecision of the International Court of Justice.1?.    In the view of the Working Group the best way to safeguard our position so far as this is possible is to mate a statement of interpretation on the following lines:    &quot;The United Kingdom ofGreat Britain and. Northern Ireland interprets Article h as requiring it to adopt further legislative measures in the fieldscovered, by sub-paragraphs (a)s (b) and (c) of that Article onlyinsofar as it may consider, with due regard to the principles,embodied   in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the rightsexpressly set forth in Article 5 of the Convention (in particular,the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the right tofreedom of peaceful assembly and association), that some legisla-tive addition to or variation of existing law and practice in thosefields is necessary for the attainment of the end&quot;specified inthe earlier part of Article A1&quot;,20.   There would, still be a risk that other States Parties wouldobject to this statement but on the other hand, it is similar tostatements made during the negotiation of the instrument and bythe United States recently when announcing that they would sign the Convention.   The Working Group recommend acceptance of theArticle subject to the proposed statement being made at some point.21.    By this Article States Parties undertake to prohibit andeliminate racial -discrimini^^^^^Q^Lj^ guarantee to everyone/e -^^^
equality before the law, in the enjoyment of a list of rights.One of these is &quot;the right to leave any country, including his own.and to return to his country&quot;.     This raises two difficultiesconnected with immigration.22.   Some critics might claim that the operation of the Common-wealth Immigrants Act discriminates on grounds of race or e\endescent or national origin.     The Act in fact distinguishes betweenholders of passports issued by the Government of the United Kingdomand holders of passports issued by the Governments of colonies.In the view of the Working Group this distinction is, in substance,based not on race, descent, or national origin but on connexion withsome United Kingdom territory other than the United Kingdom itself.If we had to defend this viev; in the International Court we shouldbe likely to win our case and the risk, of criticism should there-fore be accepted.23.   The second difficulty concerns the large number of colouredUnited Kingdom citizens in East Africa, Trinidad and Tobago. singapore and Malaysia who at present have the right of unrestricted entry into the United Kingdom and possess United Kingdom iss-ued passportsand have no connexion with any existing United Kingdom territoryother than the United Kingdom itself.     If in the future it became necessary to legislate to restrict their right of entry into the1 United Kingdom, this legislation would probably have to distinguish between Unitec1 Kingdom citizens on grounds inter alia of descentor national origin.     There is little doubt that such legislation would be regarded as a breach of our obligations under Article 5(d)(ii) and Article 2(1)(a).     But there is a strong argument thatsuch legislation would in any event be contrary to existing inter-national law, at least if it required the refusal of entry to thiscountry to a United Kingdom citizen whom a foreign government wouldnot allow to remain In Its territory,     The Working Group wish to observe that ratification of the Convention would increase the/difficulties
CONFIDENTIAL o A v245difficulties of legislating to control the entry of United kingdom citizens in this category.ARTICLES &amp;2k*   By this Article States Parties are required to provideremedies against certain acts of racial discrimination and the righto seek reparation or ratification for damage suffered,   Tv/odifficulties arise.   There may &quot;be cases where an act of racial discrimination could on a wider Interpretation be said to violatethe Convention and where there is. in our case, no remedy through a national tribunal or other State institution.    One example mightbe discrimination in a shop, which is not covered, by the race relations Act,    The extent of the difficulty largely depends on future interpretation.    But there are probably few types of caseswhere we would be likely to be in difficulty and the Working Grouprecommend, that such risk as there is be accepted.25.   A second, difficulty is that while we would argue thatreparation and satisfaction are to be construed, as alternatives(i,e, states parties are not obliged, to make provision for materialreparation in all cases of damage suffered)  there is some danger that the organs which will have the task of interpreting theConvention will rule otherwise.    In this case we should be indifficulty because our law contains no provision for materialreparation in all such cases.   We should also want the term&quot;satisfaction&apos;&apos; to be regarded as covering the types of redressprovided, by the Race Relations Act, 1965.   The Working Grouptherefore recommend that acceptance of this Article be formally(i.&apos;e, on signature)  qualified by the following statement of interpretation:    &quot;The United Kingdom of Great Britain end NorthernIreland interprets the requirement in Article 6 concerning&quot;reparation or satisfaction&quot; as being fulfilled, in its case, sofar as the matters covered, by the Race Relations Act, 1965 are/concerned
oncerned, by the assurance of the right to seek the redressrovided for in that Act, in addition to any other form ofedress which may be amiable under existing law.&quot;   V.&apos;e wouldere be assuming that any act of racial discrimination which mayrise and is not covered by the Race Relations Act is eitherButside the scope of the Article or is a wrongful act by someOther provision of our law (and. that, therefore, the wrongedlerson will have the right to seek satisfaction.)   There isIsome risk that acts of racial discrimination within the meaningf the Article may occur where our law provides no right toleek satisfaction but it is felt that this risk can be accepted,trticle 15p.   This Article establishes a procedure by which the Committeeim the &quot;Dlimination of Racial Discrimination (the standingimplementation body) may receive from other United Nationsbodies (probably the Committee of 2A) copies of petitionsreaching them from inhabitants of colonial territories and.relating to the principles of the Convention and recommendationsof the relevant body on these petitions.   The Committee will also receive copies of reports by other United. Nations bodiesconcerning measures taken by the administering powers andrelating to the principles of the Convention.   The Committee isto include in its report to the General Assembly a summary ofthis material and its opinions and. recommendations on it.   TheCommittee may also make recommendations to other United Nationstodies concerned with colonial questions.27.   Yie opposed, this Article in the General Assembly but onlyPortugal voted against it with us.    Our objections were twofold,first that it was discriminatory in that it established, a procedurfor the receipt of petitions relating to colonial territorieswhile making no comparable provision for States without such territories (which have an option under Article 1h to accept thecompetence of the Committee to consider communications from within/their
Kjjeir jurisdiction).   Secondly it purported to establish afprocedure applicable to the dependent territories of StatesIl&apos;h;ther or not those States had. become parties.. ?s.   ,;ihile these objections of principle remain, the practical&quot;effects of accepting the Article, as opposed to not accepting it,Mo not seem to be very significant.    If we do not ratify thei Convention the procedure   established by Article 15 will, never the-loss operate,   The Committee will receive material relating to?the colonial territories and will make recommendations about itIto United Nations bodies.   We would then be faced with the choicel;bf declining to co-operate with the bodies concerned on thebounds that the procedure was improper or of commenting substan-lively on the recommendations.   The former alternative would bepossible but there was little support, even&quot;from our friends, forthis view during the Assembly debates and we should be likely tome isolated.    If we were to comment substantively on theIro commendations we might as well have accepted the procedure infthe first place.    Ratification of the Convention would probablypot add substantially to our present difficulties in defendingjour colonial policy in the United Nations.   With the notable[exception of Rhodesia, and, possibly, Fiji, we are probably notvery vulnerable as regards racial discrimination in the overseas territories .29.. The Colonial Office had pointed out that whatever attitude3.M. Government may take the governments of some of the dependent territories may take strong objection to Article 15.    But the firststop must be to reach a decision on our own attitude.    On this the Departments concerned, agreed, to recommend acceptance of theArticle qualified by an interpretative statement which v/ouldreiterate our objections in principle, make it clear that we areprepared to accept the Article only because of the importance we attach to the Convention as a whole&apos;, and reserve our position asto the inclusion of a similar article in any future Convention./Article 20
t-iole 20 .. 248This Article concerns reservation and is of particulargportance as regards Rhodesia (see paragraph 12 above).   Ajservatiori is not accepted if it Is objected to by two-thirdsf the States Parties to the Convention;    but it is not clear the their this means that the reserving state is not regarded as aty to the Convention or whether it is bound by the convention is if the reservation had not been made.    V&apos;e should wish, to establishformer interpretation and it is recommended that aninterpretative statement should be made for this purpose,fccommendati oh31.   The arguments for signature and ratification from an inter-national point of view are strong.    The elimination of racialdisrimination had become one of the major preoccupations of theUnited Nations and with the continuing situations in rhodesia and South Africa will remain so for the foreseeable future.   Onthese two issues we are. for reasons unconnected with our attitude to race relations, forced to appear negative.    Ratification ofthe Convention would demonstrate that, however much other considerations may inhibit us from going along with the viewsof the majority of the United Nations members on these matters,mo are sincere in our frequently stated determination to eliminateracial discrimination at home and abroad.    If we do not ratifythere can be little doubt that the progressive posture we havestriven to adopt on human rights matters in the United Nations&quot;ill be tarnished and. criticism, both international and domesticsill be strong.32.   At the same time the difficulties presented by the Convention?re large and the complicated pattern of reservations andstatements of interpretation which would be necessary may be a source of embarrassment, particularly if the Afro-Asian and.Coraimnist countries formally object to them.   The Conventionf&apos;hich is in many places badly drafted, and. unclear in meaning will/be
be subject to implementation and interpretation by the expert committee on the Elimination of Uncial Discrimination which mayor may not turn out to be a responsible body.   There can be no guarantee that it will accept the United Kingdom point of view in cases of disputed interpretation, though we should probablybo able to appeal to the International Court in the last resorton such matters.    If the Court found against us, we should however be under an obligation to change our law so far assight be necessary to give effect to its decision.33.    One way of mitigating some of the difficulties would, beto try out the proposed statements of interpretation andreservation on international opinion before committing ourselves to formal ratification.    It would be possible to make the statements of interpretation on Articles h, 6, 15 and. 2 0 during debate inthe General Assembly.   Then, on signature wo could state our intention to make the potentially controversial reservation on rhodesia.    In the light of any reactions, Ministers could, then consider whether to proceed to ratification.    Signature alone would not commit us to anything except a serious intentionto seek to ratify.3k.   On balance, and particularly bearing in mind the adverseinternational and domestic reaction that would be likelyif we were not to sign or ratify the Convention, the working group recommends that the United. Kingdom should sign theConvention, following a procedure similar to that described in paragraph 33 above, and that the question of ratificationshould be further considered in the light of any reactions.Ministers might wish to await the result of the finalconsultations with overseas territories before authorisingsignature.   But since signature alone involves no obligationbeyond that described in paragraph 32 above it would bepossible to sign before the final consultations envisaged withthe overseas territories take place.

ANNEX 3Detailed Observation on the ConventionpTICLEi.I.     This Article defines racial discrimination and states certain exceptions to the sphere of operation of the Convention.     Thewhole of the Convention is to be construed with regard to the definition of racial discrimination in paragraph 1 which makes itclear that the Convention is concerned only with the field of&quot;public life&quot;.     The difficulty is to estimate how this phrasetrill be interpreted by organs whose task it will be to interpret the Convention,,     The Working Group took the view throughout its.discussions that whereas actions by the central and local govern-mental authorities, as well as other bodies such as the boards of nationalised industries, and public services such as hotels,restaurants and transport are certainly covered, the field ofprivate industry and such matters as private accommodation are probably not.     In between there were some borderline cases, e.g.shops, where it was difficult to be at all certain which way futureinterpretation v/ould point,2,     The definition of racial discrimination in paragraph 1includes discrimination on grounds of national origin.     Althoughit is clear from paragraph 2 that discrimination by a Statebetween its citizens and non-citizens is not covered by theConvention, it might appear on the face of the Article thatdiscrimination between non-citizens is covered.     The nationals of Iron Curtain countries are at present treated less favourablythan those of other countries when consideration is being givenwhether to grant them permission to come or remain here for work(and this, in turn, makes it less likely that they will be able toobtain United Kingdom nationality by naturalisation).     Our actionin this respect might accordingly be construed as discriminationon grounds of national origin.     However, the records of debate on the Convention show that the reference to national origin was directed at the case of multi-national States.     There was no suggestion that the Article extended to cases of discrimination between foreigners on grounds of national origin,,     Moreover, when considering a similar reference to the IoLo0o Convention onDiscrimination in Employment and Occupation, the I.L.O. Committeeconcerned agreed that the reference In that Convention todistinctions made on the &quot;basis of national extraction meantdistinctions between nationals of the ratifying country.     Therisk of discovery of the slight discrimination practiced againstIron Curtain nationals is very small, and, even if it werediscovered, there would be reasonable chance of establishingthat the practice was not contrary to the Convention.     It wouldbe possible to make a statement of interpretation covering thepoint but this   would only spotlight the difficulty and court thedanger of rejection by the organs which will be charged withsupervising the implementation of the Convention,     Moreover, itBill probably be necessary to make interpretative statements on more important articles of the Convention and it is desirable tokeep such statements to a minimum.3.     The Working Group therefore recommend that the risk beaccepted.k*     No other aspects of the Article appear to give rise todifficulty./ ARTICLE 2
ARTICLE 25.     This article constitutes the &quot;basic obligation for Statesparties with regard to the elimination of racial discrimination in all its forms.     By it each Party undertakes not to practiceracial discrimination itself and to ensure that all public authorities and public institutions act similarly.     It furtherundertakes not to support racial discrimination by persons ororganisations, to review its policies and amend its laws and regulations where they contain any element of racial discrimination,to prohibit and bring to an end racial discrimination by any persons, group or organisations and to promote good inter-racialrelations.     Paragraph 2 which allows special measures to securethe adequate development and protection of certain racial groups or individuals has little relevance to the metropolitan   territory.6.     A number of minor problems arise on Article 2(1) (a).     In themain our existing practice complies with the requirement that weshould ensure that all public authorities and public institutions,national and local, shall act in conformity with the obligation to engage in no act or practice of racial discrimination.     In theunlikely event of a public authority engaging in racial discriminar-tion, to the extent that the government could not put mattersright, legislation might conceivably be necessary.7.     Since the definition in Article 1 also includes discriminationon grounds of descent a possible difficulty in connection with article 2(1 )(a) (and perhaps also with Article 5(e)(1)) arises from the fact that under the Regulations on admission to the CivilService eligibility for certain appointments, is, on security grounds, made dependent not only on possession of british nationality by the applicant but also, in the first instance, onpossession of such nationality by one or both of his parents.It is considered, however, that we could rely on establishingthat these conditions (which are likely to be reflected in thecorresponding regulations of many other countries) have noelement of racial discrimination in any normal sense and are reasonably related to the security, representational and other requirements of the appointments concerned;   and that, consequently,they do not constitute discrimination on grounds of descent in aracial sense as that word Is to be interpreted in Article 1 and involve no Impairment of human rights and fundamental freedomswithin the meaning of that Article or contrary tc Article 5,The Working Group therefore recommends that, here also, such riskas there is should be accepted.&apos; 8.     Another possible difficulty arises with Article 2(1)(a) inrespect of our policy on immigration but this problem arises moresubstantially with Article 5 and is discussed there.9.     Article 2(1)(b),  (c) and (e) create no difficulty.10.     As regards Article 2(1 )(d.) the Working Group consider that,given the overall limitation of discrimination, as defined inArticle 1(1) of the Convention, to the field of public life,private activities such as the conduct of private clubs and questions of private accommodation or employment in private business concerns should not be regarded as affected.     This is however a matter of interpretation of the Convention and thereis of course a risk that our interpretation may not be acceptedby the organs established by the Convention or by the international court in the event of the reference of a dispute to it./ ARTICLE 3
ARTICLE 312.      In this provision States Parties particularly condemn racialsegregation and apartheid and undertake to prevent, prohibit anderadicate, in territories under their jurisdiction, all practicesof this natureo     Such practices do not exist in the metropolitcanterritory and the Article causes no difficulty there.ARTICLE h13.     The Article is concerned with action against racistpropaganda and organisations.     States Parties have the generalobligation to condemn all propaganda and organisations &quot;which are based on ideas or theories of superiority of one race or group ofpersons of one colour or ethnic origin, or which attempt to justifyor promote racial hatred and discrimination in any form &quot;and toadopt immediate and positive measures designed to eradicate allincitement to, or acts of, such discrimination.     To this generalend they undertake certain specific obligations - (a) to declareas an offence punishable by law the discrimination of ideas basedon racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination:violence or incitement to violence against a race or group and theprovision of assistance to racist activities,  (b) to declareillegal and prohibit racist organisations and propaganda activities and recognise participation in such organisations and activitiesas a punishable offence, and (c) not to permit public authorities or public institutions to promote or incite racial discrimination.It is, however, specified that these obligations are to be carriedout &quot;with due regard to the principles embodied in the UniversalDeclaration of Human Rights and the rights expressly set forth inArticle 5 of this Convention.&quot;1h,     The Working Group considered this to be one of the most difficult articles in the Convention.     Clearly sections 6 and 7of the Race Relations Act 1965 go at the very least a long way towards meeting its requirements.     Nevertheless, the specificobligations in paragraphs (a) and (b) present problems.Paragraph (a) would seem to trespass too far into the acceptedsphere of public or private discussion.     Paragraph (b) would also not be acceptable tout court .     Opinion in this country is opposed;even in war, to declar tion illegal and thepreference has always been to make certain activities illegal.The principal question is how far the saving clause quoted at theend of paragraph 13 above can be regarded as qualifying the specific obligations to an extent which would enable one to rely on our existing law, including the Race relations Act, as suffi-cient to comply with the Article.     On this there can be no certainty and in the last analysis it will be for the organs whosetask it is to interpret the Convention to decide the point.     Butthere are some encouraging factors.     Pirst, the clause wasspecifically Inserted to meet the fears of Western countriesregarding freedom of speech and association (these freedoms arespelt out both in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 5 of the Convention).     Secondly, a number of delegationsmade explanations of vote in the General Assembly to the effectthat their governments would interpret the Article as meaning thatthey were not required to take measures inconsistent with thefreedom of speech and association.     The United Kingdom delegationsaid &quot;it believed that the use in the introductory paragraph ofthe wording originally proposed by the five Nordic countries ...sufficiently safeguarded freedom of speeah and freedom of association, and it was in that spirit that the United kingdom would interpret the article as a whole&quot; (A/C.3/SR J 31 8) .     Lastly,/ the
the United States Government in announcing recently that theywould sign the Convention stated that their constitutional provision!for the protection of individual rights, such as the right of free speech, would he governing insofar as implementation of theConvention in the United States is concerned.15.     The Working Group considered three alternative courses of act ion:-(a)    to say nothing and trust that future interpretationwill protect our positionj(d)    to make a formal statement of interioretation ons i gnature and/or rat if i cat i on;(c)   to make a similar statement not on signature orratification hut during debate in the General Assembly.It was considered that (a) was too risky and that it would benecessary to have some further statement to point to in order tosafeguard our position later so far as this is possible.   &apos; they therefore favoured the statement of interpretation, the text ofwhich is contained In paragraph 19 in the main body of the Report,,This statement would not be without its dangers.     Although wewould not regard it as a formal reservation of the sort providedfor in Article P.0 and would not, therefore, consider it to beopen to the objections procedure, there is no guarantee that other parties would take the same view.     They might (although inthe light of the drafting history and the eventual wording thiswould not be easy to maintain) dispute that the Article could properly be interpreted in this sense.     A dispute on this initialpoint could in the last resort be taken to the International Courtof Justice.     The risks involved in making the statement were not so great as to contribute an obstacle to ratification and theWorking Group therefore recommend that the Article be acceptedsubject to the statement being made.     The timing of the statement was a matter for the Foreign Office.16.     Northern Ireland is in a rather different position from great Britain in that it has no legislation comparable to the race Relations Act.     This would make their position under theproposed statement more vulnerable.     But their defence would bethat they have no problem of racial discrimination and that, while this remains the case, no further legislative measures in the fields covered by the Article are necessary there..      If such a&quot;problem developed, Northern Ireland might have to adopt legislation to supplement existing common la?/ prohibitions on such matters asincitement to violence,     So long as no problem exists it is unlikely that there would be criticism of Northern Ireland on thegrounds that it has no legislation comparable to the Race relations act.17.   Article 14(c) creates no difficulties.\\ARTICLE^18.   This Article also raises problems of interpretation.     By itStates Parties appear to incur two main obligations viz. (a) to prohibit and eliminate racial discrimination, and (b) to guarantee the right of everyone to equality before the law, both withrespect to the enjoyment of the catalogue of rights tabulated inthe remainder of the Article.     It could not have been the objectof the Article to confer the full enjoyment of the rights set outin paragraphs (a) to (f).     This would have been out of place in a/ Convention
Convention designed to eliminate racial discrimination andwould have duplicated, at least in part, the purpose of thedraft Covenents on Human Rights.      It would therefore be necessaryfor a State Party to be able to show, with respect to eachright listed, that insofar as it was guaranteed in its law and practice, there was no element of racial discrimination and noinequality based on race, colour, or national or ethnic originsbefore the law.19.     One of the rights listed, in paragraph (d)(ii), is &quot;theright to leave any country, including his own, and to return tohis country.&quot;     Here, two possible difficulties arise, bothconnected with the question of immigration.20.     Pirst, some critics might claim that the operation of theCommonwealth Immigrant   Act, distinguishing as it does between different categories of citizens of    the United Kingdom and colonies, in fact discriminates on grounds of race or even descentor national origin.     The distinction is in fact made betweenholders of passports issued by the Government of the UnitedKingdom and holders of passports issued by the Governments of dependent territories.     This is certainly not discrimination on grounds of race.     Nor is it really discrimination relating todescent or nacional origin, if those terms are, as seemsappropriate, construed e,jusdem p;eneris with the r est of the listin Article 1(1).     It is a distinction based in substance onconnection with some United Kingdom territory other than theUnited Kingdom itself.     The Working Group took the view that though the position may not be readily understood, it is in factdefensible.     If we ever had to defend it in the international court of Justice we ought to win our case.     A statement of interpretation would invite criticism and suggest a weakness inour position.21.     The second difficulty concerns the large number (perhapsup to 2 million) of United Kingdom citizens in East Africa,Trinidad and Tobago, Singapore and Malaysia who at present havethe right of unrestricted entry into the United Kingdom and possessUnited Kingdom-issued passports even though they owe their UnitedKingdom citizenship to connection with former dependenciesrather than with the United Kingdom itself.     In their case thereis, however, no connection with any existing United Kingdomterritory other than the United Kingdom itself.     On instructions from Ministers the Commonwealth,Immigration (Official) Committeehave been considering possible statutory ways of controlling their.entry if there were any significant change in the present rateof immigration.     It appears that, if legislation becamedesirable,.it would be likely to distinguish between United kingdom citizens   on grounds inter alia of descent and/or national originwhich in this case could not be defended as in substance repre-senting connexion with some other United Kingdom territory andwhich would because of the identity of the persons against whom it would obviously be directed have the strong appearance of being based on racial grounds,,22.     There is a strong argument that such legislation would inany event be contrary to existing international law, at leastif it required the refusal of entry, to this country to a UnitedKingdom citizen whom a foreign government would not allow toremain in its territory.     There is little doubt that if theUnited Kingdom ratified the present Convention legislation of the type envisaged would be regarded as involving a breach of our obligations under Article 5, and also under Article 2 (1) (a).&apos; / The Working
The Working Group, therefore ,wish to observe that ratificationwould not only increase already existing difficulties in the wayof introducing legislation &quot;but probably make it impossible tocontrol the admission into the United Kingdom of this categorycf United Kingdom sitizens.ARTICLE 623.     This Article has two limbs;.     First, States Parties arerequired to assure to everyone within their jurisdiction effective protection and remedies through the competent   national tribunals and other State institutions against any acts of racial discrimina-tion which violate a person&apos;s human rights and fundamental freedomscontrary to the Convention.     Secondly, they are required to assure to everyone the right to seek from such tribunals just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for any damage suffered asa result of such discrimination,,2h0     One question of interpretation arises on the second limbof the Article.      Does it require that both reparation (i.e. some form of material compensation) and satisfaction shall be available or are these to be regarded as alternatives?     We would argue(this is partly borne out by the records of debate), that they are properly to be regarded as alternatives between which a StateParty is entitled to choose;    that is, it must make one or theother available in every case, but Is not bound to give victimsthe opportunity of seeking material reparation in all cases.     thus the possibility of seeking satisfaction through the machineryestablished by the Race Relations Act or through the courts would suffice, at least in the fields covered by that Act or otherexisting legal provisions, even though those methods (and particu-larly that of the Act) may Involve no material reparation for the victim.     There is, however, some danger that the organs ?/hich willhave the task of interpreting the Convention would rule that theremust in all cases be provision for material reparation.     TheWorking Group therefore recommends that United Kingdom acceptanceof this Article be formally qualified by the statement proposed inparagraph 25 of the main part of this Report.25.     A second difficulty arises on the first limb of the article which concerns the provision of remedies.      There may be cases where an act of racial discrimination could on a wide interpretation besaid to violate the Convention and where there is under our law noremedy through a national tribunal or other State institution, e.g.5discrimination in a shop or hairdresser!s, which is not covered by-the Race Relations Act.     The extent of the difficulty againlargely depends on future interpretation.     There are severalarguments which are available to us - for example, that a shop isnot covered by Article 5(f) ana that discrimination in a shop isnot to be regarded as discrimination in the field of public -lifewithin the meaning of Article 1(1);    that discrimination in a shopdoes not impair any generally recognised human rights and funda-mental freedoms;    and that the phrase &quot;human rights and fundamentalfreedoms contrary to this Convention&quot; has in any event to beconsidered with Article 5 and thus to be given a restrictive meaningso that a remedy, has to be available only where an act of racial discrimination violates human rights and fundamental freedoms in themanner forbidden by Article 5 - that is, by producing inequalityin the enjoyment of one of the rights described in that article which is conferred by law.26.     There is some possibility of occurrence of acts of discrimina-tion which could be held to be covered by this Article and forwhich existing remedies would not be adequate.     The risk depends on the likelihood of a breach of other provisions of the Con-vention occurring.     It is unlikely that the United Kingdom/ would
would often be in breach.     In some cases there would bea remedy;    in other cases the State could probably take some action.     The Working Group therefore recommends that suchrisk as there is on this point be accepted.ARTICLE 727.     This constitutes a general obligation to adopt immediate and effective measures, mainly in the educational field, to combatracial prejudice and to promote inter-racial understanding.It raises no difficulties.IMPLEMENTATION ARTICLES (PART II of the ConventionGEKigRAL2S.     Articles 8 to 1k and Article 16 of the Convention, whichestablish the implementation machinery described in detail inparagraphs 8 and 9 of the main body of the Report are generally acceptable.     We have always supported moves to insert provisions for effective implementation machinery in international instruments and we strongly supported these particular provisions during debateAttention is drawn to Article 1k which provides for the optionalacceptance by a State Party of the competence of the Committee onthe Elimination of Racial Discrimination to receive and considercommunications from individuals or groups claiming to be victims of a violation by that State Party of any of the rights in theConvention.     A- State Party may declare its acceptance of theCommittee&apos;s competence in this respect at any time.     The working group consider that this provision raises Issues separate fromthat raised by the general question of acceptance of the convention and recommend that it be considered separately at a later date.ARTICLE 15&apos;29.     This is the only article on the matter of implementationwhich we opposed in the General Assembly.     Its effect is toestablish a procedure by which the Committee on the elimination of Racial Discrimination will receive from other United Nationsbodies and consider copies of petitions received from the inhabi-tants of colonial territories and relating to the principles and objectives of the Convention.     A detailed description .of theprocedure, of our objections in.principle to the provision andof its likely practical effects has been given in the main body of-the Report and nothing further need be added here.FINAL ARTICLES (PART IIiV30.     These articles are generally acceptable,,     Only two Articlescall for comment.ARTICLE 2031 .     This Article permits States to make reservations whensatisfying or acceding to the Convention, provided, that the reservations are   not incompatible with the object and purposeof the Convention and do not inhibit the operation of any of the bodies established by the Convention.     Other States then havea period of ninety days in which to object to a reservation./ A reservation
A reservation is deemed incompatible or inhibitive if two thirds of the Parties object to it, but the Article does not say whetherthe effect of this provision is that the reserving State is Iregarded as not being a Party to the Convention or whether it isregarded as bound by the Convention as if the reservation had notbeen made.     We should wish to make it clear that we interpret the Article in the former sense.     Unfortunately we have taken the other view in objecting to reservations made by other states to other Conventions.ARTTCUD 22.32.     This provides that any dispute between two or more Partiesconcerning the interpretation or application of the Conventionmay., if not resolved &quot;by other means, he referred by any of themto the International Court.      It Is important to note that theparties concerned would be bound by the judgment of the court and obliged to take such measures, by legislation or otherwise,iiecessary to give effect to it,RHODESIA33.   The question of the application of the Convention toFdiodesia has been dealt with in the body of the Reportparagraphs &apos;1 2 to 1 h),,
