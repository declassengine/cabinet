OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 121 COPY NO.26th July, 1966CABINET67IN ZAMBIAN COPPER SUPPLIESNote by the President of the Board of TradeAlthough the Zambian Government has agreed to allow copper to be delivered free on rail Livingstone, the threat to our copper supplies isby no means ended.    The tonnages to be allowed out in this v/ay will belimited to those amounts which cannot be shipped over the alternativeroutes.    The amount to be allowed out through Rhodesia will be determinedmonthly and the Zambian Government could close this route again.    the zambian Government could also refuse import licences for Wankie coal,on which copper production depends.    Although there are adequate stocksof Wankie coal at present in Zambia to maintain full copper production fora short time, if Wankie coal were stopped copper production would be curtailed.2.       K we reach agreement with Zambia on a phased intensification of sanctions in exchange for continuing aid, we should avoid any unilateral action by the Zambian Government,    If, however, no agreement is reached on a phased cut-off, either because we make no further offer to Zambia or because Zambia does not accept any offer we make, the movement ofZambia&apos;s copper rests in Zambia&apos;s hands.    A curtailment of Zambia!scopper exports before alternative routes had been improved would affectthe price we pay for copper and would reduce our physical supplies of copper.3.      If Zambia exports to her normal production capacity of some60, 000 tons a month, and assuming that there is no interruption to worldcopper supplies elsewhere (for example, that there is no further Chileanstrike), we expect copper prices to settle around  500 a ton in the coming months, although, given the current fall in world consumption, thistheoretical price may fall towards the end of this year.    Because thereis now virtually a world price for copper (outside North America), any loss of copper from Zambia will impinge upon the world price and affectthe cost of all our copper important*ts.4.      It is difficult to predict the level to which the world price would rise with a curtailment of Zambian copper, but over the past two months,during which time Zambian copper exports have not moved throughRhodesia and exports have been limited to the capacity of the alternativeroutes (some 20, 000 tons a month), the three months1 forward price forcopper wirebars has been about  600 a ton.    This price was expected to-1-
tise in the autumn if the interniption. ta Zambia.^ eyporta continued.The following table assumes the level to which world prices would rise,given various monthly levels of exports from Zambia, and estimates theincreased cost of our imports of copper from all sources and the totaladditional burden to United Kingdom balance of payments resulting from increased imports of substitutes and lost exports;Monthly level Increased Total additionalof copper costs of burden to Unitedexports from       Assumed world        imports of Kingdom balanceZambia _price_ copper of paymentsTens  per ton  m. monthly  m. monthly38,000 570 1.9 3.430,000 600 2.4 5.620,000 640 2.9 7.nil 720 3.4 9.45.      Apart from the cost to our balance of payments of an interruptionin Zambian copper exports, we have to consider the effect on theUnited Kingdom economy of a physical loss of copper supplies.    As longas we can ensure that our copper fabricators have access to alternativesupplies, we expect them to be able to make good part of the loss ofZambian copper.    Nevertheless, our electrical engineering industry is dependent upon Zambia for half its supplies of copper and is* therefore,most vulnerable to any curtailment in these supplies.    Our transport industry is also vulnerable because of its limited scope for economies inthe use of copper.    There would also be a number of smaller sectorswhere production difficulties and delays would occur because of ashortage of essential copper components.    Although substitution isalready going ahead in the electric cable industry, efforts to maintainefficiency with different grades of copper or alternative materials couldmean re-designing, re-tooling and production delays.    The higher thelevel of Zambian copper exports the less risk there is of seriousdisruption to overall United Kingdom industrial production;  but ifZambian exports stopped entirely it would hot be possible, especially inthe short term, to avoid serious difficulties, including severe damage toour export trade.    If the alternative routes for Zambian copper can be improved so that, even after a cut-off, some 38, 000 tons a month couldbe exported, there should not be a serious disruption in our own economy.13.
