IMPORT CONTROLSNote by OfficialsThis note is addressed to the question whether import controlsshould enter into the statement now expected on Wednesday.   It comes to the following conclusion.2.     If any reference at all were made to the possible introductionof quantitative restrictions, or to consultations with this in mind,it would provoke an immediate and substantial increase in all theimports likely to be affected.   There is evidence that forestallingof this kind is already taking place.   Moreover there is a strongdanger that, if q,r. were presented as part of the package, foreignopinion would conclude that the rest of the package was not likely tobe effective by itself.    If the package were sufficient q.r. v/ouldnot be needed.3.     It recommends that the idea of introducing quantitative restric-tions or of rretaining the import charge should not be pursued.    if ministers accept this recommendation it would be important to reassure the public that no such control is contemplated.   So longas there is uncertainty there will be forestalling,k-     The only control that could safely be announced is the possibleintroduction of import deposits, but this v/ould only produce a limitedshort term advantage.5.     There are three possibilities: quantitative restrictions, importdeposits and the continuation of the temporary import charge.A system of quantitatlve,restyictlons6*     Fresh legislation would not be needed.   A possible scheme could produce a net cut of about  200m. in a full year (as compared with 100m, for the present surcharge) but in the first six months the saving in practice v/ould be at considerably less than half the planned/annual
I annual rate.   The scheme vrould cover manufactured consumer goods,I certain other manufactures (including &quot;off-the-peg&quot; machinery), aj range of manufactured foodstuffs and certain semi-manufacturesreadily available domestically.   Most imports of machinery are not susceptible of restraint by a system of quotas because each individual import is specially procured, frequently by its eventualuser, and there is no question of a regular demand for similar items;if machinery imports were to be restrained this would have to be doneby individual licensing.   Before the scheme of quota restrictionscould operate 8 weeks would be needed for the necessary decisions(e.g. on coverage) to be taken, and for the 350 staff required tobe recruited and housed.   The staff required would be mainly in theexecutive and clerical grades where serious shortages already existfollowing the build-up of work e.g. on investment grants and the selective employment tax.   If individual licensing were to be imposed on imports of machinery there would be an additional staffrequirement of the same order of magnitude; the difficulties of recruitment would be even greater since the scheme would require aconsiderable number of trained technicians to assess comparativeneeds.These are not available in Government Departments and wouldhave to be drawn from productive industry.7.     The Board of Trade advise strongly that it would be undesirable to announce the scheme before preparations were complete.   It wouldbe impossible to police until the administrative apparatus was setup, and effective arrangements could not be made for retrospectionof the quotas to the date of the announcement.   The effect would be widespread forestalling on a considerable scale.
Import Deposits8.     This would require legislation which would he extremelycontroversial.     In particular it would not he possible to avoidnumerous amendments relating to the coverage of the scheme.     although a draft Bill already exists its passage through Parliament could not he very rapid.9.     The effect on imports of a scheme of import deposits is difficultto estimate in view of the lack of any past experience.   A scheme withthe same coverage as the temporary import charge, with deposits of100 per cent for three months would freeze  hOOm. of credit.     Theeconomic advisers concluded that as a continuing method of importrestraint an import deposit scheme would not &quot;be effective; hut that itmight he useful as a means of dampening the surge which would follow the removal of the import charge..   The case for such a scheme willhave been weakened by the severity of existing monetary restraints anaby their prospective intensification as a result of the incidence ofthe selective employment tax payments.10.    It is not expected that the announcement of a scheme of importdeposits before the expiry of the temporary import charge would giverise to significant forestalling.   A period of some months would,however, be required to recruit and train the 130 staff needed to operate - a scheme with the same coverage as the temporary importcharge, and to programme the computer and obtain additional equipment.It may be doubted whether the short-term savings to be obtained wouldoutweigh the considerable legislative and administrative difficulties.Continuance of the temporary import charge11. Fresh legislation would be required to prolong the temporaryimport charge beyond the end of November 1966. The Bill would bestraightforward but it would nonetheless be controversial and would be/susceptiable-3-
ij :    125J susceptible of a great deal of detailed amendment.   No newjadministrative machine would have to be created and no problem of forestalling would arise; but there are formidable international difficulties.International aspects12.   The temporary import charge has been under continuous inter-national fire, particularly in E.F.T.A., for a period of nearly two years.    It has been tolerated only in the face of repeatedassurances that it was a temporary measure introduced to hold thesituation until longer term policies became effective.   We haveargued all along that, although it contravened the letter of inter-national agreements, they did permit the use of direct restraintson imports as a temporary measure by a country in balance ofpayments difficulties and the charge was less rigid and less per-manent than any system of q.r.    In the past two months since theremoval of the charge was announced, firm assurances have beengiven both to the House of Commons and to E.F.T.A. that&quot;WhiXe-Her Majesty&apos;s Government cannot be ^expected to givea hard and fast undertaking of indefinite duration, notto take alternative direct measures, if e.g. the balanceof payments once again deteriorated seriously, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not intend to replace the surcharge by anyother measure of direct import restraint on the demise ofthe charge.&quot;13.   The continuation of the import charge or its immediate replace-ment by quantitative restrictions would be regarded as a direct       ..breach of faith.-  It would provoke massive international criticismin the I.M.F. and GATT which would, almost certainly, lead toretaliation.    It might well put an end to E.F.T.A.    It could wellaggravate the difficulty of obtaining support for the pound and doserious damage to confidence in sterling,/Ik,-k-TOP SECRET
14.   The position in GATT is that quantitative restrictions mighthave &quot;been tolerated in the past two years to deal with balance ofpayments difficulties which were regarded as temporary.    Butinstead we chose the import charge (claiming that it was preferable to q..r.) and we have kept it for as long as a &quot;temporary&quot; restrict-ion would normally be justified.   Conceivably we might obtain fur-ther tolerance in the GATT if the I.M.F. were satisfied that thetotality of our measures acting on the balance of payments wouldenable us to achieve equilibrium within a reasonably short spaceof time.    If we resort to q.r. both they (and others) may wellconsider that our other measures will not be effective.   their confidence is already badly shaken by the fact that we shell re:1succeed, in getting into balance in the course of 1966 without theimport charge.    Some of our partners in GATT would therefore besure to retaliate by taking counter measures against our exportsc15.   A special difficulty would arise in E.F.T.A. where the free trade area is due to come into force on 1st January 1967.Article 19 of the Stockholm Treaty permits the use of q.reexceptionally - but only for a specified period of 18 months.(This would be regarded as having begun in October 1964 andas expiring last April.)   After that period other &apos;countries areentitled to retaliate, e.g. by reimposing tariffs or q.r.on U.K. exports.     The imposition of q.r. by the U.K. comingafter two years of the import charge, would destroy the wholebasis of E.F.T.A.     Discrimination in favour of E.P.T.A. wouldin practice be impossible because of the attitude of our creditors,who rejected such a move when the t.i.c. was.imposed in October,1964.-5- /16
1 Pfj16.    In short, the international difficulties we have had with theimport charge these past two years would pale into insignificancecompared with the hostility we should expect to encounter &quot;by switchinto quantitative restrictions in the immediate future.17.   The effects of a move on confidence in sterling would depend onnany factors.    Such drastic action would have to he justified by reference to the seriousness of our balance ofpayments situation,which could in itself tend to undermine confidence.    On the otherhand, mild action or inaction could also damage confidence, as being an inadequate response to the balance of payments situation.   Foreignopinion might differ somewhat between those observers who are primarily concerned with trade, and those who are primarily concernedwith finance.   But disappointment over our inability to fulfil our undertaking to be in balance at the end of 1966, the risk o3? threat of retaliation, and the likelihood of acrimonious debate in inter-national bodies, would all be a source of great risk to sterling.The course most likely to command confidence is an effective packagewhich, by definition, does not require the addition of directrestraint of imports.18.   The continuation or intensification of the temporary charge on imports would be administratively far easier than the imposition of quantitative restrictions. Ministers have decided in April that theretention (and a fortiori an increase) in the rate of the temporaryimport charge would be unacceptable.   Yet it seems likely that despitpast experience the continuation of the temporary import charge would if anything, arouse less international hostility than a switch toquantitative restrictions.19. An import deposit scheme might be tolerated under the rules ofthe   GATT and the International Monetary Fund, and would raise much/less- 6 -
less animosity than q..r., hut it would mean convincing othercountries that it was not being applied so as to afford protection to domestic production.    It would also be necessary to convince theI.M.F. that the deposit was not a prior exchange deposit whichwould be contrary to the I.M.F. Articles.Restraint by persuasion20.   The possibility of a modern version of the Buy Britishcampaign (with a different title) has also been considered.   before making any recommendation we need to seek advice from publicityexperts   and from the retail trade on how the public would respond to a campaign and whether it would be worth the cost.    It wouldseem undesirable for the Ministerial statement to refer to thepossibility of launching a formal campaign which would take aminimum of three months to prepare.    On the other hand the statementnight well include a sentence to the effect that:  &quot;Everyone can help the country by taking care over what he or she buysj   Britishproducts should always be bought when they are of good value evenif their prestige is less than that of goods from overseas1&apos;.Department of Economic AffairsJAth July,.1966 II
