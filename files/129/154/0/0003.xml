DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC JviAJESTYfS GOVERNMENTCF(70) 103 COPY NO      gg10 November 1970CABINETSUPPLEMENTARY BENEFITS FOR AND PA YE REFUNDSTO STRIKERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome department the Social Services Committee and the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy and the Ministerial Committee on Industrial Relationshave together considered possible changes in the law relating to thepayment of supplementary benefit and of PAYE refunds to strikers.    Atpresent when a man is on strike he may not receive supplementary benefit for his own requirements, but only for his dependents, and supplementary benefit is not normally payable at all for the first 2 weeks of a strike since they are covered by last wages.    At the end of a strike supplementary benefit may be paid for up to 2 weeks to tide the employee over while he iswaiting for his first wage packet, and at this stage his own requirement is payable.    During a strike up to  4. 7s of a strikerfs personal resources(mainly PAYE refunds and strike pay) are disregarded for the purposes ofassessing benefit to his dependants.    After the strike tax refunds are wholly disregarded.    It would not be possible in the present structure ofPAYE to eliminate refunds in the course of the tax year.    Thought is being given, for general reasons, to changing the system from a cumulative to anon-cumulative basis; this would obviate refunds until after the end of the tax year, but it is a long term possibility.    All that could be contemplatedas an immediate measure is the deferment of refunds till after a strike.2.    The Commfeiftes recommend 2 changes in the present law.    First,the amount of a striker !s personal resources disregarded in the assessment of supplementary benefit for his dependants during a strike should bereduced from  4.7s.   to  1.     The present disregard of  4. 7s depends onpractice; and in 1968 the then Law Officers found it not justified in law, inthat the amount disregarded was exactly equivalent to the requirement ofwhich the striker was supposed to be deprived under the supplementary benefit trade dispute disqualification.    The reduction of the disregard to 1 would be in line with the usual treatment of personal resources incomputing a payment of Supplementary Benefit.    Legislation would be needed to make this change since the Supplementary Benefits commission could not be expected to take the responsibility for such an evidentlypolitical measure.    The effect on the number of strikes would be onlymarginal, but the change would go some way to meeting the public^ dislike1
of benefit for strikers&apos;dependants.    Secondly, the Committeesrecommended that Supplementary Benefit should no longer be payable asa matter of course after the end of a strike; that any exceptional payments made in cases of hardship should be recoverable by the employer.    the remedy for an employee who is out of funds after a strike is to obtain a&apos;sub&apos; from his employer.    A tsubs is an advance on taxed income and itis an evident misuse of public funds that the State should make the employee a tax free irrecoverable gift after a strike.3.     These are substantial measures.    They will arouse hostilityamong unions, but they are defensible as just.    The Committeesconsidered 2 other proposals; that the refund of PAYE should be deferred until after the end of a strike and that Supplementary Benefit payable for astriker&apos;s dependants during a strike should be recoverable after thestrike was over.    These proposals are linked in that there is no pointin deferring the PAYE refunds if the result is to be an additionalirrecoverable burden on Supplementary Benefit (though equally, ifbenefit is made recoverable, deferring refunds would mean that anincreased amount would have to be recovered).    We thought that defer-ment of PAYE refunds could not be justified on grouxids of principle.Supplementary benefit is a payment by the State, but the PAYE refundis a refund of the employee&apos;s own money.    It is true that an unemployedman cannot get his refund as quickly as a striker because the striker isstill on his employer&apos;s books and the unemployed man is not; but that isnot a sound reason for delaying the refund to the striker.4.     The conversion of Supplementary Benefit payable for a striker&apos;sdependants during a strike from a gift into a loan by requiring it to berecoverable afterwards would operate on only a small minority of strikes.    Only 10 per cent of strikes last longer than 2 weeks, and onlya minority of strikers involved in longer strikes receive benefit.    Thechange might encourage unions to exhibit a greater sense of responsibilitytowards strikes, but its effect in this direction is only marginal; indeed it might encourage the short guerilla strike and working to rule.    Theopposition would be very great.    The change might involve resignationsfrom the Supplementary Benefit Commission on the grounds that theprinciples of the scheme were being distorted; it would involve a lingeringsense of bitterness (and possibly non-compliance) after the settlement ofa strike, particularly as the continuing burden of weekly deductions forthe purpose of repaying what might amount to substantial sums would fallon those least able to bear it; and there is a danger that the measure,whose bark would be markedly worse than its bite, would appear merely to be vindictive.-5,     We have considered whether it would be practicable to distinguish between official and unofficial strikes for the purposes of financialdeterrents, but have reached the conclusion that it would not.    We should propose that the 2 changes recommended in paragraph 2 above should be thesubject of a special Bill and should not be included in the industrial relations Bill.    The special Bill would deal also with a few ancillary2
matters such as the recommendation g  the Donovan Commission on the definition of a striker for the purposes of unemployment benefit andabatement of Supplementary Benefit for those who have l^st their jobsthrough industrial &quot;misconduct&quot; (the latter does not concern strikes).6. We invite our colleagues to approve the recommendations in this paper.R m home Office, SW110 November 1970I3
