DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70)U4 COPY NO    CQ4 December 1970CABINETTHE FUTURE OF THE MONOPOLIES commission memorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industryand President of the Board of trade. My colleagues already have before them the report by the Secretaryof State for Employment on the discussions in the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy.2.        This paper supplements CP(70) 95.    First by way of comment on paragraph 3 of that paper, second by setting out my views on the outstanding issues on the investigation of mergers and initiation of enquiries, and thirdby outlining what I should like to do in the interim period before v/e canlegislate.COMMENT ON PARAGRAPH 3 OF CP(70) 963.        I am in general agreement with the specific measures there set out.But I think we should reserve final judgment at this stage on b. and e. inthat paragraph.4.        On the question of efficiency studies of nationalised industries I seethe force of the argument that we should have an instrument of this kind which would look regularly but Infrequently at these industries, and that without it we shall be under constant pressure to have them investigatedhaphazardly and much too often.    But the Monopolies Commission have no present power to do this and it could, therefore, only take place on a voluntary basis.    I am. not sure what the prospects of agreement on thiswould be at the moment and It might be premature to pursue it until we havemade more progress with our general review of relationships between the nationalised industries and the Government.5.        I should also like to think further about the assets test.    I am not atthis stage wholly convinced about the need for such a test at all and whether,if we have one,  10 million is the right figure.    I see no need to commit ourselves at this stage on something which is relatively minor and whichcould profitably be the subject of consultation with the Confederation ofBritish Industry (CBI) and others.    (There is power to vary the amount by statutory instrument if we wish).1
6.        Finally, on a point not mentioned in paragraph 3 of CP(70) 96, there could perhaps be a question whether labour practices should come withinthe scope of the Commission.    I am not advocating this now but we should at least review the situation when the time for legislation approaches.INVESTIGATION OF MERGERS7.        On balance I believe that it would be right to retain the power torefer mergers to the Monopolies Commission but my present view is thatthis power should only be exercised where there is a clear prospect thatcompetition in the relevant market (which might be the international market)would be restricted to a damaging degree as a result of the merger.    Sizealone should never be the sole criterion for action against a merger,though it may be a contributory factor increasing the damage to the publicinterest which a merger might otherwise involve.    At this stage, it doesnot seem essential to take a final view on the manner in which in future legislation the statutory criteria for reference of a merger should be framed.    I see some advantage in leaving this for consideration in thelight of experience.INITIATIVE FOR REFERENCES8.        I am sure that for the foreseeable future the Government must makethe final decision on whether a reference should be made or not.    But Ibelieve that the Monopolies Commission now and the new Commission inthe future could usefully play a significant part in the consideration of matters suitable for investigation, and I think it would be right to invitethem in the period before legislation to propose suitable subjects for formalenquiry which they could make known publicly if they wished.    Of courseas the Commission builds up information about situations of imperfectcompetition it will be better and better placed to offer objective advice and suggestions.    This will go a long way to meet the objectives underlying theproposal in the 1964 White Paper for appointment of an independent Registrar;the aim of this was to remove the selection of references further from theinfluence of political and other pressures, but there would have been some difficulties in practice which the proposal to place a greater responsibility on the Commission itself will avoid.    A Registrar would have been in a difficult position as an independent officer, not responsible either to a minister or to Parliament, and having to operate without any statutoryguidance on the criteria he should apply (unlike the Registrar for RestrictiveTrading Agreements whose responsibility for referring restrictiveagreements to the court are clearly defined in the legislation).INTERIM ACTION9,        The proposals set out in CP(70) 96 together with those in this paperamount to a substantial programme for revitalising the monopolies commission and extending the scope of legislation to achieve a more effective competition policy.    But we would be unwise to commit ourselves2   &apos;
now in detail to the terms of legislation which is some way off.    Equallywe should move as far as we can under existing legislation in the transitional period towards Implementing the general policy for which legislation would provide.    This would not only demonstrate our determination to create a more competitive environment but also make it possible for the Commission to start transforming itself Into a moreauthoritative and effective body which we want to see.    Existing legislationdoes in fact offer a good deal of scope,10. The attached draft statement sets out what I should like to say at thisstage on future policy and interim action.11.       I would draw attention to the proposal in paragraph 5 of the draft statement that I should announce an intention to make a number of monopoly references to the Commission soon.    It is idle to talk of strengthening the Commission and promoting a more competitive climateunless the Commission is, and is seen to be, actively engaged in looking at situations where competition is damagingly restricted,    I arn sure I can rely on my colleagues to help rne settle quickly a balanced programme of references.CONCLUSION12.       I ask my colleagues to endorse the proposals in this paper and theterms of the draft statement attached,13.       I will explain to the Chairmen of the nationalised industries inadvance of the statement those areas of our policy which concern them,14,       There is also a commitment to consult with the CBI and other national associations.    In the main such consultation must be on the detailed proposals for legislation rather than on the outlines of policycontained in the statement, but I think it would be desirable to show the cbi the statement in draft - some of our ideas will certainly be unwelcome to them.J d department of Trade and Industry SW14 December 1970
ANNEXCONFIDENTIALDRAFT STATEMENT OF MONOPOLIESWith permission, I should like to make a statement about theneasures which the Government are taking to strengthen the machineryfor promoting competition in industry, and for providing safeguards against the abuse of market power.2.       We shall in due course introduce legislation to re-shapethe Monopolies Commission, to widen its scope and powers, and tomake it more effective.   Meanwhile, within the scope of the existing legislation, we shall make important changes of practice which willforeshadow the legislative proposals we shall eventually bring forward, and set the Monopolies Commission on a course enabling asmooth transition to be made to the new Commission which will replace it.3.       In the transitional period we shall increase and strengthen the staff of the Commission, and appoint additional full time member as necessary.4.      The Commission will he encouraged to become the expertand authoritative source of information to the Government onsituations of imperfect competition, and I shall be ready toconsider proposals from them of possible subjects for formalenquiry.   The power to make references will remain with me, butI shall have no objection to the Commission making their proposalspublic if they so wish.5-       To enable shorter enquiries to be undertaken in appropriate cases the Commission will be asked so far as is possible within theexisting legislation, to direct its attention to specific issues asalternative to the traditional wide-ranging monopoly enquiry.i0r example, the Commission may be asked to investigate a particularPractice by a company or industry, or to report on prices in amonopolistic situation.   I hope, too, that these limited enquirieswiU permit simpler procedures to be adopted.
g,       I intend to make a number of references in the near future.I shall continue to use the power to refer proposed mergers to theCommission if I consider that competition in the relevant market would be restricted to a damaging degree as a result of the merger.I shall also hope from .time-to-time to issue guidance on theprinciples being followed in making references to the Commission.7,       The Commission has in the past been used to enquire onlyinto the activities of private industry.   In future, I shall beready to make use of the power in Section 2(2) of the monopolies and Restrictive Practices Act, 1948 to ask the Monopolies Commissionto give me information and assistance on questions arising out ofthe operations of publicly owned enterprises which are in a monopoly position.   But I shall bear in mind the need to avoidburdening those industries with a wholly unreasonable successionof investigations as has happened in the past.8.       These measures will start to strengthen the authority ofthe Commission at once, and to make it a more effective body for promoting competition throughout the economy.   But the Commissioncannot be fully effective in the new directions I have outlinedwithout legislative changes.   In preparing such legislation we shallaim in particular to provide for a reconstituted Commission;   for appropriate new powers to collect information and to  proposeenquiries;   and for its powers of formal enquiry to be extendedto cover public monopolies such as nationalised industries andother   statutory trading bodies which are in a monopoly position.9.      The Government are also reviewing the restrictive trade practices legislation with a view to extending its scope and making it more effective.    In particular, we shall be consideringthe case for bringing services within the legislation, for makingregistrable certain anti-competitive practices by single firms,^d for making certain types of restrictive agreement illegal.CONFIDENTIAL
I shall be discussing these matters with representative nationalassociations with a view to bringing forward legislative proposals in a later Session.
