OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY lS government cp(70) 111 COPY NO      r p25 November 1970CABINETFINANCES OF MERSEY DOCKS AND HARBOUR board memorandum by the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentCabinet last discussed this subject on Friday 13 November(CM(70) 37th Conclusions, Minute 6).    Further discussions have brought us to the point where there are. two possibilities s-i.     The users, alone or possibly with some contribution from the Government, v/iil put up funds to meet the Board&apos;scash requirements until their Bill is through; orii,     the Government seeks the appointment of a receiver,CURRENT situation, The users are still considering whether they will put up somebridging funds in the form of an extra levy on charges. We may not know the final answer this week.3. The Board have prepared for publication on Friday (the last date for introducing a Private Bill without special leave);-ia. a short Bill providing for a two-year moratorium ofcapital repayments and a temporary reduction in interest payments, together with interim changes in Board membership,all the appointments to be made by me;b, a draft statement explaining their intentions, including afurther Bill to write down their fixed interest capital debt by30 per cent and to create equity share capital to replace the written-down portion as well as the creation of a StatutoryCompany.4.     This statement says that the Board is &quot;still exploring ways ofobtaining sufficient finance to meet its commitments including maturingBonds&quot;.5.     It is hoped that a statement on these lines will hold the positionuntil a final decision is taken, and that the publication of the Board&apos;bill and statement will not provoke action by other creditors.1
A. IF BRIDGING LOANS ARE AVAILABLE6.      In this case, it will merely be necessary for suitable publicannouncements to be made, including the Governments preparedness toprovide further loans for Seaforth and other capital worke,B. IF WE HAVE TO APPLY FOR APFOINTMENT OF A RECEIVER7.      In this case, the first step must be for the Board to issue afurther statement that they will be unable to meet their cash commit-ments after the end of the year.    This would be triggered off by thefinal refusal to provide bridging loans,8,      This will provide the necessary evidence upon which theGovernment could apply for the appointment of a Receiver on the grounds that their security was in jeopardy,9,      Officials have already obtained informal indications from theBoard&apos;s officials and advisers that they would advise the Board not to oppose the application.    Subject to their own Counsels advice, it seems that the Board might also agree to co-operate in resisting attempts byother creditors to get at the assets needed for running the port,10.    Against this background the necessary steps appear to ber-a. Board informed of refusal to provide bridging loans butasked to co-operate in appointment of a Receiver, aad flectionof sow Chairman and Executive Committee?b. Board announce their insolvency;c. Government issue writ for appointment of Receiver andserve writ with Notice of Motion on the Board;d. Government make a statement dealing with:-i.     reasons for seeking appointment of a Receiver;ii.    Board&apos;s agreement to new Chairman and ExecutiveCommittee;iii*    Governments agreement to provide loans forSeaforth and other capital works^iv.    Governments willingness, if necessary, to coverBoardie obligations to pensioners,    (NOTE,    We would!have to accept this liability as well as the possible need to make loans for other essential expenses not allowed bythe Receiver, and an indemnity for the Receiver againstliability, other than through negligence,)2
CONCLUSION11.    I have set out above the tv/o alternative courses of action open tous.    If the users inform me that they are unwilling to make any contribution, and on the assumption that we are not prepared to providethe whole of the bridging finance, I seek my colleagues&apos; agreement to set in hand the action for the appointment of a Receiver.12,     In the meantime we also need to decide whether to accept that Ishould make all the appointments to the reconstituted Board, as an interim measure, as proposed in the board&apos;s Bill to be deposited onFriday.IP w department of the Environment SWl25 November 19703
