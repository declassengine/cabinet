DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(70)108 COPYNP r,70 i18 November 1970CABINETGAS AND ELECTRICITY prices memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services.        The Cabinet (CM(70) 35th Conclusions, Minute 2) asked for furtherconsideration to be given to the possibility of mitigating the effects of price increases in gas and electricity.    This nofca sets out prcpoJK&amp;ls tor a. minorbut laacfui Gts&amp;p which will help those recipients of supplementary benefitwho are most vulneiable.2,        Normal heating requirements are met by the basic rates of benefit which were increased on 2 November.    The rate of the single householderwas increased by 8.3 per cent to  5 4. 0. against an increase in the retail price indeat (Js;3S housing which is met by rent addition) over and abovethe basic rates of about 6 per cent since the previous uprating inNovember 1959.    There is thus still a small margin from which futureprice increases can be met.    I understand that the increases for electricityenvisaged in CP(70) 107 would probably add between Is 6d and 2s Od to thebudget of a pensioner who makes come use of electricity for heating.3.        I do not think that any general increase in benefit would be justifiedto meet these higher prices.    Such an increase, between annual upratings,could only take the form of a lump sum, similar to the  4 bonus providedby the last Administration at Christmas 1964.    The bonus went to allsupplementary pensioners and to restricted categories (eg the chronicallysick and those with very young children) among younger recipients ofsupplementary benefit.    It cost  6 million.    The same bonus today would cost  8 million or, if it were raised to  5 to take account of rising prices, 10 million.4.        I must advise against any repeat of that operation for the following main reasons -a.        The 1964 bonus came when there had been no uprating for18 months and supplementary benefit rates had fallen well behind the rise in the cost of living.    The situation today is entirely different, since there has just been an uprating which still leaves1
a margin over price risen.    If we provided a bonus on fhe grounds of general rises in prices in these circumstances, there would beno defence against demands for a similar bonus at the beginning ofany winter when prices were rising.b. E alternatively we provided a smaller bonus specifically tomeet rises in gas and electricity prices, this would be an evenmore dangerous precedent, since it would expose the Governmentto claims for compensation for successive rises in the price ofeach basic commodity as they occurred.    And it would ignore thefact that those on supplementary benefit, taken as a whole, are moredependent on coal, of which the price for domestic consumers hasnot gone up this winter, than on gas and electricity together.c. Given that those on supplementary benefit have just received an uprating while national insurance pensioners have not, weshould probably come under strong pressure to extend any bonusto the latter on this occasion, at vastly increased cost.5.        There is however a less far-reaching step which we could take tohelp those on supplementary benefit who are in the greatest need of extraheating.    Some 150, 000 (between 5 per cent and 6 per cent of all claimants)receive special heating additions because they are in poor health or badaccommodation.    At present the amount of the addition is based upon thelocal price of ^ cwt of coal, or g cwt in more serious cases.    The average weekly amounts are 4s and 8s respectively.    The annual cost is approximately  1.5 million.6.        The Supplementary Benefits Commission have proposed that thisscheme should be substantially improved bya. changing the basis of the calculation.   In place of the priceof coal as a baseP we should take the figure of 20c (representingthe notional element for normal heating expenses within the basicscale)j this sum would be varied in future by reference to the fuel group of the Retail Price Index, which covers all forms of fuel;b. substituting three new rates of jj (5s), \ (10s) and -f (15s) forthe two present rates of \ and \,    The new 15s rate would coverexceptional cases of acute need;c. applying the new rates by a new set of criteria which would bring quite large numbers of new beneficiaries into the field (forexample, whereas a person now has to be house-bound to qualify,in future he would qualify if his mobility was severely restricted byill-health).The cost of the improvement would be up to  3f million in a full year.2
7.        This scheme will take 6 months to implement? if a start ismade in January (possible only if the decision is taken at once),conversion to the new rates will be complete by the end of June.    Thismeans that only one-half of the beneficiaries will be receiving higher rates before the end of the winter.    The reason for this is that the conversion can only be made on the issue of a new order-book, sinceeach case would be individually reassessed, involving a visit to theperson^ home in a fair number of cases.8.       I have considered whether a simpler version of the scheme could be introduced more quickly.    Three possibilities have beencanvas sed:-a. To leave the coal-basis and the present criteria asthey are, and simply pay a lump sum to all currentrecipients of special additions.    But this invites direct andunfavourable comparison with the 1964 scheme with itsmuch wider coverage.    It is also a stop-gap covering onewinter onlyv    If we do not start on the supplementary benefits Commission^ scheme now, it will have for technical reasons to wait until after the 1971 uprating, when we shall bein exactly the same position as we are now.     No new cases would be covered, there would be no major improvement forany current recipient and nothing would have been done to putheating additions on to a better and more rational basis forthe future.b. Tc pay a lump sum to those dependent on gas and electricity only.    But this is impracticable.    the supplementary Benefits Commission do not know who theyare, and complex arrangements would be needed to be fair to those who depend partly on electricity and partly on coal.And it runs up against the fatal objection in paragraph 4 hsabove.c. To pay additional weekly sums of ls* and 2s. to allcurrent recipients of special additions.    But these sumslook very mean and the solution is still only a stop-gap,with the disadvantages described at a. above.    It is alsoopen to the further objection that regulations under theMinistry of Social Security Act 1966 prohibit adjustments of this size except on the occasion of the issue of a new order-book.After full consideration, I conclude that none of these devices could be satisfactory.3
9.      It is clear that the scheme proposed by the supplementary benefits Commission is not designed directly to mitigate the effects of the proposed price rises this winter - a purpose for which it was never intended.    I would not propose to present it in that light,    Butit represents a genuine long-term improvement for those whose needs for extra heating are greatest and will demonstrate our practicalconcern for them at a time when the increases in gas and electricityprices will draw public attention to their needs.    I hope that mycolleagues will agree to its adoption.K department of Health and Social Security, SEl18 November 19704
