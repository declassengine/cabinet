DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 101 COPY NO2 November 1970CABINETIMPROVED EXPENDITURE DECISIONS BY government memorandum by the Lord Privy seal. The Business Team, who took up their appointments as advisers tothe Government soon after we came to office, have now produced their first report.    It deals with improved expenditure decisions by Governmentand is the work of three members of the team, Mr, East, Mr. Fogg andMr, Meyjes.    A copy is attached.2.        The Business Team found in their discussions with both ministers and officials a wide measure of readiness for change and support for the objectives of their approach of which a brief account was given in the annex to the Note circulated by the Prime Minister (CP(70) 72),    Thereport has been discussed intensively at meetings which the team have held in several Departments and at a meeting of Permanent Secretariesunder Sir William Armstrong.    In this paper I am, with the PrimeMinisters approval, setting out the main proposals for considerationby the Cabinet.PROGRAMME ANALYSIS AND REVIEW3.        In the course of the annual public expenditure survey processDepartments submit reports in February of their estimated expenditurein the financial year then about to begin and forecasts of costs of continuing with existing policies together with known changes foreach of the following four years.    These reports are totalled and related by the Treasury to economic forecasts, and after intensivediscussion with Departments individually and in the Public expenditure survey Committee (PESC) a report is put to Ministers in June for themto confirm expenditure decisions for one and two years ahead and to makeprovisional decisions for three and four years ahead.    This comprehensivesurvey acts as a powerful instrument of demand management and financial control and provides much of the information that Ministers need to enablethem to balance the claims of competing blocks of public expenditure.However, there are two important respects in which it does not provide -indeed, does not claim to provide - all the information that would be
^Jesirable for this purpose.    It does not call for explicit statements of the objectives of expenditure in a way that would enable a Minister^ plans tobe tested against general Government strategy; nor does it regularly embodydetailed analysis of existing programmes or of major policy options.    Thereare of course occasions during the public expenditure discussions each yearwhen individual Ministers explain their objectives and discuss policy options,and the PESC submissions are themselves based in part on studies in depthwhich are carried out ad hoc as the need for them is recognised: but thereis no framework for regular comparative review of objectives and policy options,4.        What is now proposed is a systematic strengthening, to meet theseneeds, of the basis on which public expenditure decisions are taken, by theintroduction into the annual survey cycle of a new stage known asprogramme analysis and review (PAR).    For this purpose each department will, it is proposed, eabmifc each year a programmereview for consideration by the Treasury and later by ministers in respect of their public expenditure programmes.    These reviewswill vary widely in content according to the circumstances of theDepartment and the nature of the expenditure over which it has controlbut it can be foreseen that they will, among other things:a. Review the current situation and impending developmentsaffecting it.b. Discuss the purposes and objectives of policy relevant tothe programmes under review.c. Analyse relevant options and assess priorities,d. Set out the major issues foreseen as emerging for decision,and make recommendations for depth studies and any other action required to clear the way for public expenditure decisions,5,        The reviews will be drawn up within the framework of the currentMinisterial decisions on public expenditure.    They will need to cover all of a Departments public expenditure programmes but there will be advantage in a selective approach according to which the review willfocus on key issues whether in terms of continuing programmes or ofnew policies.    It will be important to retain a large degree of flexibility,both as between Departments and from year to year, in the handling of thereviews,   ,6.        A programme review will be discussed with the Treasury in draft and will be the subject of development and further analysis in the light ofthis.    These discussions will be directed to clarifying the policyobjectives, and ensuring that all foreseeable consequences of eachprogramme have been taken into account and all worthwhile optionsidentified: also that the arguments and calculations are expressedin output terms wherever possible.2
7. ,      It is envisaged that both the Treasury and the Department will emerge from this process with a better understanding of the issues.The revised programme review will then be submitted by the responsible minister for discussion with his colleagues in the appropriate CabinetCommittee forum for the purpose of approval or amendment, withparticular reference to items b, c and d in paragraph 4 above.8.        Under this system Ministers should be in a position to seemore clearly the implications of the decisions that they must ultimatelytake in the field of public expenditure^    Better informed decisions will,let us hope, be better decisions.    There should be a benefit not only to ministers collectively when the programmes of different Departmentscome to be considered together, but also to individual Ministers seeking to determine priorities within their Departments - a consideration thatbecomes increasingly important with the tendency towards larger andmore wide-ranging Departments,,9.        The central policy review staff to be set up in the Cabinet Office,described in the Prime Minister&apos;s note CP(70) 37 and in paragraphs 44-48of the White Paper on the Reorganisation of Central Government(Cmnd. 4506), will have a role to play in the successive stages ofthe PAR process described above and especially at the stage whenthe individual Departmental reviews are being considered collectivelyby Ministers.    Although the Director &quot;-General has now been appointed,the new staff has not yet begun to function and, while I have no doubt thatits contribution to the PAR process will be a most valuable complement tothe work done in Departments and in the Treasury, it would be prematurefor me to try to set out here exactly what form this contribution might take.That need not prevent us however from considering PAR on its merits as outlined in the paragraphs above.implement a TION10.       As I have said there is a wide spread feeling of support for the objectives of the proposed PAR though it must be recognised that the extra work involved will throw a strain on Departments, and this isyet another reason for keeping the procedures flexible.    The BusinessTeam are convinced that their proposals are feasible; the improvementthat is to be looked for in the quality of decision-making is something thatwill never be susceptible of proof but on which I believe we must now make up our minds as a matter of judgment,    A firm decision now to introducePAR as proposed is, I believe, the way forward,11.        There will remain the extremely important and difficult task ofworking out in detail the common ground rules of the exercise and the framework, scope and scale of the programme review to be submittedby each Department taking account of its particular circumstances.This will occupy many months of intensive work in which the Civil
* Service Department and the Treasury will be deeply involved with departments.    The Business Team will play a part: it has beenagreed that Mr. East should act as Director of the PAR project,reporting to Sir William Armstrong, and that Mr. Fogg should workin conjunction with the Cabinet Office to establish the relations betweenthe new central policy review staff and the PAR process.Sir William Armstrong is also arranging to set up a committee with representation from the Business Team, the Treasury andcertain major spending Departments, to play a consultative role in the implementation.12.       Staffing arrangements will need careful consideration by departments: though the number of staff required to give the necessaryimpetus to PAR will not be large, the quality will have to be high and someDepartments will no doubt find it necessary to designate a focal point at a senior level - where this does not already exist - round which thenecessary skills can be assembled.    I fear that we have no choicebut to operate within the existing staff controls and to think in termsof satisfying the requirements of PAR, if necessary by redeployment,within the established limits of staff number sa13,       It is proposed that, while the timing of the PAR cycle in relationto the PESC survey and report should ultimately be settled in the light of experience, planning should proceed on the basis of all Departmentsrendering programme reviews (in final form) in October 1971.    If time is not to be lost, early discussions should be entered into with departments on the form and content of the reviews: it may wellbe helpful in some cases if this takes the form of a Mummy run1earlier in the year, which could prove a valuable investment interms of better reviews in October,14,       I invite my colleagues to agree that a system of programme analysis and review on the lines proposed by the Business Team as summarised in paragraphs 4-7 above should be introduced, and toauthorise the Civil Service Department and the Treasury to startimmediate discussions with Departments to put it into effect.J civil  Service Department SW12 November 19704

PART   1     introduction.1        Scope of the ProjectThe purpose of the project was to find ways by which Governmentcould take better decisions about public expenditure.     To meet this purpose, we have considered the total system for determiningpublic expenditure, which includes the preparation of proposals by departments, their analysis by the public sector group of theTreasury, and their evaluation by the Cabinet.Better decision-making is only part of the wider need toobtain better value for public money.     This larger conceptalso embraces the management and control of performance, and hasbeen kept in mind during the project.1.2        Method of WorkingTwo members of the business team (Mr East and Mr Fogg) havebeen engaged full-time, and one member (Mr Meyjes) part-time.Detailed discussions were held with most of the senior membersof the public sector group of the Treasury, and subsequentlywith senior members of most departments.     During the work,discussions were also held with Treasury and departmental ministers, and with senior members of the Civil Service Department.The team is most grateful for the help it has received fromMinisters and officials, during a period when there were pressingdemands on their time.1.3        The Climate for ChangeEarly on in the investigation it became very clear thatsenior officials throughout Government were aware of the needfor development.     In many cases there were well thought-outideas for change.     The business team was quickly able to endorse these ideas, and thereafter to work with officials onthe steps needed for implementation.The need for change is accepted:   indeed there is an eager-ness for it.     The problems are those of exact method, of timing,of resources, and of training.     This report deals with these aspects, on which considerable progress has already been made.
CONFIDENTIAL- 2 -] .4        Contents of the ReportThe next Part (2) briefly reviews the present, system ofexpenditure control, and sets out its main strengths and weak-nesses.Part 3 gives a broad picture of the proposed new system,as it will be when in full operation, whereas Part 4 describes the interim situation whilst the new system is being introduced.Part 5 deals with some problems of organization and of staffing.     Part 6 sets out those matters which now requireendorsement or approval, and Part 7 summarises the benefits which will result as the changes become effective.
- 3 -PART   2     THE   PRESENT   POSITION,   AND   FUTURE   NEEDSThe Public Expenditure Survey Committee     (PESC)The main instrument of public expenditure control is thePESC system, which is described briefly as:-Each year, in the period from March to June, the departments&apos;returns are added together by the Treasury to compute or forecasttotal public expenditure for the year then beginning.     For purposesof comparison the PESC report shows the out-turn of the previous year, and of the one before that (corrected for changes in prices).The PESC report also shows, for each of the next four years,the forecast cost of continuing with existing policies, plusknown changes.For expenditure other than transfer payments to persons (whichcan be changed at relatively short notice), the PESC report for thecurrent year reflects decisions taken a year or two previously.When the report is submitted in June each year, Ministers are askedto confirm decisions for one and two years ahead, and to makeinitial decisions for three and four years ahead.At the time of the PESC returns, and throughout the year as necessary, the spending plans of each department are rigorouslydiscussed with the appropriate one of the Treasury&apos;s fiveexpenditure divisions.2.2        Features of the PESC System, and Current developments the PESC system is a means of linking total public expenditure to the management of the economy.     Its strongest features - andthese are widely admired in other countries - are that it looks at the parts in relation to the wholelooks ahead for several yearsexpresses expenditure in functional termsincludes all public expenditure.CONFIDENTIAL
- 4 -Considerable thought and time are being put into improving the input of data to the system, including:-i)    The Relative Price Effect is being studied, inorder to minimise inaccuracies caused by relative price changes.ii)   The quality of technical and demographicinformation is being improved, to reduce the element of guesswork, and to identify thedeterminants of expenditure.iii)    Some long-term studies have been started, to identify future issues for decision.iv)   Efforts are being made to get better and prompterdata, in those cases where central government isnot the spending authority.2.3        Requirements for a Modified system the main additional features needed to improve the systemare that it should:-i)   Make it easier for Ministers and their departmentstodetermine prioritiestest objectives-    analyse alternative meanscontrol performance.ii)    Be concerned with the objectives and outputs of proposals for expenditure.iii)   Provide for regular and detailed appraisal of departmental policies, plans and programmes, and allow Ministers to relate these to overallGovernment strategy.1 Iiv)   Allow for sufficient analysis and review ofconflicting or competing demands for resources.v)   Ensure that major policy issues are identified,before some of the options disappear with thepassage of time.vi)    Initiate long-term studies so that adequateinformation is available by the time decisionstiavc to be made.
- 5 -2.4        Types of Expenditure DecisionGovernment is called upon to take many types of decisions about expenditure, the three main ones belng:-a) Decisions to introduce new programmes intoexisting or new fields of activity.     Theseproposals need thorough analysis before decisions on them are taken at the time ofthe annual expenditure review.b) Decisions to continue, to stop, or to modifyexisting programmes, as there is a naturaltendency for on-going programmes to continue,unless there is provision for periodicchallenge.     Such challenges must also be part of the annual expenditure review.c) Decisions in reaction to events or to unfore-seen circumstances.     These may have to betaken at any time, and often urgently.A modified system must be a help to all three types of decision.
- 6 -PART   3     THE   MODIFIED   SYSTEM3.1        Programme Analysis and Review     (PAR)The essence of the proposed changes is to set up an improvedanalytical capability for all types of expenditure decision, to-gether with an annual review of foreseeable and on-goingprogrammes.     At present the PESC operation occupies part of theyear:   it is proposed to begin this with a period of programme analysis and review, which it may be found convenient to refer to as PAR.Hitherto public expenditure control has emphasisedconsideration of input, whereas the modified system will giveequal emphasis to consideration of output.     The public ex-penditure divisions of the Treasury will concentrate on PAReach Autumn, as a preliminary to PESC in the following Spring.In its initial stages the Public Expenditure exercise willconcentrate on objectives, policies and priorities, beforethe actual spending decisions are made in the latter stages.3.2        Special StudiesFor those decisions which fall outside the annual reviewperiod, Special Studies are proposed.     For some the need canbe foreseen and plans prepared, but there will always be others which are totally unpredictable.    For both types it remainsimportant to subject the proposals to detailed analysis, andto relate them to the PESC allocations.     In all respectsother than timing, therefore, they will follow the same pro-cedure as PAR, so the remainder of this section - althoughmentioning only PAR - should be read as applying to SpecialStudies.3.3&apos;       Outline of PARThe heart of the PAR system will be the Programme Reviews(PRs) prepared by every Government department.    A ProgrammeReview is an annual document through which each departmentseeks approval of its objectives and plans for expenditure.It includes a summary of all main programmes&apos; for which thedepartment is responsible.In the first stage of PAR, departments analyse their pro-grammes and prepare their PRs.     In doing this they shouldtake note of the most recent PESC allocations, of any knownoverall constraints, of the Government&apos;s overall strategy,and of their Minister&apos;s objectives.
- 7 -In the second stage of PAR, departments discuss their programmes in progressively greater detail with the Treasuryexpenditure divisions.     This process of analysis culminates,in October each year, in Treasury clearance of the ProgrammeReviews.     During this stage the Treasury are responsible formanaging the exercise.In the third stage of PAR, the PRs are submitted by ministers for consideration by Cabinet Committee, and where appropriate by cabinet.     During this stage the Cabinet Office are responsiblefor progress, though they depend on departmental and Treasurystaff for any further detailed staff work.After consideration by Ministers collectively each depart-ment receives a reply to its PR.     These &quot;ministers Replies&quot;set the priorities and give guidance for the preparation of thenext PESC submissions, in respect of the forthcoming and future years.3.4        Departmental Programme ReviewsA department&apos;s PR is primarily for the use of the Ministerand the department in planning, in setting priorities, and inserving their purpose.     Each department prepares its PR to suit its needs and conditions, and according to the issues which concern it, though certain common features are expected in all PRs.A PR, for example, must be comprehensive and summarisethe whole of a department&apos;s work:    all programmes must beincluded, though only the new ones and a proportion of the continuing ones would be subject to detailed analysis in any year.     The time horizon must be appropriate to the issues,whether this be five or ten or even twenty years.     A PR, also,should always contain five main sections:-1. Review of current situation, impending changes and the major issues needing decision.2. The policy and purpose of the department.3. Recommendations about existing and futureprogrammes.4.. Action required.5- Summary of recommendations.
CON I&apos;&quot; 1 I) E N T I A L- 8 -Appendix I to this report sets out more fully the information which would be covered in a typical PR, which would normally beof 15 to 25 pages.     As well as the spending departments, therevenue departments should prepare PRs about their managerialexpenditure.3.5        The Process of AnalysisAnalysis of the PRs, and of the underlying programmes, takes place in the departments and in the Treasury expenditure divisions.At each stage it consists of seeking answers to the six following questions:-i)   Does the PR wholly conform to revealed policy, or are there aspects which require confirmation?ii)   Are all the planning assumptions and constraintslisted and incorporated?iii)   Is the PR comprehensive?     Does it take intoaccount all foreseeable consequences of theproposed programmes, both for other programmes and for future years.iv)   Are the valid alternatives listed, and the worth-while ones studied.v)   Are there measureable criteria of success in reaching the objectives.vi)   Are the arguments and the calculations properlypresented in output terms?The process of analysis is likely to be a year-round one inmost departments.     The benefits will vary from department todepartment, but will always include enhanced ability to settlepriorities and to control performance towards the department&apos;sobjectives.     It will also put the Minister more directly in control of the activities for which he is responsible.The analytical, role of the Treasury expenditure divisionswill be to satisfy themselves that the analysis properly dealswith the six questions listed above.In cases where there are points of difference between theTreasury and a department, then these will be clearly statedso that when the Minister submits the PR   to his colleagues,the exact status is clear.     Such matters as queries over re-vealed policy or the consideration of additional alternativeswould have been advised to the Cabinet Office well in advance.
- 9 -3.6        Multi-departmental ProgrammesThere will be cases in which a group of programmes coversone subject, but involves activities by more than one depart-ment.     In such cases it will be the responsibility of theTreasury to combine the presentations as part of their PARwork.     (Note:    similar combinations are currently made duringthe PESC exercise, using established inter-departamental committees).It should be the responsibility of the Cabinet Office toobtain a decision on which Minister or Ministers should presentthe case for the combined activities.3- 7        The Cabinet Office (and the central capability)Before Ministers present their PRs to Cabinet committees or to Cabinet, there is a need for high-quality staff work bythe Cabinet Office.     One part of this staff work is thenecessary management of the exercise, which it is expected willbe the job of the Secretariat.,Another part of the staff work will involve the centralcapability unit, and in respect of PAR the unit is expected toserve Ministers and Cabinet byrelating each group of connected programmes tooverall Government strategy for each group of programmes, drawing out themain options and points for decisionadding any additional non-economic caonsiderations and evaluations to departments PRs.Throughout the PAR exercise, moreover, the centralcapability should keep in touch with and help departments andTreasury staff byclarifying and defining Government strategyin terms helpful to the formulation of de-par tmental policiesinforming them of any overall planningassumptions and constraints- drawing attention to future issues on whichdecision will be required, and which should therefore be reviewed.
- 10 -3.8        The Ministers&apos; RepliesIt is envisaged that about 10-12 groups of programmes willbe presented to the Cabinet Committees.     Each of these combinedpresentations should bo arranged to call for about two hours ofcommittee time.The outcome of the discussions is not a decision to spendmoney, as such decisions are taken following the PESC report.Instead the outcome is a Ministers&apos; Reply, which confirms (orotherwise) the objectives, policies and priorities put forward in the PR.     It covers the strategy and purpose of the departmentboth proposed and continuing programmesprogramme prioritiesmajor issues for future study.The Ministers&apos; Reply forms the principal guide to departments and to the Treasury expenditure divisions, in the remainder of thePublic Expenditure Survey.     Wherever possible this response by ministers should be a separate document, so that each PR ismatched by a Ministers&apos; Reply.3.9        Output BudgetingThere has been much debate as to whether Government should adopt output budgeting, also known as PPBS (a planning, programming,budgeting system).     The relation between our proposals and a PPMsystem is as follows.A full PPB system contains six main activities, being planning the objectives, Programming the work, Budgeting the resources,Financing the work, Accounting for expenditure, and Managing the activity.     Under our proposals there would be no change in thegeneral procedures for Budgeting, Financing and Accounting.There will be, however, marked changes in the Planning, Program-ming and Managing functions.From the very start of the new arrangements, all departments will be asked to Plan in greater depth, and to express their plans in Programme form.     It is expected that almost all de-partments will, in time, identify criteria of success and measuresof output.     However, the responsibility for performance does not always lie with departments, so that the direct Management functionwill be incomplete in many cases (leaving only the indirect res-ponsibility to Monitor).......- fi f) Tf T T   Ti TH T ft Ti
- 11 -The extension from Planning to Programming and Management will undoubtedly take three to four years - nor will the system ever be final.     A good system changes continuously to suit changing con-ditions.3.10      Functional CostsAmong the key items of information for any decision-maker, arethe comparative future costs of alternative methods of achievingobjectives.     These costs are required in a marginal form, and onan activity-related or functional basis, and until recently wererarely computed in Government departments.Departments should be encouraged to prepare such costs (and corresponding statistical data), to match their emerging programmestructures.     An early start is called for, as the preparation of cost data is a big job and will necessarily take a long time.In the meanwhile, it must be accepted that for many decisions,the true costs of the different alternatives simply will not beavailable.3.11      Management for Performance x .Good decisions are of no value, if they do not lead tocorresponding performance.     Accordingly there is a need forfeedback or reporting of actual performance, so that the out-come may be made to correspond with the intention, in those cases where Central Government is responsible.We reject the idea that the Treasury should be responsibleeither for obtaining performance or even for reporting it.   these should be departmental responsibilities.     However, Treasuryexpenditure divisions would have two functions in this area.   First,they should ensure that programme proposals have associated measuresof performance, and a means for feedback.     Secondly, when analys-ing programme proposals, the managerial success of previous programmes should be taken into account.1 1 - &apos;The responsibility for monitoring input lies with the Treasury.The responsibility for output, and for getting value for money lies with the department.     A Minister and his department are concerned to achieve certain objectives.     Under the modified system, thoseobjectives will be subject to analysis and indeed to challenge.Once the objectives are approved, then they will be easier to attain.     The allocation of resources can be more rational, andthe management of performance can be made easier.
- 12 -PART   4     INTRODUCING   THE   CHANGES4-1        The First Programme ReviewsIt is recommended that work should start at once on the firstPRs, with a view to carrying out the first PAR in October 1971.During the next few months, departments and the Treasuryexpenditure divisions would work together on these PRs.     As thevalue and quality of PRs can improve with iteration, it is very strongly recommended that, wherever possible, a &quot;dummy run&quot; shouldbe held in May/June 1971.     Such a &quot;dummy run&quot; would help also to clarify the relative roles of the departmental staff, the Treasuryexpenditure divisions, and the central capability.The difficulties will be great, and the available inform-ation is in many cases limited, but the attempt should be madeto meet these targets.     Most effort should, of course, beapplied in those departments which spend most, or have major issues for decision.4.2        The Quality of Programme ReviewsAs aids for decision-making, the main needs in respect ofeach programme, area) A clear expression of the purpose and objectives,together with supporting arguments.b) The commitments which it implies for future years,and its effects on other programmes.c) The fixed and variable costs which will be involved in the coming and in future years.d) Demographic and other relevant environmentaldata.Experience in other countries (as well as in industry) hasshown that the information in (a) and (b) takes time to develop,and that its value is largely conditioned by the skill with whichthe whole &quot;family&quot; of programmes has been drawn up.     For the PRsin October 1971 some departments can have well-thought out programmestructures, because a start has already been made.     Others have notyet started, and may not have satisfactory structures before 1972.
- 13 -Likewise the information in (c) and (d) takes time toorganise.     Some departments have it available now:   in othersas long as two years will elapse before it is available insufficient quantity.Thus, in the early stages, PRs will be submitted in variousstates such asA Policies and issues, plus programmesstructure, plus cost and statisticaldataor   B Policies and issues, plus programmestructuresor   C Policies and issues only.In Appendix II, the various departments are reviewed showingthe state in which their PRs are likely to be during the next twoyears.     Provided a start is made well before the end of 1970, all departments could produce PRs of some value in October 1971, with increasing value in subsequent years.
14PART   5     ORGANIZATION   AND   STAFFING5.1        ImplementationIt is recommended that one member of the business team shouldbe engaged whole-time in the implementation.     He would work with treasury Ministers, and with the central and spending departments,with the following objectives:-i)   To progress the introduction of the PAR cycle,as described in this report.ii)   To ensure that the various departments are ableto play their proper parts in the PAR cycle.iii)   To ensure that the Treasury and the cabinet office are able to play their parts in PAR.iv)   To assist in setting-up the appropriate on-going PAR procedures and staff.5.2       Consultative CommitteeThe proposed changes will affect all departments (where thebulk of the work will be done), the Treasury expenditure divisions,and the Cabinet Office.     It seems appropriate therefore that a group should exist which can take a broad view of the implementationplans and progress.We recommend that a group should be formed with seniormembers ofthe Civil Service department-     the Cabinet office the Treasurytwo major departments-     the involved members of the businessteam.  &quot;
- 15 -5-3        Amendments to PARDuring this project our efforts have been concentrated onthe analytical capabilities of the departments and the Treasury,within the total system.     Discussions with the Cabinet office have been very limited.     In consequence our plans for the role of the central capability (so far as PAR is concerned) are lessformed than those relating to other parts of the system.     In-deed, it may prove advisable to amend slightly the role described in 3-7.Accordingly one member of the business team is now extend-ing the project to work out, with representatives of the various parties, the role of the central capability in PAR and PESC,vis-a-vis that of the departments and the Treasury.It is both inevitable and right that the PAR system shouldbe amended during implementation, as the varying needs and problems of departments and Treasury become more apparent.During the first year or so of operation some changes will certainly be found advisable, in timing, presentation, scopeor method.5.4        StaffingIf the proposals in this report are endorsed, then one ofthe first tasks of the businessman on PAR would be to preparedetailed staffing plans. The main needs in the first stagesare for senior planning staff, and for analysts. Later on as PPB systems are introduced, numbers of SEOs, HEOs, SystemsAnalysts and Computer Programmers will be needed for handlingdata (or their equivalent services purchased from outside sources).It is important to note the experience of other governments and Institutions over the use of planners and analysts.     Aperiod of two to three years in these positions should be normal and important features in the career of every bright young ad-ministrator or executive-     It has not been thought necessary or advisable to provide for life-time careers in either planningor analytical units.It is also recognised that there should be no increase indepartmental staff at this stage:   nor indeed is. this necessary,as we are convinced that departments already employ men of suit-able talents for these important tasks.     It is proposed asfollows:-CONFIDENTIAL
- 16 -i)   departments the first task would be for each department to select a man of suitable skills and standing tohead the PAR exercise.     He is likely to be ofDeputy or Under Secretarial rank, and would in turn select a small number of younger men forre-deployment as analysts.     The latter arelikely to be at Principal or Assistant Principallevel, with an analytical approach, numerate and able to express themselves clearly.ii)    Central departments the five Treasury expenditure divisions would need strengthening by some ten analysts in total.The Treasury MA unit would need strengthening by4-6 analysts and accountants during the implement-tation phase.     The central capability is expectedto need very few staff for this work, as the bulkof the staff work will be done by the expendituredivisions.Of this total of perhaps 20 extra officials, itis suggested that most should be transferred fromthe Management Services Unit and from the Govern-ment Economic Service.     Consideration should alsobe given to seeking secondment for a year of oneor two analysts from the Canadian Government.5.5        Training and PresentationIf the proposals of this report are endorsed, then thebusinessman on PAR would prepare training plans.     The main features would be:-i)   MinistersShort presentations would be given to Ministers,explaining their role in the new system, and itsadvantages to them.ii)   Senior OfficialsSimilar presentations would be prepared for Per-manent Secretaries, PFOs and Planning Officers,covering the system as a whole and their rolessln it.iii)   AnalystsSpecial training courses would be drawn-up for those men, probably drawing on overseas forassistance with the instruction.
17 -5.6        Programme ManagementAs more and more of a department&apos;s work is expressed inprogramme terms, there will be opportunities to improve themanagement or performance of its work.     A clearly definedprogramme, with its own budget, with criteria of success and measures of output, is the ideal basis for effective manage-ment.     This calls for the appointment of officials with authority to complete and responsibility for particularprogrammes.This proposal is not merely compatible with the FultonCommissions recommendations on accountable management, butcan be a major step in introducing them.     It is our viewthat without better management, the goal of better value for money will not be realised.C 0 N F I D E N T 1 A L
- 18 -PART   6    ACTION   REQUIRED6.1        Action Li.stThe following specific approvals and action are sought:i)   Endorse this report.ii)   Allocate responsibility for introducingPAR.iii)   Confirm the appointment of a businessmanto progress the introduction.iv)    Request all departments to start work ontheir first Programme Reviews.6.2        Consequential action as departments begin to express their policies, plans and priorities in programme form, there will doubtless be a need to consider to what extent, and how, and when these should be presented to Parliament.     It is recommended that these im-portant aspects should be the subject of a separate study.
- 19 -PART   7     IMPROVED   EXPENDITURE   DECISIONS7.1        The PAR - PESO system for proposed new programmes, and for on-going programmes, theaddition of PAR to the PESC system will allow Cabinet and ministers to take better decisions, for the following reasons:-i)   Expenditure proposals will be related toobjectives, in programme terms, and output-oriented.ii)   Proposals will be supported by better costand statistical information.iii) Proposals will have been rigorously analysed,and supported by tested argument at the threelevels oforiginating departmentTreasury expenditure divisionsCabinetiv)   Alternative means and ends will have beenconsidered.v)   Multi-departmental aspects will have been included.As at present, expenditure decisions will be taken within thePESC procedures:   as at present, these decisions will be takenwithin the context of the total available resources.     The maineffect of PAR will be to provide Ministers, both individually andcollectively, with a better basis for their decisions.For decisions whose action is dictated by events, SpecialStudies can incorporate some if not all of the above features,depending on the time available.     It is particularly importantalways to relate such Special Studies to the PESC allocations.C 0 N 1&apos;&apos; I  DENT I A L
- 20 -7.2       Summing-upThese proposals will involve a great deal of work, and it is appropriate to ask if the return will be worthwhile.     Certainlythere will be difficulties, such as the heavy load on officials in early years, and the current shortage of basic data.There are also some dangers.     Similar approaches by othercountries have shown that, if Ministers and officials are not fully committed, then the whole becomes an unreal or backroomexercise, and Programme Reviews mere catalogues.     Likewisethere are dangers in relying excessively on analysis, in going into absurd detail, or in trying to value the invaluable.Decisions, it must be stressed, are taken not by systemsbut by men and women.     Our studies have convinced us that ministers and officials now seek change, and that this is theright time for it.     To the extend that the challenge of change is grasped, it can lead to a more open style of decision-making, to better value for money, and to better Government.

C 0 N F I D E N T I A L- 24 -APPENDIX   IITHE   QUALITY   OF   PROGRAMME   REVIEWSFROM   DIFFERENT   departments as stated in Part 4.2, the first Programme Reviews will be ofvariable quality.     When the first ones are submitted in 1971, somedepartments will have available a complete hierarchy of programmes,supported by full cost and statistical data.     Others may be ableonly to review their policies and issues in broad terms.The table overleaf gives an approximate indication of thequality of the Programme Reviews, which may be available from thevarious departments.     This table is not in the nature of a fore-cast but rather should be used as guide as to the targets whichcould be set for individual departments.     It is also put forward as a reminder that there are very real difficulties ahead, whichwill take time to overcome.Note also, that the table treats each department as one entity.In practice in any department, some activities can quickly be thesubject of high-quality analysis, whereas others may take several years to complete.     In the initial stages, most PRs will be amixture of good and not-so-good analysis.There is no separate entry in the table for the nationalised industries, as these are the responsibility of several different departments.     The overall programme for these industries will beproduced during the PAR process.
