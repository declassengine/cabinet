DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF KER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(70) 125 COPY NO       [) 931 December 1970CABINETIMMIGRATION bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentINTR ODUCT OP-Y1. In our Manifesto we saidg-&quot;We will establish a new single system of control over allimmigration from overseas,,    The Home Secretary of the daywill have complete control, subject to the machinery for appeaL,over the entry of individuals into Britain,    We believe if: rightto allow an existing Commonwealth immigrant who is alreadyhere to bring his wife and young children to join him in thiscountry.    But for the future, work permits will not carry theright of permanent settlement for the holder or his dependants.Such permits as are Issued will be limited to a specific job in a specific area for a fixed period^ normally 12 months.    There will of course be no restrictions on travel.These policies mean that future immigration will be allowed onlyin strictly defined special cases.    There will be no further large scale permanent immigration.We will give assistance to Commonwealth immigrants who wish toreturn to their countries of origin* but we will not tolerate anyattempt to harass or compel them to go against their will&quot;.2,        The Immigration Bill is in an advanced stage of drafting.    In thismemorandum, I summarise its main provisions, and call attention to some particular points of difficulty,MAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BILL,i:3,        The BUI is drafted so as to carry out our undertaking to introduce a&quot;single system of control&quot; and to remove the automatic right of theCommonwealth worker to remain here once he has arrived,    But mycolleagues must appreciate that it is not possible to assimilate completely1
the treatment of aliens and Commonwealth immigrants! and indeed the manifesto does not commit us to this.    In some respects indeed it will benecessary to treat Commonwealth immigrants less favourably than aliens -and if we enter the European Economic Communities (e.c.) the discriminationwill become even more marked.    This stems from the fact that, in the main,aliens and Commonwealth Immigrants come to this country for differentreasons.    Cf the 50,000 aliens who come each year to work, half stay forless than 12 months,.    Only about 1 in 6 stay for 4 years and then settle! andthey do not bring in large numbers of dependants.    The Commonwealthimmigrant, on the other handv normally wants to ccme here to stay.    Thenumber of those admitted has declined sharply (see figures in Appendix I),but about 4, 000 voucher holders have recently been arriving each year.,All these, once admitted, are entitled to stay indefinitely, and have rights to bring in dependants.    Over the years, dependants have been coming inat the rate of about 2.7 per voucher holder.4.        At present Commonwealth citizens have certain statutory rights of entry (notably as voucher holders or as visitors or ae students) and thereIs also a statutory right of entry for dependants of Commonwealth immigrantsalready settled here.    The Bill will take away these rights - for which weshall be criticised.    Bet the undertaking in our Manifesto about dependantswill be safeguarded in the Immigration Rules, which will be ptublished as a white Paper when the Bill is presented.    These dependants will continue tohave a right of appeal if refused an entry certificate,5.        A Commonwealth immigrant admitted for employment will in futurerequire a work permit, for a specific job at a specific place.    It will bevalid for not more *han one year0&quot; He may have his stay extended while heremains in approved employment, and after 4 years he will (like an alien)be eligible to apply for the revocation of the conditions attached to his stay.Until then8 he will be required to register with the police,6,        The Bill will alter the appeal arrangements in two main respects;i. The provision of rights of appeal in security cases is unnecessary and contrary to the national interest.    The HomeSecretary should have an unfettered power, subject only to hisanswerabllity to Parliament, to exclude or expel any foreignnational or Commonwealth citizen where he has decided that this isconducive to the public good.    This is a view I had formed beforethe Rudi Dutschke appeal.ii. At present anyone arriving with a work permit, voucherp visaor entry certificate who is nevertheless refused entry can appealat the port.    It was the Intention of the Immigration Appeals Act 1969that anyone arriving without any of these documents who was refusedentry (eg as a vieitor) should also have a right of appeal at the port.The last Administration deferred Introduction of this latter form ofappeal? and the Bill will now provide that the right of appeal shall notbe exercisable while the passenger is in the United Kingdom.    Whenback in his country of origin, he will be in much the same position asa person appealing against refusal to issue a visa or entry certificate.2
7. A Commonwealth citizen or citizen of the Irish Republic now has an automatic right to be registered as a citizen of the United Kingdom and colonies on completing 5 years ordinary residence here.    The Bill willmake registration discretionary - on the lines of, but not identical with,naturalisation.8.        Appendix II gives fuller details of the contents of the Bill, Includingthe changes proposed in respect of deportation, and new offences and newpenalties.    The Bill will contain a provision dealing witn expenditure onrepatriation.    Since this is a topic on which we are likely to be challenged^I have set out my present proposals in seme detail in Appendix HI.PARTICULAR E5SUES9.        I now turn to three issues raising points of seme difficulty.a.        LIMITATION ON NUMBERS10.       How should we best limit the number of Commonwealth immigrants?We shall have to take some special steps.    Otherwise, assimilation to thearrangements for aliens would lead to an increased entry by commonwealth citizens.    Most of them would be well behaved, and could not be extrudedwithout harm to community relations in this countryc11.        Relevant factors ares-I, The Cabinet have already agreed on 26 November(CM(70) 41st Conclusions, Minute 6) that we should try for anagreement with Kenya and Uganda about the admission of east -African United Kingdom passport holders of Asian origin tothis country on the baris of doubling the present quota of lc 500 andhalving the inflow of about 4,000 Commonwealth voucher holders.ii.        It would seem right to allow doctors from the Commonwealth, to come In foff the ration1, as is already the position for aliens(although they come only in small numbers).ill.       It would also seem right to maintain a special quota for malta and the dependent territories.    Otherwise very few people would beable to come from these places.12.       E we keep to a maximum of 2, 000 work permits, as envisaged in theCabinet discussion on 26 November, and something like half are left formaltality and the dependent territories, this would leave a total of the order of1, 000 for the rest of the Commonwealth,    To keep the intake down to this figure, we have the alternatives of a numerical limit coupled with restrictivecriteria (as at present), or of depending solely on even more restrictivecriteria.    The Department of Employment think that we could probablyachieve our aim by giving work permits only to the following t-3CQMFSPENTBAl
a. Those holding professional qualifications and managerialand executive staff,b. Skilled craftsmen and experienced technicians,c        Specialised secretarial and clerical staff,d.        Those coming to do other skilled or responsible workwhich in the opinion of the Secretary of State for Employment isof substantial economic or social value tc this country.As with aliens8 permits would not be issued until the would-be employerhad first tried and failed to f111 the vacancy from resident labour here.No permits would be Issued to unskilled or semi-skilled commonwealth citizens.13.       The criteria suggested for Commonwealth citizens are stiffer thanthose for aliens? and we shall be criticised for discriminating againstthe Commonwealth,    But there is no escape from this, whether we have anumerical limit or whether we rest solely on restrictive criteria.    Thisresults from the differences I have already explained.    For example, ourhotels and restaurants would suffer badly if they could no: recruit foreignhelp.    But in the main the Spaniards. Italians and others who are recruitedfor this purpose do not come here with any intention of settling, whereas ifwe permitted hotels and restaurants to recruit say Indian or Pakistani staff,most of them would wish to settle here, and the problems of control wouldbe insuperable,14.       Later on, we may have to introduce an overall numerical limit(and to justify doing this for the Commonwealth but not for other countries)if we find that the application of the criteria in paragraph 12 do not keep thenumbers down to the required extent.    But I hope my colleagues will agreethat we should try this method,b.        THE OLD COMMONWEALTH15.       There is an arguable case, on kith and kin grounds, for special provision for those Commonwealth citizens who have an ancestral connectionwith the United Kingdom,    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryconsiders that resentment in the Old Commonwealth - especially Australiaand New Zealand - at being treated in the same way as aliens would damage our interests severely.    I am sympathetic, but it is not easy to devise ascheme which would not expose us to criticism, both in the New commonwealth and in this country, for discriminating between different members of theC commonwealth.16.       As the BD.1 is at present drafted, exemption from control on grounds of ancestral connection is restricted to those who are citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies.   A person born in Australia of a father born in the United Kingdom will himself be a citizen of the United Kingdom and colonies (as well as a citizen of Australia) and exempt from control; but not4
CO M FIDE NT! A&apos;so a person born in Australia but having a mother or a grandparent born inthe United Kingdom.    The straightforward way of extending exemptionwould be to provide that any Commonwealth citizen should be exempt if hehad a parent or grandparent bom (or naturalised and so on) in theUnited Kingdom,,17,       This would meani. that we would have no control over the entry of a possiblyvery large number of people, and could not deport any of themjii, that we would have trouble over Australians who can claimno ancestral connection but would be no less resentful of control;iii, that we should be giving an exemption to these large numbersat the same time as we are reaffirming control over some 250, 000United Kingdom passport holders; andiv. that there would be practical problems - the immigration officer could not be expected to determine at the port the truth of a claim by a person travelling on an Australian passport to have hada Scottish-born grandmother,18.       But while it is right to draw attention to these very real difficulties,my colleagues may well agree that an exemption provision based onancestral connection should be included.    If it wass it would, I fear, benecessary to require persons seeking exemption on grounds of ancestralconnection to apply for an entry certificate before starting the journey,.But no device will enable us to deal smoothly with the sort of person whowill not take the trouble to apply for an entry certificate.    Such people would have to be turned away and we would have to face the criticism thatwould result.19,       There is another problem arising in this same context - whetherstudents from the Commonwealth should be required to register with thepolice, like foreign students,    I do not think that it would be right towithdraw this requirement of registration from foreign students and soweaken the immigration control; and the police tell me that they areconcerned about Commonwealth students slipping into employment.    But if my colleagues thought it right, it would be practicable so to draw the Rulesas to avoid imposing the requirement of police registration on a commonwealth student (if accepted as a genuine student).    This would meanyet another distinction between Commonwealth and foreign countries, andone that would be very obvious.    Incidentally the Bill will not affect thepresent concession for working holidaymakers - mostly young Australiansand New Zealanders - who are technically visitors although allowed to stayfor up to 3 years in employment which can be regarded as incidental to aholiday.5
c.        VOTING RIGHTS20.       It Is for consideration whether the Bill should alter the law about theright to vote at Parliamentary and local elections.    Aliens have no suchright until naturalisation.    Commonwealth (and Irish) citizens have it assoon as included in the electoral register,21,       There are clearly arguments for giving no right to vote until theindividual has been registered as a citizen of the United Kingdom and colonies (paragraph 26 of Appendix EC), or at any rate until he has becomeexempt from control and accepted for permanent residence (normally after4 years in approved employment).    For the Irish, however, there is noprocedure parallel to acceptance for permanent residence? and one course might be to treat Commonwealth and Irish citizens alike by giving them the vote after 4 years1 residence.    If we were so to decide,, v/e shouldpresumably have to Introduce a similar qualification for membership of theHouses of Parliament and of local authorities.22.       But we are not committed to any such changes, and there arepractical objections to making them.    They could give offence to theCommonwealth, both Old and New,    Unlike Immigration control, theywould affect immigrants already here.    They would complicate any statement of voting rights (which must be simple to be understood) and cause confusion at the time of the electoral registration canvass.    It mightbe argued that v/e have no mandate to make changes in the franchise whichmight be to our electoral advantage, and there could be especially trouble-some controversy if inclusion of provisions about voting meant a v/ideextension of the scope of the Bill,23. I invite rny colleagues to consider whether the disadvantages outweigh the attractions,    Further details are grven inAppendbc IV,COST24.       The cost of the new arrangements, apart from repatriation, depends on the numbers of Commonwealth citizens whom we admit for employment,and the categories in respect of whom the police registration requirementis introduced.   Assuming entry for employment at about 2,000 a year, theadditional cost is estimated at rather under  400,000 a year (of which 350, 000 would fall on the Exchequer),    The additional manpower requiredin the first five years would be of the following order s-IIHome Office &quot;25Department of Employment -  30Police -   50 civilians, plus an unquantifiablecall on the time of police officers.(The figure would be less ifCommonwealth students are exempt from the requirement to register).5

I ask my colleaguesi. to note the main provisions of the Billii. to consider the arguments for and againsta. limiting entry by restrictive criteria (paragraph 14);b. making a concession for the Old Commonwealth(by exempting Commonwealth citizens with parental orgrandparental connections) (paragraph 18);c. exempting Commonwealth students from the requirement to register with the police (paragraph 19);d. changing the law about the right to vote(paragraphs 20-22),R m home Office SW131 December 19707

APPENDIX IIIMMIGRATION bill the Bill will replace the Aliens Restriction Acts 1914-19 andthe Commonwealth Immigrants Acts 1962-68 with a single code ofpermanent legislation on immigration control.     Within the generalframework of the control laid down in the Bill, the categories ofpersons from overseas who are to he eligible for admission to theUnited Kingdom and the conditions under which they are to beadmitted will be defined in &quot;Immigration Rules&quot; made by the HomeSecretary, of which a draft will be laid before Parliament when theBill is introduced.     The Bill will also amend in certain respects the provisions of the British Nationality Act 1 948 about acquisitionof citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies by registration.This note summarises the main matters to be dealt with in the bill and the immigration rules.IMMIGRATION CONTROL:    GENERALPersons subject to control2.     The following are to be exempt from immigration control byreason of their connection with the United KingdomsAny citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies who, or whoseparent or grandparentt-i.   was born in the United Kingdom;ii.   was naturalised in the United Kingdom;    oriii.   became a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies byadoption in the United Kingdom;    oriv.   became a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies byregistration in the United Kingdom.The burden of proving exemption is to lie on the person claiming it.Possession of a United Kingdom passport issued in the UnitedKingdom or to a British subject in the Irish Republic is, however, toke prima facie evidence that the holder (and anyone else included onthe passport) is exempt from control unless the passport is endorsedto the effect that he is subject to control.3.     The powers of control afforded by the Bill will apply to commonwealth citizens (except as mentioned in the preceding paragraph), British protected persons, citizens of the Irish republic and aliens.4.     It is not proposed to alter the present arrangements underwhich the United. Kingdom, the Channel Islands and Isle of Man andthe Irish Republic form a common travel area, and people are free to move from one part of the area to another without passing through an immigration control.     Power will be taken to ensure that persons
subject to control who enter the Republic from overseas, obtainadmission there for temporary purposes and then come to the UnitedKingdom cannot remain here permanently without Home Office approval.Visas and entry certificates5.     Nationals of certain foreign countries and Stateless personswill continue to need visas for admission to the United Kingdom(certain Stateless people are exempt from the visa requirement forvisits of up to 3 months and this will continue to be the position).No one will be admitted for settlement as a dependant unless heholds an entry certificate (if a Commonwealth citizen) or a visa orHome Office letter authorising admission.     Commonwealth citizenscoming as dependants of work permit holders will require entry certificates.Powers of immigration officers6.     A person subject to immigration control who seeks to enter theUnited Kingdom will be liable to be refused admission or to beadmitted subject to conditions.     These powers will be exercised byimmigration officers in accordance with the published immigrationrules.7.     The conditions which an immigration officer may impose underthe Bill will be as follows?a. a condition restricting the period for which the person concerned may remain in the United Kingdom;b. a condition restricting his employment or occupationhere;c. a condition requiring him to register with the police;d. a condition requiring him to report for medical examination;e. in the case of a person coming to the United Kingdom forthe purpose of joining the crew of a ship or an aircraft,a condition requiring him to leave on a specified shipor aircraft without specifying the date of departure.A condition of type b or ols to be imposed only in combination with one of type a.   A condition of type d is to be imposed onlyon medical advice.     (The main change from the present law is thatthere will be power to require a Gommonwealth citizen admitted fora limited period to register with the police.)Categories to be admitted8,     No one subject to immigration control will have a statutoryright to be admitted, but the Home Secretary will be required bythe Bill to publish and lay before Parliament general rules governing the entry of people to whom the Bill applies, and their control after entry.     The following paragraphs indicate the main categories of people who will be eligible for admission under therules for the control of entry.
a. United Kingdom passport holders9.     There will continue to be a quota of special vouchers for united Kingdom passport holders who are subject to immigration control;    and holders of special vouchers will continue to beadmitted for settlement, free of conditions, as will their dependants if they have entry certificates.b. Residents and their dependants10.   Any immigrant (Commonwealth or alien) who has been accepted for permanent residence in the United Kingdom - that is, has been admitted free of conditions or has had his conditions of admissionrevoked - will be able to return to the United Kingdom after anabsence of up to 2 years and to bring in, or be joined by, his wife, his children under 18 and his elderly parents, free of conditions.c. Holders of work permits11.   Persons subject to control who come to the United Kingdom for employment will be required by the immigration rules to hold workpermits, issued by the Department of Employment for a particularjob with a particular employer, except that there may be special arrangements for doctors and for others corresponding to commonwealth voucher-holders in Category B.     Holders of workpermits properly obtained will be admitted for the period specifiedin the permit (not exceeding 12 months), will need the permission of the Department of Employment for any change of employment andwill be required to register with the police (as will any peopleadmitted without work permits and subsequently allowed to takeapproved employment).     They may have their stay extended while they remain in approved employment, and after 4 years in approvedemployment will be eligible to apply for the conditions attachedto their stay to be revoked.     Generally the wives of permit-holders and their children under 18 will be admitted on the same conditions as the head of the family;   but other dependants(e.g. elderly parents) will not be admissible to join a permit-holder unless and until he is accepted for permanent residence.Once a permit-holder has been accepted for permanent residence his dependants (if not already here) will be admitted free of conditions to join him at any time;    and the requirement of policeregistration will no longer apply to him and will not apply tothem.d*    Students12.   Students fron overseas will continue to be admitted to followfull-time courses of study at bona fide educational institutions/They will be free to take employment during vacations, but not otherwise;   they will be required to register with the police.e.     Visitors13.   Visitors from overseas will continue to be admitted if theyhave, sufficient means of support for the period of the visit(either from their own resources or from relatives or friends in
this country) and intend to leave at the end of that period.     Ifdoubt over a visitor&apos;s intention makes it appropriate to impose acondition prohibiting employment, a condition requiringregistration with the police will also be imposed;    but in generalvisitors will not be required to register with the police.f.     Refugees14.    Persons with a valid claim to political asylum will continueto be admitted in accordance with the United Kingdom&apos;international obligations.Grounds for refusing admission15.    The grounds for refusing admission to a person coming within one of the categories described above (referred to below as&quot;the passenger&quot;) will be as follows;a. medical grounds (not applicable to returning residents,or the wives or children under 16 of peoplesettled here) jb. conviction for an extradition crime (not applicable toreturning residents, or the wives or children under16 of people settled here);c. security grounds;d. deportation order in force against the passenger;e. admission refused, on the Home Secretary&apos;s instructions on the ground that the passenger&apos;s presence in theUnited Kingdom would not be conducive to the publicgood.f. passenger&apos;s character, conduct or associations such asto make his admission undesirable (not applicableto wives and children under 16 of people settled here);g. passenger not admissible to another country at the endof his stay here (not applicable to returningresidents or the dependants of residents or passengersotherwise admissible as political refugees).Illegal entry16.   A person subject to immigration control who is found in theUnited Kingdom after landing without examination by an immigration officer, in circumstances where such examination is required, willbe liable to be removed as if admission had been refused.     TheBill will create a new offence of being concerned in enablingimmigrants to enter unlawfully, with a maximum penalty of  years&apos; imprisonment.Restrictions on embarkation17. The present requirement that all aliens must obtain leave to embark will be abolished;   but there will be power under the Bill
to impose by Order in Council restrictions on the embarkation ofpersons subject to immigration control for purposes to be specifiedin the Order.Power to impose restrictions after entry18.    The Home Secretary will have power to impose on individuals who are subject to immigration control, and have been alreadyadmitted to the country, special restrictions in regard to placeof residence and reporting to the police if he thinks it necessaryin the public interest to do so.Police registration19.   At present only aliens are required to register with thepolice and the requirement extends to all except:-   (a) thoseadmitted on the normal visit condition and (b) those admitted free of conditions for settlement.     This requirement will remain unchanged, but the normal visit condition will be extended from to 6 months.     The effect of the Bill and the immigration ruleswill be that Commonwealth citizens will have to register:-   (a) ifadmitted with work permits or subsequently allowed to takeapproved employment;    (b) if admitted as students or subsequentlyallowed to stay here to study;    (c) if admitted as au pair girlsor subsequently allowed to stay here in that capacity;    (d) in individual cases where admitted as a visitor but the immigration officer thinks the requirement desirable.     After 4 years inapproved employment the requirement to register will cease if, asis to be expected conditions are then cancelled.Hotel registration20.     The present obligations of hotels to keep registers, and ofpersons staying there to enter their names and other particularsin the register, derive from Article 19 of the Aliens Order 1953.The Bill will empower the Home Secretary to provide by regulations for a similar system of hotel registration.Prosecution of offences21.   In relation to offences which consist in or are connectedwith unlawful entry, or the making of false statements, or thefalsification of documents, the Bill will override the generaltime limit on prosecution of summary offences contained insection 104 of the Magistrates&apos; Courts Act 1952 by providing thatproceedings may be instituted within 2 months of the date onwhich the police obtain evidence justifying the prosecution or within 6 months of the commission of the offence, whicheverperiod expires later, but subject to an overall time limit of3 years.5
DEPORTATIONGrounds for deportation22.   The Bill will empower the Home Secretary to make a 1deportation order againsta. anyone who is subject to immigration control and whofails to comply with the conditions on which hewas admitted;    orb. who is convicted of an offence punishable withimprisonment and is recommended for deportation bythe court;    orc. against whom the Home Secretary deems it conductive to the public good to make a deportation order.Exemption from deportation23.   Ordinary residence for 5 years in the United Kingdom will no longer make a Commonwealth citizen exempt from deportationunless he is granted registration as a citizen of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies.     Registration is not, however, open to persons who are already citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies (e.g. as belonging to a dependent territory) and theBill will provide that such a person may not be deported if hehas been accepted for permanent residence here and, since being so accepted, has been continuously ordinarily resident for atleast 5 years (time spent on conditions will not count towardsthe 5 years).Deportees&apos; wives and children24.    The Home Secretary will have power to include in adeportation order the wife and children of the person against whom the order is made, and any children of hers.     This will cover only dependants who are subject to control.     When adeported dependant ceases to be dependent (e.g. where a childreaches the age of 18, or a wife is divorced from the personagainst whom the order was made) any restrictions on re-entrywill cease to apply to him.
RIGHTS OF APPEAL25.   Persons subject to immigration control will in general have rights ofappeal under the Bill corresponding to those conferred by the immigration appeals Act 1969 and the Aliens (Appeals) Order 1970.   The exceptions areas follows:a. no appeal is to lie against a decision by the Home Secretary(or by an immigration officer or entry certificate or visa officer on the Home Secretary&apos;s instructions) which is taken on the groundthat it is not conducive to the public good for the person concerned to enter or remain in this country;b. no appeal is to lie against a decision taken on the ground thatthe presence of the person concerned is or would be contrary tothe interests of national security;c. when entry is refused to a person who does not hold an entrycertificate, visa or work permit, any right of appeal againstexclusion is to be exercisable only from overseas, after hisremoval, under the same procedure as if he were appealing againstrefusal of an entry certificate or visa.The special appeal procedure for security and political cases will be abolished.REGISTPATION AS CITIZENS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AM) COLONIES26,   Subject to the exception indicated in the next paragraph, the bill will remove the entitlement which a Commonwealth citizen or citizen ofthe Irish Republic now has to be registered as a citizen of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies on completing 5 years&apos; ordinary residence in theUnited Kingdom or 5 years&apos; Crown service under the United KingdomGovernment.   Instead the Secretary of State is to have power as amatter of discretion to register a Commonwealth or Irish citizen whohas the qualifications now required for registration on grounds of residence or Crown service and the following additional qualifications:a. good character;b. sufficient knowledge of the English language;c. the intention, if registered, to reside in the UnitedKingdom or in a dependent territory or to enter or continue inCrown service.The Secretary of State will retain power to register after a periodshorter than 5 years in the special circumstances of a particular case.27o   The Bill will, however, preserve the entitlement to registration of persons who have already settled lawfully in this country by providing for the registration, as of right, of any Commonwealth or Irishcitizen who satisfies the Home Secretary thata. on a date to be fixed by the Bill he was ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom;b. at the time of his application he has been ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for 5 years or more;
c.   he became ordinarily resident here after enteringlawfully (i.e0 he was examined by an immigration officer and was not refused admission, or he entered in circumstances in which it was at the time lawful to enter withoutexamination).
APPENDIX IIIASSISTED REPATRIATIONla     Certain expenditure on people who after admission return totheir own countries is at present incurred without specificstatutory authority.   This expenditure normally consists of thefare, plus perhaps some small incidental expenses.   It isproposed in the Bill to take a general power to cover this kindof expenditure and also to cover the possibility of our having to incur it over a somewhat wider range of cases than hitherto.29     The three main categories of case would bes-(a)   People leaving the United Kingdom under superviseddeparture, in circumstances in which a deportationorder might have been made.   Supervised departure of aliens is arranged in quite a large number of casesat present, normally to spare young foreign nationalsthe stigma of deportation.   Under the proposed legislation there is likely to be scope for someextension of the practice to Commonwealth citizens*(h)   The dependants of a person being deported, not them-selves included in a deportation order.   It is already the practice to pay the fares when wives and childrenwish to leave with the father who is being deported.(c)   People who enter with a work permit and are unable or unwilling to find employment of a type that will he approved, and are prepared to leave the country but cannot pay the fare.   At present foreign nationals inthis position return to their own countries without difficulty.   For Commonwealth citizens entering infuture under the new arrangements for employment,return will not be so easy in view of the longerjourney, and it would be useful to have power to meetthe return fare from public funds.Items under (a) and (b) would be largely a continuation ofexisting expenditure. It is not possible to estimate whatexpenditure under item (c) would be likely to amount to.3.    The power would be drawn in such a way that it could alsobe used, if experience showed a justification, for extending thearrangements under (c) to cover people who were already lawfully-1-
here before the Bill came into operation.   In cases of need the supplementary Benefits Commission are continuing to offerassistance, and officials of the departments concerned are considering how to make this more widely known among the immigrantcommunity.   The possibility of a wider scheme, going beyond need,has been examined by an interdepartmental working group, and itseems clear that on present evidence the practical difficulties and risks of abuse would be out of proportion to any advantage that might be gained.    Ministers will be under pressure on this issue, and may wish to look at it again in the light of experience.They will be able to do so if the Bill contains a provision of thekind described.-2-CONFIDENTIAL
Appendix IVVOTING RIGHTS OF COMMONWEALTH AND IRISH CITIZENSPRESENT position,     All Commonwealth citizens and citizens of the Irish Republic mayvote at parliamentary and local elections in the United. Kingdom if theyare registered as living here on 10 October before the annual registercomes into force (16 February).   Aliens and British Protected Personsmay not vote.2.     At one time 12 months&apos; residence at the address in question was required.    In 1918 this qualifying period was reduced to 6 months.It was reduced again to 3 months in 1926, and dropped altogether in1944 - except in the case of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland for whom it is still 3 months.3.     New Zealand and Barbados give reciprocal voting rights to ourcitizens without qualification.    Australia does so after 6 months1residence; Canada, Jamaica, Trinidad and Guyana do so after 12 months;and Mauritius does so after 2 years.    Other Commonwealth countries and the Republic of Ireland give no such rights for parliamentary elections.4.     Aliens (but not Commonwealth or Irish citizens) are disqualifiedby nationality from membership of the House of Commons, theHouse of Lords and local authorities.THE IMMIGRATION BILL AND VOTING RIGHTS5.     The existing voting rights derive from the British nationalitywhich all Commonwealth citizens have as British subjects, and fromthe Ireland Act 1949 by virtue of which Irish citizens while in theUnited Kingdom have the same rights as British subjects.    The Bill willnot affect the status of Commonwealth citizens as British subjects and will not oblige us to change their voting rights.6.     Since, however, the Bill will exempt from immigration control thosewho belong to the United Kingdom, the first consideration is whether we ought to allow only those who are so exempt to vote.   To do so wouldcertainly be logical; but it would mean denying the vote to United Kingdompassport-holders who do not belong to the United Kingdom, no matterhow long they stayed here; and also to e.g. Australians who live herepermanently but have no wish to renounce Australian citizenship.7.     The next consideration, therefore, is whether citizens of other commonwealth countries, as well as United Kingdom passport-holders who do not belong to the United Kingdom, should have the right to vote whenthey have been accepted for permanent residence.   It might be morerational to extend voting rights only to citizens of those Commonwealth1
countries who now give us reciprocal rights (see paragraph 3 above).There is at first sight a strong case for extending exceptional votingrights to citizens of these countries.    Such rights could be detailedin the Bill, but (in order to avoid having to amend the statute everytime a country changed its rights) the Secretary of State would have tobe empowered to change them by Order.    The scheme would be too complexto explain to all householders on the canvass form, and it would benecessary to arrange for the Commonwealth citizens concerned to applyto their electoral registration officer direct, perhaps on a formobtained from their High Commission.8.     Such a procedure would be undeniably complex.    It is true that itmight not be necessary to explain its refinements to householders, butit would greatly complicate any exposition of voting rights in thiscountry.   Anything as important as the franchise ought desirably to be fairly simple.   Any proposal to allow the franchise to be changed bysubsidiary legislation could attract a good deal of criticism.9.     The countries which give reciprocal rights now are basically theold Commonwealth and those in the Caribbean.    Once we had legislated,other Commonwealth countries (e.g. India and Pakistan) would be tempted to introduce reciprocal voting rights (at minimum electoralcost to themselves) in order to gain more favourable voting rights fortheir citizens here.    These disadvantages seem likely to outweigh the advantages.10.   If on this account we returned to the earlier proposition, weshould give the vote to those exempt from control and also to other commonwealth citizens who had been accepted for permanent residence.But for the Irish there is no procedure parallel to acceptance for permanent residence, and it might therefore be appropriate to give them the vote after 4 years&apos; residence here (though this would be putting them in a third category, and treating them slightly more favourably than other Commonwealth citizens).    Such a formulation ofthe right to vote would be extremely complicated to explain, andimpossible to state at all shortly on the canvass forms which go to20 million householders, very many of whom cannot or do not understand the present simple formula.   The concept of being accepted for permanent residence would be especially difficult to explain.11.   A slightly less complex formula would be to give the vote tothose exempt from control, and also to all other Commonwealth and irish citizens after 4 years&apos; residence.   Even this would not be easily explained, or readily understood   by the public.    exemption from immigration control is a technical term, and would need to be explained as including any citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonieswho has (or is a child or grandchild of someone which has ever had)that citizenship by his birth, adoption, naturalisation, orregistration in the United Kingdom,   As definitions go, this is notto incomprehensible, but a great many householders would not make heador tail of it.   They would have to try to discover who in theirhousehold was exempt from immigration control, and which other commonwealth and Irish citizens had been resident in this country for  years.   In some cases (e,g. where someone had been in and out of2
rffche country for personal or business reasons), this would involve ajudg&amp;ent &apos; on what constitutes residence for electoral purposes,which is a highly esoteric question; the longer the period of residence required, the greater the difficulty.12.    It night be possible to arrange for a certificate to be issuedby the Home Office at the time a man was accepted for permanent residence (which would be prima facie evidence of his having livedhere for 4 years); and some High Commissions night be able to issuecertificates of residence.    Such certificates might make thingseasier for some, but most householders would scarcely understandtheir significance.    It might be possible to arrange for a Commonwealthcitizen to send the certificate direct to the electoral registration officer, but in practice the less well-educated would just not do so.13.    In the case of the Irish, householders would have the purelypractical difficulty of distinguishing between Irish from the republic and people from Northern Ireland.14.    Inevitably a great deal of confusion and misunderstanding wouldresult.   Many qualified people would be left off the canvass returns,and many not qualified would be included.   The published electorslists would reflect these errors and omissions, few of which would be corrected at the claims and objections stage.   Electoral registration officers would have to publish registers which they knew to beinaccurate and, even if inaccuracies resulted only from genuinemisunderstandings, the whole system might fall into disrepute.    Itmight well be brought deliberately into disrepute by disgruntledimmigrants&apos; organisations trying to flood the register withunqualified people.15.    Outside the electoral field there are a number of considerations of some importance.16.   The did Commonwealth countries would see any diminution of the voting rights of Commonwealth citizens here as a further weakening oftheir link with this country.   New Commonwealth countries would nodoubt represent any change as a move to make second-class citizens of their people living here.17.   Any diminution of immigrants&apos; voting rights would tend to damagecommunity relations, particularly in the context of those who havebeen here a year ,or two and would lose a right which many of them havealready exercised.    It would be technically possible to apply the4 year residence qualification only to those who arrived after a givendate, but this would further complicate the law and increase thedifficulties discussed in paragraphs 8-14 at&amp;ove.
18. Any change in the voting rights of citizens of the Irish Republicwould probably require an amendment of the Ireland Act 1949*-19,,   Any legislative provision to change the nationality qualification for membership of the House of Comnons, of the House of Lords, and ofa local authority would provisionally need to include a savingprovision for existing members.w
