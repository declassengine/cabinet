S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(70) 1024 November 1970CABINETINTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION: conventions and RECOMMENDATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for employment, The constitution of the International Labour Organisation imposeson us an obligation to bring International Labour Conventions andRecommendations before Parliament as soon as possible after their adoption by the Organisation0    This is traditionally done by a white paper which also sets out the Governments attitude to the instrumentsin question.    I now enclose a draft White Paper dealing with ConventionsNos 129 and 130 and Recommendations Nos 133 and 134 which were adoptedby the International Labour Conference in June 1969.    The draft has beenprepared in full consultation between my Department and others concerned.2.        As my colleagues will see from the opening paragraph the texts ofthe instruments are to be set out in the Annex to the White Paper,    As the texts are somewhat lengthy I am not circulating them with this paper butthey are available to any of my colleagues who wish to see them,3.        Convention No 129 and Recommendation No 133 are designed to influence the conditions of agricultural workers by means of a systemof labour inspection and law enforcement.    The Recommendation is acceptable but the Convention concerns provisions that preclude ourratification of it.4,        Convention No 130 and Recommendation No 134 deal with medical care and sickness benefits.    Although they are based on principles whichare acceptable to us, ratification of the Convention is not practicable solong as the future development of our social security schemes is underconsideration,5,        If my colleagues agree I propose to publish the enclosed draft assoon as possible,    I should be grateful for any comments not later thanWednesday 11 November,    I do not expect the document to prove in anyway controversial,R department of Employment SW13 November 1970COPY NO   5 g
DRAFT V/HITE PAPERIN1&apos;ERNA&apos;X&apos;I0NAL LABOUR conference the decisions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government on two Conventions and two recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference at its53rd Session in 19&amp;9 are set out below.   The texts of the instruments are setout in the annex to this paper.CONVENTION NO 129 AND RECOMMENDATION NO 133 CONCERNING LABOUR INSPECTION INAGRICULTUREThe Convention is designed to improve the conditions of agricultural workersby requiring ratifying countries to maintain a system of labour inspection tosecure enforcement of the legal provisions relating to conditions of work and protection of workers in agriculture.,   It determines the functions of the system,the nature of the undertakings to be covered, and the categories of workers to be protected.The Convention requires that, where compatible with administrative practice,the system shall be controlled by a central authority, and shall provide for:co-operation with other services, both public and private; collaboration with employers and workers or their organisations;    recruitment of qualified staff insufficient numbers;    furnishing of facilities appropriate to the needs of the inspection services;   regular and thorough inspection of undertakings;   and publication of annual reports and statistics on the activities of the inspectionservices.Other essential elements are concerned with the role of the labour inspectorand the powers that should be corrfV:::od upon him to carry out his functions.The Convention also provides for adequate penalties to be imposed for violation of the legal provisions enforceable by labour inspectors or for obstructinginspectors in the course of their duties.The Convention provides for the granting of powers of enforcement and of discretion in their exercise which are not possessed by agricultural labourinspectors under existing law in the United Kingdom.   For this reason theGovernment do not propose to ratify the Convention.
The Recommendation is supplementary to the Convention.   In addition tothe functions specified therein it recommends that labour inspectorates:should collaborate with the competent technical services with a view tohelping the agricultural producer to improve his holding and theconditions of life and work of those working on it;might be associated with the enforcement of legal provisions on suchmatters as training of workers, social services in agriculture,co-operatives and compulsory school attendance;    andshould be consulted before the introduction of new plant, materialsor methods which might endanger health or safety.It recommends further that labour inspectors in agriculture ahould not undertake conciliation or arbitration in proceedings concerninglabour disputes;   andshould limit their activity during the night to those matters whichcannot be controlled during the day.It indicates additional statistical and other information that might beincluded in annual reports and advocates educational- campaigns on the subjectof the content and importance of the law as well as of consideration of health and safety as applicable to agricultural undertakings.The Government propose to accept this Recommendation.CONVENTION NO 130 AND RECOMMENDATION NO 134 CONCERNING MEDICAL CARE and sickness benefits the Convention is concerned with the provision of cash benefits and medical care during sickness, and lays down minimum standards regarding coverage, range,and quality of provision.   It revises earlier Conventions which no longer reflect the practice in countries where there is a reasonably high standard of provisionfor sick members of the community.The general aim of the Convention is to guarantee to as many people aspossible medical care in all its aspects, and a reasonable minimum standard ofliving when normal earnings are interrupted by sickness.   The Convention sets out the requirements in some considerable detail, while providing a certaindegree of flexibility in general standards for countries where economic2
development is still very limited.   It also provides for temporary derogationswhere a country&apos;s general standards of provisions are higher than the minimumbut fail to meet some detailed requiremBnts of the Convention.In terms of medical care the Convention recognises that preventive, curativeand rehabilitative measures are closely inter-related and that an adequate systemmust include all three.    It provides that medical care should cover at theleast either all employed persons, or 75fo of the economically active population,together in each case with their wives and children, or 75/6 of all residents,for general practitioner, specialist, and hospital care;    medicines, etc;    dentalcare;   and the various aspects of medical rehabilitation.   Recognition is givento the fact that in nearly all countries some direct charge is made to theconsumer for certain medical services, but provision is made to ensure thatsuch charges do not deprive people, because of financial difficulties, of medical services they need.In terms of cash benefits, the objective is similarly coverage of at theleast all employed persons, and at a level which will give a man with a wife andtwo children who becomes incapable of work not less than 6Cfo of his previousearnings, subject to a ceiling, for the. first year of incapacity.   There aredetailed provisions regarding, for example, waiting periods, and suspension ofbenefit in certain circumstances.   There is also an Article prescribing paymentof a funeral benefit. .  The Reconaendation which accompanies the Convention invites those countrieswhich comply with the requirements of the Convention to extend the coverage and improve the standards of their provisions.It recommends, for example, medical care for as long as it is required forall those ordinarily resident in the country;   and appropriate services forconvalescents.   It also concerns itself with the problems of working people whohave sick relatives to look after, or who have to take time off during normal working hours to obtain medical treatment.As regards each benefits, it recommends extension of coverage to all workers and that benefit should be paid to certain people who are not on a narrowdefinition incapable of work - such as people in quarantine.   The Recommendationsuggests that benefit should be of indefinite duration and set at 6G2/3a/o insteadof 60yo of previous earnings.3
COM... ,iTALThe Government accept the principles embodied in the Convention and recommendation, and welcome the attempt to embody in international instrumentsrealistic modern standards.The shape and content of the Convention and Recommendation have to asubstantial extent been dictated by the practice of those national schemes which link medical care and cash benefits in a common insurance system.   Inthe United Kingdom, those provisions are quite separate;    and the limitations on duration, scope, and coverage of medical care recognised in the instrumentsare alien to the United Kingdom&apos;s comprehensive National Health Service.    Ourhealth provisions generally more than satisfy the requirements of bothConvention and Recommendation.   Existing and United Kingdom provisions on cash benefits also are in general in line with both the Convention and theRecommendation.   The Government must, however, reserve their position regardingratification because the future development of the United Kingdom social security schemes is under consideration.   It is the Government&apos;s view thatratification should be considered in the light of the new arrangements whichemerge rather than of the current arrangements which are being reconsidered.DEPARTMENT OE EMPLOYMENTsva3 November 19704
