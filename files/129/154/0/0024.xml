&amp;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 124 COPY NO31 December 1970CABINETIMPROVED EXPENDITURE DECISIONS BY government memorandum by the Lord Privy SealWhen the Cabinet considered my earlier memorandum on thissubject (CP(70) 101) enclosing a report by the business team, I was invited to report further on the ways in which a system of programme analysis and review (PAR) might be introduced and operated.2.      It has been possible to make considerable progress in meetingthe cabinet&apos;s requirements tor further information, making use of the steering Committee on Public Expenditure.    Through this Committeeagreement has been reached between the Treasury, Civil service department,, Cabinet Office and Permanent Secretaries of a number of major spending Dejsartments oil a statement of what the PAR system will mean to Departments i the attached report, which has the agreement of departments generally,, summarises the maia points.    In particular,there has been a useful clarification of the way in which selectivity willbe exercised in choosing areas for programme reviews (paragraphs 11-13of the Annex), and further work has been done on the timetable of PARand its relationship to PESC (paragraph 25).3,      The manpower implications, which are naturally of particularconcern to me and which attracted the cabinet&apos;s attention at the last discussion, are referred to in paragraph 28 of the report.    although we must be vigilantly on guard against new policy undertakings whichwould hinder the attainment of the objectives that Cabinet has justadopted on the size of the nor.-industrial civil service in 1971-72, Iconsider that the estimated additional requirement of fewer than 100 staffby 1 April 1972 is an acceptable price to pay for the PAR system.    Weshould of course look again later at the manpower implications beyond1972 in the course of settling the development of subsequent stages of thesystem.    The key appointment in each Department (though not necessarilyone that would call for a new post) is that of PAR co-coordinator, who mustbe an official of the right quality and status j and I attach particular importance to this.1f1
4,     The Chancellor of the Exchequer has authorised me to say that he fully supports the proposals for the introduction and operation of PARthat are put forward in the attached report.5.     The Cabinet at their last discussion expressed general agreementwith the aims of PAR.     The work that has since been done by officialsas summarised in the attached report makes it clear 0 in my view, that apractical basis can be devised for its introduction in 1971 in the mainspending Departments.    I therefore ask the Cabinet:^(i)to agree that a   system of programme analysis and review should be introduced as outlined in the attached report, which follows and develops the report of thebusiness team annexed to my earlier memorandum(CP(70) 101)5(ii)to authorj.se the Civil Service Department, the treasury and the Cabinet Office (on behalf of tho Central policy review Staff) to enter into the necessary discussions with departments to pj.t it into effect.Civil. Service Department, SWl31 December 1970i i2P
INTRODUCTION OF A PROGRAMME ANALYSISAND REVIEW SYSTEMReport by the Steering Committee on PublicExpenditure1.     On 17 November the Cabinet discussed the proposal for a programme analysis and review (PAR) system in the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s paper CP(70)101, following the submission of the Business Teara&apos;sreport.     Their conclusion was recorded as follows -The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said thatthere was general agreement with the aims of a PAR system;but the implications of introducing it, particularly interms of its demands on manpower, should be worked out in greater detail.     As the next step, further discussions shouldtake place between the Civil Service Department, the Treasury,the Cabinet Office and the Departments concerned;    and theLord Privy Seal should report further to the Cabinet when amore detailed scheme had been elaborated.The Cabinet -1.     Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,2.     Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for theCivil Service Department, in consultation with theTreasury, the Cabinet Office and other Departments,to make recommendations on the ways in which a PARsystem might be introduced and operated;    and toreport again in due course to the Cabinet.2. Accordingly, Permanent Secretaries have prepared the following report in the Steering Committee on Public Expenditure covering:-(i)    the form which a detailed programme review scheme might take and the way in which it might be operated(ii)   the implications of introducing it, especially interms of demands on manpower.(i) is dealt with in Part A of this report and takes the form ofan outline of the working of a system, which would be converted intooperating instructions to Departments.   These would be subject to review in the light of experience.    Part B deals with (ii) above,and takes account of returns made to the CSD by Departments in thelight of the draft instructions for a scheme.   Following the cabinet discussion stress is placed on the selective character of thescheme (see paragraph 13 below).1
PART a working of a Programme Analysis and Review (PAR) System3. The main features of programme reviews covered below are:the type of area to be covered; selection of areas and policy options for review; the relationship of reviews to the public expenditure Surveys; their information base; and the nature andtimetable of discussions with the central departments on theirpreparation.h.     The main object of PAR would be progressively to improve the analysis of public expenditure projects and programmes so as toprovide Ministers, both individually and collectively, with a betterbasis for determining the balance of expenditure within the total andfor relating the objectives of programmes to Government strategy.This would require closer consideration of the objectives of the programmes, more attention to the returns obtained from them and tothe relationship of those returns to expenditure, and moresystematic examination of alternative ways of achieving the desiredobjectives.     The aim would be to use in each programme whatevertechniques offered the best prospect of improvement in these directicrisin the circumstances of that programme.Interdepartmental machinery5-     A committee chaired by the Head of the Civil Service would beavailable to take a broad view of plans and progress for theintroduction of PAR and to deal with organisational, staff andtraining aspects.     The Steering Committee on Public Expenditure,under Treasury chairmanship, would be the main instrument for co-ordinating the concepts and procedures of the PAR system.     TheCentral Policy Review Staff would be represented on both Committees.Mr R East, a member of the Business Team in Government based on theCSD, would be appointed Director of the PAR project.     He would serve on both Committees, would report to Sir William Armstrong andwould work with the central Departments (Treasury, CSD and central policy Review Staff) and other Departments on the introduction ofthe system.6.     Programme review documents would be fully discussed with theTreasury in the first instance, and it is expected that the central policy Review Staff and as necessary the CSD would join these discussions.     The Central Policy Review Staff would provide staffsupport to Ministers collectively when programme reviews were considered at the Cabinet Committee stage.     The Cabinet Committeewould be the one concerned with the appropriate area of government policy (social Services, overseas policy etc).Range and Scope of Programme Reviews7.     The field for programme reviews would be those policies and programmes with a significant public expenditure content.8.     The intention would be to identify areas for programme reviewswhich constitute, or ought to constitute, an appropriate unit forpolicy options;   which represent a major sector of a Department&apos;s2
responsibilities, or a major sector divided between Departments;and which constitute a significant total of public expenditure(normally tens of  m. as a minimum).     Programme reviews would bedirected mainly at &quot;departmental programmes&quot;, or areas of corresponding importance, rather than at relatively minor functionsor limited facets of policy.9*     As a minimum, programme reviews would cover the 5 year periodof the Public Expenditure Survey.     They ought to cover a longer period ahead wherever the issues raised by the programme made thisappropriate.10.   A programme review would be prepared in a form which suitedthe needs of the particular programme, and was most apt-as a basis for decisions by Ministers.     All reviews would however contain3 main elements -i. a review of the current situation and environment ofthe programme (eg statement of existing PESC allocations;summary of the strengths and weaknesses of the programme;influence of developing demographic or technological factors and critical dates for major decisions).ii. consideration of the objectives of the programme and of thescope and case for changes of policy (including examination ofoptions for change of policy with their effects on expenditure andon the &quot;outputs&quot; of the programme;   of the scope for improving management through major organisational change,where appropriate;   and of action needed to implement change).iii. conclusions and recommendations, including proposalsfor future studies in depth.Selection of Areas for Programme Reviews11.   A first group of programme reviews would be completed by october 1971.     Departments would survey their whole field inconsultation with the central Departments in order to decide whichprogrammes or parts of programmes, and which options within them would merit early analysis.     The selection of areas for reviewwould take account of special studies or policy reviews already inprogress, so as to avoid duplication.     Selection would also take account of critical dates for major decisions in any part of theDepartment&apos;s field (paragraph 10(i) above);    of whether a particular area had been reviewed in the recent past;    and of the knowndirection of Government policy.12.   Some areas might be identified requiring study in depth over aperiod extending beyond October of the relevant year.   These studiesmight form the basis for programme reviews in the following year.13,   Subject to paragraph 11 above, each main spending Departmentmight review one or perhaps two important programmes in 1971,and very large Departments might review one or two main programmes from each of their policy areas.      There wouldbe similar decisions to concentrate on particular areas in subsequent years and the aim might be to ensure that all areas3
likely to gain from programme review were subjected to fullanalysis over a period.     This approach would allow Departmentsconsiderable managerial flexibility on the staff and organisationrequired for PAR.     It is envisaged that the numbers of extra staffneeded to prepare programme reviews in 1971 would be small:    andin making the choice of areas for special attention it would benecessary to have regard to the staff that could be made availablefor the work.     Any future expansion would have to be justified onits merits.1h.   Ministers might wish in appropriate cases (especially wherethey were preparing several programme reviews in the same year) topreface their review documents with a statement on broad prioritiesbetween programmes for which they were responsible.Relationship with Public Expenditure Surveys15.   Programme reviews would be drawn up within the framework ofthe latest available PESC decisions by Ministers.     If increases in expenditure were proposed, broadly matching reductions would alsobe suggested wherever possible, either in the same programme or in another programme for which the same Minister had responsibility.The reviews would make clear what would be the expected costs and benefits from such increases and reductions, including costs and benefits of a political character.16,   Analysis in programme reviews, and guidance given by ministers on priorities in the light of the reviews, would bear closely on proposals put forward and decisions taken in Public ExpenditureSurveys:    though in many cases the effect would be on Surveys in later years.Determinants of Expenditure17.   Departments would be asked to make clear in their programmereviews what were the determinants of public expenditure in their programmes (eg demographic factors, movements of population,obsolescence of buildings, crime and detection rates etc), and howfar these were susceptible to policy.Objectives and Outputs18.   Programme reviews would contain sections on the objectivesrelevant to departmental programmes and Departments would be askedto consider how far these objectives could be usefully defined orredefined.     In defining objectives in a form relevant to improvedexpenditure decisions, the need would often be to avoid &quot;objectives&quot;of a very general kind (eg &quot;the national interest&quot; or &quot;greaterconsumer satisfaction&quot;), and also to avoid those which would confusemeans with ends (eg &quot;to build more roads or houses, or pay more in benefits&quot;).     Objectives would need to be specific, but concernedwith ends rather than means (eg to reduce the number of peopleinadequately housed).k
19*   Departments would need to consider what were the &quot;outputs&quot; oftheir programmes.     &quot;Outputs&quot; might range from those which describedultimate achievement (eg numbers of people housed adequately or reduced congestion on main roads):   through intermediate outputs(eg numbers of houses constructed, or miles of road built);    to cases where it might be possible only to make a broad qualitativeassessment of achievement or to have regard to limited indicators.Obviously the measurement of outputs would present difficulties ina number of cases.Options20.   The number of possible options for the adjustment of programmes,especially major programmes, would often be large.     departments would need to decide in consultation with the central departments which options were worthy of full analysis, taking account of theknown direction of Government policies.     The likely effects of the selected options in both public expenditure and output terms shouldbe brought out.Discussion with the Treasury and other Central Departments21.   At the first stage Departments would discuss the scope and form of their programme reviews with the central Departments.These discussions would cover inter alia -i. the division of the Department&apos;s field into areasappropriate for separate reviews (departmental programmes)and the selection of programmes for early review.ii. the determination of the main sub-divisions of selectedprogrammes, and the initial selection of policy options for detailed analysis.   The selection of options may need to be reviewed as analysis proceeds.   -iii. what information was needed and could be obtained insupport of each programme review in that year.iv. the relationship to programme reviews of any specialstudies bearing on them already in progress.22.   Thereafter Departments would proceed with the preparation oftheir programme reviews.     A complete draft would then be submittedto the Treasury, with copies to the other central Departments, forfurther discussion.     These submissions would reach the Treasury bysay end July and in their final form would take account of ministerial decisions on the Public Expenditure Survey Report takenin the period July to October.23.   Public expenditure decisions would continue to be taken underthe Public Expenditure Survey system against the background ofpublic expenditure as a whole, of available resources, and the Govern-mente major economic policy.     For this purpose, surveys ofpublic expenditure as a whole, compiled interdepartmentally,are essential.   It is not envisaged that programme reviewswould be brought together by an interdepartmental committeeof officials into a single report concerned with the aggregate5
of public expenditure, as happens in the Public expenditure survey Committee, but the Central Policy Review Staffmight ultimately co-ordinate material from programme reviews aspart of its task: of helping Ministers to define their long termstrategy and to make decisions in pursuit of that strategy.2h.    Ministers would put forward programme reviews to theappropriate Cabinet Committee in October/November, after having&quot;before them a report on the outcome of discussions with the central departments.     Programme reviews would include a reference to the outcome of these discussions and Treasury or CSD Ministers might on occasion wish to submit a separate paper to the Cabinet Committee.Possible Timetable for 197125.    If a Cabinet decision were made at a sufficiently early date,the timetable for programme reviews in 1971 might be on thefollowing lines.     There would he room for flexibility about the timing of successive stages, provided a completed version wereavailable by October 1971:January/March 1 971February/July 1971June/October 1971July/October 1971October/November 1971Nove mb er/Feb r uary1971        1972Discussions between Departments and central Departments on the selection and scope of 1971 programme reviews.Departments to produce draft reviewsfor selected programmes and make themavailable to the Central Deparcmentsby say end July 1971 *Departments to discuss draft programmereviews with the central departments and establish whether any differences of view existed on priorities forpolicy changes or development, or onareas requiring further study etc.Departments to amend programmereviews in the light of ministerial decisions on the 1971 PESC Report.Ministers would submit programmereviews to Cabinet Committees.Ministers would consider the programmereviews collectively, with theassistance of the Central policy review Staff, and rule on therecommendations.   These ministerial decisions could be taken into account,as appropriate, in the 1972 PESCsubmissions due in February 1972, andin work on PAR in 1972.
Conclusions and Recommendations26* Conclusions and recommendations in programme reviews would bedirected to -a. the general direction of policy and the priorities forchange or development.ib. areas requiring further major study, departmentally orinterdepartmentally.c. the prospective timing of major decisions and of the implementation of them, and the relationship between thi3timetable and decisions on successive Public ExpenditureSurveys.PART BManpower etc implications of introducing a PAR system27. Reference was made in the Cabinet discussion on 17 november to the extra burden on Ministers likely to result from programmereviews. It is likely that Ministers would be involved cheifly the selection of areas for review, and in the approval of thefinal review document and its subsequent discussion in CabinetCommittee (paragraph 25 above). Some of this activity would nodoubt be in substitution for ad hoc reviews or references to cabinet committees which would have taken place in any event: a fieldlikely to call for a collective decision from Ministers before long would be a natural one for selection for programme review.28.   Given the intended degree of managerial flexibility in the approach, and the limitation on the number of programmes to be covered in PAR in the first year or two, the number of staff required would be small, as noted in paragraph 13 above.Departments have been invited to assess in a preliminary way,recognising that precision is impossible at this stage, what their additional requirements might be.   The estimates receivedfrom 15 departments in response to this approach indicate atotal requirement for PAR purposes, additional to staff numbersalready submitted for 1971-72, of fewer than 100 staff by1 April 1972.   Estimates beyond that date must be very speculative;,but the replies do not indicate any present expectation of a very rapid build-up thereafter.
