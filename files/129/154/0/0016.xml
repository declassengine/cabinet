DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJE5TYTS GOVERNMENT59CP(70) 116 COPY no. 8 December 1970CABINETLCCniEED/ROLLS ROYCE TRISTAR: EXPORT credits guarantee DEPARTMENT COVER FORSUBORDINATED DEBTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and IndustryBACKGROUND1,        The future of Rolls Royce hinges critically on the sales of theLocMieed TriStar aircraft, which is the only application so far secured forthe RB 211-22 engine.    We recently decided to increase our launching aid for this engine to a total of  89 million.2,        The TriStar is competing against the Douglas DC 10 aircraft,powered by the General Electric company is CF 6 engine    Sales of, andoptions for, the DC 10 have overtaken those of the TriStar.    One importantreason underlying this has been the financial strength of General Electric,which has enabled them to offer very favourable financing deals for theDC 10.    There is little doubt that General Electric are using their vastresources to break into the civil aero engine field, and to destroy the lockheed/Rolls Royce competition.3.        Lockheed have asked for further United Kingdom Government help for Rolls Royce, specifically to counter General Electric creditcompetition.    This usually takes the form of long-term lending for the totalcost of the CF 5 engines, coupled with short term finance to enable buyersto make down-payments for airframes.    For sales within the USA, GeneralElectric are also prepared to allow their long-term lending to be on asubordinated basis, and this creates the present problem for us.4.        The broad effect of subordinated lending is that, in the event ofinsolvency or default, the subordinated creditors would stand out of their money until the senior debt holders had been paid in full.    V/hile insolvencyof a major American airline is unli2tely9 there must be a real possibilityof a forced merger, which could result in protracted delays in the paymentof subordinated creditors.1
5.        The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) have already-agreed to guarantee lending for 90 per cent of the value of engines for theTriStar on ten year terms from delivery (on a non-subordinated basis).59 aircraft have been sold to American airlines on these terms, Including25 to Eastern Airlines.    All the contracts contained options for furtheraircraft.THE PROBLEM6.        Eastern Airlines have to decide whether or not to confirm theiroption for a further 25 TriStars0    Their own financial position and theircommitments to unsubordinated creditors prevent them from carrying out their replacement programme unless they can raise additional subordinatedcapital.    They are therefore pressing Lockheed/Rolls Royce to providesubordinated capital for their new buying,,    Lockheed*s own financialoituation is too weak to support such lending and they are thereforepressing Rolls Royce to provide the kind of subordinated finance forengines that General Electric are offering for theirs.7.        ECGD could not recommend supporting such subordinated debt asa &quot;commercial&quot; risk under section 1 of the Export Guarantee Act 19C5.The security is manifestly second class.8.        The question is whether ECGD, with Treasury consent, shouldguarantee lending with a degree of subordination &quot;In the national interest&quot;under section 2 of that Act.THE ARGUMENTS9.        The case for giving the guarantee rests on the need to sustain the rolls Royce RB 211 engine in competition against General Electric, and to recover the Governments launching aid of  89 million.    The problemconsequently is not confined to the sale to Eastern Airlines.    Subordinationwill probably be a factor in other contracts.    If sales of the TriStar are toreach the level needed to recoup our investment In the RB 211, further orders from American airlines will probably be needed for some 100 aircraft,.This could result in total demands for about  100 million of subordinatedcredit, including  26 million for the Eastern Airlines deal.    This is avery large sum for ECGD to have at risk on such a hazardous basis.CONCLUSION10.       On 7 December, I discussed this issue with my colleagues in the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy.    We agreed that ECGD mightbe authorised to guarantee lending to Eastern Airlines on a subordinatedbasis, subject to the following provisos?2
i. Eastern should lease aircraft to the maximum possible extent (this would give us specific security of a share in theleased aircraft proportionate to our financing of the engines).ii0        The aim should be to negotiate a degree of security thatwould place us at the head of the queue of subordinated creditors,and in any case we should not accept a degree of subordinationlower than that of  he convertible debenture holders.    (This would place us above Boeings and Douglas, who have lent Easternrelatively small amounts on a subordinated basis).iii. Not more than half fche value of the total sales guaranteed by ECGD, including the first buy, should be thus subordinated.(Allowing a minimum of  10 million for leased aircraft, theamount of subordinated finance would not exceed  24 million).iv. The balance of sales guaranteed by ECGD would be securedpari pass a with non subordinated creditors.v. Rights of recourse would be retained against Rolls Roycefor all claims paid by EGGD as a result of default on subordinateddebt0    (This seems reasonable since what we would be doing is toenable Rolls Royce to compete with General ElectricTc privatecredit competition.)11.        In view of the close connection between ihis proposal and theCabinet*s recent decision on launching aid for the RB 211-22 engine however,the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy invited me to report theposition to Cabinet before any act ion was taken.    I hope that they will agreeto ECGD proceeding on the basis set out in paragraph 10 above.J d department of Trade and Industry SW18 December 19703
