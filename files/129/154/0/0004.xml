DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(70) 104 COPY NO     rQ10 November 1970CABINETRATE SUPPORT GRANT AND MANUAL WORKERS^PAY settlement memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. When the Cabinet, on 3 November (CM(70) 35th Conclusions,Minute 4) approved the basis for the negotiation of rate support grant for1971-72 and 1972-73 I was invited to consult the Chancellor and the Secretaryof State for Employment about the attitude the Government should adoptabout the implications for rate support grant of Sir Jack Scampi inquiry into the dispute on the pay of manual workers.   However, now that it hasbeen settled on the basis of the &quot;Scamp Report&quot; I have been asked to bringthe question before Cabinet again,2.        It is important to place the actions of the local authority employers in the dispute in perspective.    In the first place, their negotiations werebegun against the background of a 15 per cent increase awarded to theGovernments own manual workers from 1 July 1970.    At the height of thelocal government strike when the employers were considering their offer of 21 October it was announced that agricultural workers had been awardedan increase of IS per cent and some grades in the British steel corporation were reported as getting increases of 18! per cent.    TheGovernment did not intervene in these cases.    At the same time theNational Coal Board made an offer to mine workers which, although it was12 per cent overall, involved increases of as much as 20 per cent at the bottom end of the scale.    Furthermore, the Government did notdenounce the local government offers made after the one of 3 September(of about 14 per cent).3.        It should also be recalled that of 1,600 local authorities only 30 or so made individual settlements and all but a few of the rest remained firmlyin support of their national negotiators.    It is easy to underestimate the pressures upon them to settle - they had virtually no public support andwere indeed being criticised for allowing pollution to occur.1
4.        In fche Annex Is a summary of the Scamp award compared with theemployers1 offer of 3 September.    The relative costs with and withoutgrant are also set out.    The grant payable in a year on the differencebetween the Scamp award and the employers&apos;&apos; earlier offer would be about 8 million.5,        Before the rate support grant order is made the negotiated figures,arrived at within the limits approved by the Cabinet on 3 November, willbe increased to take account of increases in pay and prices which have occurred since 30 June 1970 (all fche figures for the negotiations are interms of prices at that date).    I would be able to reduce the amount addedin this way, to exclude grant on the excess of Scamp over the earlier offer.I have no power, however, to exclude from the increase order for 1970-71the extra amount payable as a result of the Scamp settlement for theremaining 4f months of the year following 9 November when the new ratesstart.6.        Although I could thus withhold grant for the next two years I do notthink that I ought to do so for the following reasons -a. The local authorities can reasonably complain that, if we wished to impose limits, we should have given specific warningseither at the beginning of the negotiations, or at the time whenarbitrators were appointed, that no matter what the outcome, theamount to be recognised for grant would be fixed.    We did not do this.b. Withholding grant could hardly be justified if the Governmentmatch the Scamp offer for the ancillary staff of the National health service.c. The strike is settled and action now cannot influence thedecision.    The demonstration - and it would be little more thanthat because the effect would be small beside the extra^burden onthe rates which arises even from fche employers1 offer - would therefore make the Government appear petty and spiteful.d. It would seem best to play down the importance of theScamp report.    The flurry of Press comment is over.    to withhold grant now would stir it up again.7.        If we intend to try to influence the level of pay awards in localgovernment we shall need to be specific.    We must have an overt incomes policy for the public sector and make known in advance the amount of increases that v/e are prepared to accept.    We could then properly suppor tsuch a policy by withholding g^ant, but to.,make this credible we would need to legislate to take power to exclude excess awards from increase orders.It is, however, by no means sure that even the certainty that grant would2
be withheld would affect the settlement reached in circumstances such asthose surrounding the manual workers^ dispute.    Moreover, it would be inconsistent to legislate for the purpose of a specific income?: policy for local government when we are avoiding imposing such a specific policy onall other types of employment,8.        Local government already faces a rise in rates next year of at leastIs 2d and possibly Is 6d or even more.    To withhold grant on the extraamount of the Scamp award would increase the Is 6d to Is 7d.    As apunishment this would not be effective.    On the contrary, withholdinggrant would enable local government to blame much of the increase in rates on the meanness of central Government and thus evade theresponsibility which otherwise rests squarely on them.9.        I therefore invite the Cabinet to agree that the rate support grantsettlement should take full account of the manual workers1 pay settlement.P w department of the Environment SW!10 November 1970
(confidential) I- - ANNEXLOCAL AUTHORITY MANUAL WORKERS&apos; PAYUnions&apos; claim the Unions&apos; claim was for an increase of 55s. in basic ratesplus items which would, in total, have added  90 million to theannual wage hill, and would have produced increases in earningsjaveraging about 20$.Employers&apos; Offer of 3rd september the employers&apos; offer was for an increase of 36s. in basic ratesfor full-time male workers, an increase of 3s. in the servicesupplement, increases in shift work allowances, and in holiday-entitlements, plus a guaranteed minimum earnings level of  16 10s.Women workers would have received increases at 90$ of those awardedto male workers.     This offer would have added  63 million to theannual wage hill and would have provided average increases in earnings of about 14$.Scamp proposals the settlement recommended by the Scamp report was for anincrease of 50s. in basic rate for male workers plus increases inshift work allowances and holiday entitlement.     Women will receiveincreases of 85$ of those given to male workers.     This will add an estimated  81 million to the annual wage bill and will provideincreases in earnings averaging about 17.5$   (this compares with thefigure used in the Scamp report of about 15i$ which related to theestimated  72 million for the 12 months beginning 29th September 1970).Effect on Rate Support grant the full year effect of the manual workers1 various claims,offers and award, which applies to Great Britain is as follows:-1.confidential)
(confidential)(a) Claim(b) Scamp award(c) 3rd September offer 90 million19.35$ 81 million17.3* 63 million13.5*The expenditure towards which rate support grant would he paid inEngland and Wales is less than this by roughly 10* in order to exclude Scotland and by a further 10* because expenditure on housing and trading services, both of which employ manual workers, is not relevant for rate support grant.     The rate support grant expenditureequivalent for England and Wales is therefore estimated as follows:-The extra relevant expenditure is thus  14.5 million and the grant payable on it at 574* would be  8 million.The cost of the award on the rates without any grant at allwould he about 8d. in England and Wales.     The cost with grant willbe about 4d;   the rate poundage equivalent of the difference betweenthe offer and the award is roughly lid. and the effect of withholdinggrant on this difference would he slightly under a 1d. rate.Scamp award 65.5 million3rd September offer     51million2.
