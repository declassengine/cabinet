gjCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(70) 11226 November 1970:opy no51CABINETAIRBUSESMemorandum by the Minister of Aviation Supply1.        At its meeting on 3 November the Cabinet decided to put certain questions to the French, German and Netherlands Governments to establishmore clearly the basis on wnich the Rolls Royce RB2U-61 engine might beadopted for the A300B European airbus.    The answers (copy at Annex I)have been fully discussed with officials of the other Governments.    they give us no assurance either that the European national airlines would buy(or even be pressed by Governments to buy) the aircraft with R.nicholls royce engines, or that other Governments would contribute to engine launchingcosts.2.        The v/ay is now clear for consideration of the various options opento us.    This paper summarises them briefly.    The cost and out-turn foreach are set out at Annex II; the figures are necessarily tentative, but Ibelieve they are a sufficiently reliable guide for a comparative judgmentabout the courses available.RE-ENTRY INTO A300B WITH RB211-61 ENGINES3.        The R.B211-51 would be too late for the present A3003-1, and would therefore be launched in the stretched version of the aircraft, the A300B-7.The engine launching cost tc Her MajestyTs Government Is unlikely to beless than, say,  75 million when allowance is made for the fact that extraengine development would probably be required to match the needs of theA300B-7.    In the absence of a firm German undertaking to contribute,nothing has been assumed.4.        The engine would be in direct competition with the General Electric(GE) CF 6, which would already have been firmly established in the aircraft,and it would have no assured market.    British European Airways (EEA)would,understandably, be unwilling to use the A300B-7 with Rolls R.oyce enginesunless some other major airlines use the same power plant.1
5.        Neither Rolls Royce nor v/e believe that, in these circumstances,the A300B represents an adequate launching base for the engine? therewould be a serious risk of worsening Rolls Royce&apos;s financial situation.Our view might change if Lockheed also placed an order, but this ?.p most unlikely before the middle of 1971.5.        My conclusion is that we should not launch the engine for the A300B.I am satisfied that the other Governments would understand and accept our reasons.RE-ENTRY INTO THE A300B (WITH GE ENGINES)7.        This means taking up the current proposal by the european governments that we should re-enter as full partners, with an equal shareof the rights and responsibilities.    The launching cost of the A300B is given as  175 million at 1968 prices (on a fixed price contract with an escalationclause), plus the cost of launching the larger A300B-7, whose launchingcost has not yet been established, but is expected to be some  20 million.Our estimates of sales lie between 175 and 275 aircraft,8.        The United Kingdom share of this would be some 27 per cent or 52 million at 19S8 prices, but the Germans and Hawker Siddeley arealready bearing  30 million of this and will continue to do so.    Theremainder would fall as a direct cost to Her Majesty^ Government.    Withan allowance for contingencies, the amount is likely to be at least 30 million (at current prices).    On the basis proposed by the otherGovernments, Her Majestyts Governments recovery would be nil at175 sales and  10 million at 275 sales.    There would be no unilateral rightof withdrawal,9.        There are certain conditions of re-entry which involve furthercontingent liabilities beyond the  30 million and whose impact v/e cannotestimate in advance.    Firstly, we are asked to indemnify Hawker Siddeleyagainst loss in respect of that part of the United Kingdom share which theyare financing (about  13 million).    A similar suggestion that v/e shouldindemnify the Germans should be negotiable.    Secondly, we should beexpected to share responsibility for risks of loss if aircraft are unsold or have to be sold at a subsidised price.    While we should try to limit ourliabilities in negotiation, the others will argue that we should share the liabilities as equal partners.    Losses under these arrangements mightwipe out or exceed our recoveries, by an amount which is impossible tcquantify at this stage, leaving us with a final cost in excess of our original 30 million contribution as the price of our ticket of entry to the project.10.       The United Kingdom share of the airframe production work, mainlyat Hawker Siddeley but with a small proportion at equipment firms and sub-contractors, would rise from the present 16 per cent to perhaps27 per cent, representing extra work to the value of some  250,000 peraircraft.    There would not be a proportionate increase hi development work.2
U,       The A300B would rank third, after the BAG 3U and Lockheed L1011ain BEA*s choice.    BEA estimate that it would probably cost them more to run than the other two aircraft, and that there is danger of the aircraftbeing late and short on performance.    My Department shares these views.We understand that BEA would accordingly seek formal indemnities from her MajestyTs Government if they are made to buy the A300B.12.       The officials discussion has, however, made it clear that, just asthe other Governments feel unable to direct their airlines, they would not expect us to direct BEA, who could thus be left free to make a commercialchoice if we so wished.13.       We could expect good political dividends from re-entry into theA300B.    It would generate goodwill and lead to further proposals forco-operation.    There are signs that the time is now ripe for a seriousdialogue on the possibilities of co-operation in particular betv/eenRolls Royce and the Continental engine firms.    Thus, it would be a step towards a European aircraft industry.14.       On the other hand, there are significant risks that the project will fail to come up to expectations, and the effectiveness of French (SNIAS)management under competitive pressures is suspect, particularly as theywill be heavily stretched On Concorde at the same time as the A300B.Re-entering at this stage, we should exert little influence on design orproject policy, and differences of opinion on production policies orunderwriting could be continuing sources of friction,    Govex-nments are meeting by far the greater part of the costs and risks of the project.    this may have been unavoidable, but It is not a good precedent for the future,and it is more lax than our own policies for launching aid which, forexample, has always stopped short of sharing production risks (except inthe case of Concorde).15.       Furthermore, the discussion between officials has established that,provided we do not launch the BAG 311, we could open negotiations for widerco-operation with Europe without formal re-entry into the A300B, though inthis case, not unnaturally, the other side would be less enthusiastic and progress would at best be slower.    Our case would rest not only on presentcollaborative projects, but also on the fact that we should be bringing intothe partnership far greater experience and resources than any other european country.    The French and Germans appreciate the critical valueof Rolls Royce as a potential nucleus for a future European aero-engineindustry which would be strong enough to withstand American penetration.16.       In summary, on our usual basis of economic appraisal, the A300Bproject is too dear and risky to be attractivej but re-entry carries with itpotential advantages of a broader type which we may otherwise find it moredifficult to achieve.BAG 311 WITH RB211-6117.       The Cabinet has already looked at this proposal; the main figures are repeated at Annex II.    (They are presented on a slightly different basis,to ensure comparability with the other options, and assume 100 per cent3
Government funding of the RB211-61 engine, since Rolls Royce are no longerable to contribute to the launching cost).    It is unlikely that any additional funds will now be forthcoming from the private sector.18. The cost to Her MajestyTs Government would be  144 million, spreadas follows (  million);-	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	TotalAirframe	4	13	16	20	20	11	84Engine		9	18	18	7	8	60Total	4	22	34	38	27	19	144To these figures should be added an appropriate share of any nationalwage and material cost escalation.19.       At 240 sales, the Governments cash break-even point, the projectwould produce exports or import savings worth some  1,400 million in cashterms.    (The comparable discounted figures are a Government loss of 50 million and earnings of  550 million.)   This does not of courserepresent a net gain to the balance of payments since alternative use of theresources (e.g. in the engineering industry) will produce exports or saveimports, but we are talking of the decade 1975-1985 and beyond, and thealternative resource use and output so far ahead Is quite impossible to forecast.20.      Full responsibility for the cost over-runs on the airframe (apartfrom Her Majesty^s Governments share of escalation), and for financingproduction, would rest with She British Aircraft Corporation (BAG).    Withtheir additional  12 million of capital for which firm underwritingarrangements have been made, BAG should have sufficient resources forthis task.21.       For Rolls Royce, the position is less clear pending completion ofSir Henry Bensonts examination&quot; of the company finances.    By the relevant period (1974 and later), they should, on the basis of their currentforecasts, have returned to a position of profitability.    But we cannot be certain of this, nor can we be certain that the launching cost can be contained within the estimate of  60 million.    Following the experiencewhich they have gained with the RB211-22, there seems no reason to doubtthat Rolls Royce have the technical and managerial ability to develop andmanage the RB211-61 successfully.22.      Nevertheless, the new Rolls Royce Board have confirmed that they regard the RB211-51 engine in the BAG 311 (with possible later applicationsin the Lockheed aircraft) as the best course for them commercially, andas providing the best prospects for Her MajestyTs Government of recovery of its investment in the RB211 series of engines as a whole.    They haveexpressed confidence in the estimate of  60 million.4
23.       The advantages of the BAG 311 in preserving BAC*s successful civil aircraft team at Weybridgee and in providing employment in the aircraft equipment and other industries (including Shorts in Northern Ireland) havebeen dealt with in CP(70) 74, paragraphs 38-43.    Collaborativearrangements with European countries were outlined in paragraph 49 ofthe same paper.24        K we develop the RB211-S1 for the BAC 311, the engines would beavailable to meet JLockheedls probable needs, for an additional installationcost estimated at  10 million.    Sale of the RB211-61 engines in a stretchedLockheed aircraft should improve sales of the RB211-22 in the basic L1011.25       At a later stage, BAG might wish to offer a slightly smaller version of the aircraft v/Ith the RB211-22 engine for American airlines who havealready bought trijets.    The airframe and engine costs of this version havenot been assessed, but would be unlikely to exceed a total of  30 million.It would not be embarked upon unless sufficient sales could be assumed,and the manufacturers found a major part of the launching cost.26.      If it is felt that we should support the BAC 311, but could not commit ourselves fully to the RB211-51 engine until Rolls Roycets financial positionis clearer and more progress has been made on the RB211-22, it would be feasible for BAC to keep the option open for some four months to the end ofMarch 1971.    J a at the end of that period, it was decided not to proceedwith the RB211-51, BAC could fall back on the GE engine without losingtime (see paragraph 27 below).    If we wished to adopt this course,however, we should have to give full authority for the BAG 311 straight away,and limited contract cover (within a maximum of, 2. 5 million) forthe RB211-S1.BAC 311 WITH GE ENGINES27.      The cost to Her majesty*s Government would be  84 million, plus a share of escalation, on the assumption, yet to be established, that GEwould finance the costs of adapting their engine, which would be imported from America.    (Rolls Royce believe that it would be commerciallydamaging for them to manufacture a rival engine).    The aircraft would be acceptable to BEA, and would be likely to command slightly higher sales,particularly in the USA, than a Rolls Royce engined version.28,      Though this course is a fall back position if the RB211-S1 is dropped,it would be regarded as strongly anti-European and would damageRolls Royce *s reputation.TAKE NO ACTION29.      BEA would be left free to decide between the L1011 and A300B.    Thetotal foreign exchange savings (as compared with buying a wholly foreignaircraft like the Douglas DC10) would be about  120 million (if BEA buy theL10U, and about  24 million (if BEA buy the A300B).
30.       If BEA (unexpectedly) decide to order the A300B, we should gainsome political advantage, and more work for Hawker Siddeley.31.       E BEA ordered the LI Oil we should gain the following advantage ss-a. a boost for Lockheed and the L1011, and an increasedreturn on our investment in the RB211-22;b. termination of our underwriting liability of up to 5 million on the Air Holdings arrangements.The British work proportion of the LI Oil over the life of the project is higher than that proposed in the A3003 (without RoUs Royce engines).32.      It still seems probable that Lockheed will pull through their present financial difficulties; the LI Oil has just made a successful maiden flight,and is due in service in a yearns time.CONCLUSIONSRE-ENTRY INTO A300Bi0 Launching the R3211-51 engine in this project is not justified by prospective sales.ii.        The costs and uncertainties of re-entry into the airframemust be weighed against the gaines of political goodwill in Europe,and of a better foundation for future European aircraft collaboration.BEA need not be compelled to buy the aircraft against their will,STAY OUT OF A300B, BUT DIRECT BEA TO BUY ITThi3 half-way course has nothing to commend it.BAG 311- with R3 211-61Costs are high, but are spread over a number of years.Would bring considerable benefit to the airframe industry, andRolls Royce (and hence to our large present investment In theRB211), and to the aircraft equipment industry.- with. GE engineWould be a blow to Rolls R.oyce, and would substantially Impedeprogress towards a European aero-engine industry built aroundRolls Royce, but shares the other advantages of the BAG 311 withRolls Royce engine.6
Though success cannot be guaranteed and we must recognise that we shouldbe jeopardising an early move towards a unified European aircraft industry,I believe that the balance of national advantage lies in supporting the bac 311,    This should preferably-be with RB211-61 engines, but theGE engine represents a useful fall-back position if we wish to avoid a fullcommitment to the RB211-61 now (paragraph 24 above).DO NOTHINGWe leave BEA free to buy L10H, with gains for Rolls Royce and Lockheed,or the A300B, with gains for Hawker Slddeley.Need not close the door to discussion aimed at establishing closer permanentlinks with Europe, though progress would not be as rapid and our negotiating position would be weaker.F V GMinistry of Aviation Supply SW126 November 19707
Annex IExtract from Minister of Aviation Supply&apos;sletter to the three Governments,  3/11/706.     There are therefore three crucial questions which I amobliged to put to you on behalf of HMG before they candecide whether to accept the invitation to participate inthe development and production of the A300B.(l) To what extent are the French/German/Dutch Governmentsable and willing to influence their national and independentairlines to ensure that they undertake both to purchase a givennumber of their requirements for the A300B in the form of B7sand that all their B7 purchases would be Rolls Royce engined:and in the light of such an undertaking, what would be thetotal number of RR engined A300B7s which your national and independent airlines would purchase.(2) What is your detailed analysis of the total salesexpected for the A300B, with and without Rolls Royce engines?(3) Are the French/German/Dutch Governments prepared to share the costs and risks of launching the RB.211-61:    andif so on what basis?
Annex I contd.Text of a&apos;letter sent to the Minister of Aviation Supply-by M. Mondon, French Minister of Transport, in his ownname and on behalf of his German and Dutch colleagues_on 14th November       _Paris, 14th November, 1970Dear Minister,1.     Herr Rohwedder, State Secretary for Economic affairs in the Federal German Republic, Mr. Keyzer, State Secretaryfor Transport and Waterways in the Netherlands and I have carefully studied your letter of the 3rd. November, and wewere very pleased on this occasion to note the considerationyou are giving to our proposal that you should again participate in the development of the European Airbus A300B.We each received your message individually, set out in thesame terms, and have agreed to send you a joint reply.     Inorder to clarify our reply to the greatest possible extent,we should first of all like to recall the circumstances inwhich we made the proposal referred to.2.     After Great Britain withdrew from the European Airbusprogramme at the beginning of 1969, Federal Germany and France,in deciding to continue, gave the UK - and this is duly recorded in the preamble to their agreement of 29th May, 1969 - theopportunity of once more taking its place in the programme with the same rights and the same obligations as themselves and to the extent allowed by the advancement of the programme.The desire to widen the support for a large-capacityaircraft programme, fundamental to the future of the Europeanindustry, and that of avoiding a disastrous rivalry amongEuropeans in the face of powerful international competition,prompted Federal Germany, France and the Netherlands,  their new partner,  to renew officially the invitation extended tothe United Kingdom to re-enter the Airuus A300B programme.For this reason, they sent the UK on 23rd October last,a proposal designed in such a way as to allow the UK, whileobserving decisions already taken, to take a place in the project once more which would be worthy of its reputation inaeronautics, while including a moderate financial effort.In short, being anxious to ensure solid foundations inthe future for European engine firms, on, the same lines as thelong-term considerations which Britain had expressed concerningits national industry, the three participating countrieswidened their offer by proposing, on 28th October,  that a detailed investigation of this question should he \mdertakenjointly.Our comments and our replies to the points raised inyour message are therefore based on a consideration of allthese factors.3.     You view with favour the idea of undertaking a jointinvestigation of the possibilities of closer collaboration/between
between the European engine manufacturers and you alsoexpress a wish to extend this investigation to the airframesector.We have noted the latter suggestion with great interestand, as a matter of fact, we believe that solutions to the airbus problem at the European level will have a greatinfluence on the future competitiveness of the Europeanairframe industry.     The market for large short/medium haulsubsonic transport aircraft is at present one where we canattain a favourable position, bearing in mind the characteristics of the European air network.     In order to take real advantageof this situation, it is even so essential that the number of aircraft produced should reach levels which are sufficientlyclose to those of American manufacturers.     That is why wethink it essential, for a programme such as the Airbus, tohave a production target of at least 350 to 400 aircraft.Market researches carried out show that this target is within reach of the manufacturers of the A300B and could even be considerably surpassed, on condition, of course, thatcontinental Europe does not divide its strength unproductivelybetween two competing programmes, compromising the long-termfuture of its aeronautical industry and running the risk ofthen having, to rely to a larger extent on purchases of equipment made in other countries.In these conditions,  it seems to us that the A300B Airbusshould in the next fifteen years, form a focal point for.applying European co-operation on a large scale to airframes,and we are firmly of the opinion that there could be no realfuture for closer co-operation between our aircraft firmswithout active participation by the UK -in this programme.4.     We have three comments on paragraph 4 of your letter:A) We are most happy to recall that British Aircraft corporation is already a vital partner in important European collaborationprogrammes such as the Concorde,  the ME.CA and the Jaguar.We do not mean by this that these European projects provideBAC with an adequate workload, since this is a matter for your judgment alone.     But what we should like to emphasiseis that this firm is not viewed with disfavour in continentalEurope, quite the reverse,  in fact. 6B) If BAC did not participate, even at the beginning, in theEuropean Airbus project, it was because the UK Government, for reasons of its own, freely chose the firm of Hawker Siddeley.C) Our proposal includes,  for UK industry, a. larger proportionof work than that at present allocated to HSA and your Governmentwill be gree to give a share of it to BAC if so desired.5.     As regards the engine we entirely agree with your pointof view that there would be no advantage in developing theKB.211-61 without knowing whether there was a market for suchan engine.     This is the case with every industrial projectwhen the time comes for a decision on whether to launch it.We launched the A300B Airbus bearing in mind considerations of this kind, i.e. Its chances of commercial success.Apart from this, we considered that the best way for the/firms
firms to carry out&apos; their programme was for the responsibleGovernments not to impose purchasing guarantees on theirairlines, so that the attitude of these companies may hedetermined, now and in future, by the technical, price and time schedule guarantees offered by the manufacturers.     Thisabsence of restraint will ensure that orders placed by thenational airlines constitute a valuable commercial recommendation.What applies to the airframe also applies to the engine.The first choices of the airlines were made in favour ofGeneral Electric and will continue to be so as long asRolls Royce is unable to offer guarantees on the performance,cost and in-service date of its engine.6.     The reply to the first of the three questions in paragraph of your letter stems directly from such considerations.In the absence of a competitive aircraft and engine,Lufthansa and KLM have bought DC 10-30s fitted with the GeneralElectric CP 6-50 A engine,     Similarly Air France and Lufthansahave issued &quot;letters of intent&apos;&quot; to order A300Bs with the sameengine.It is probable that, because of the rate of traffic growththese airlines will be obliged to buy the elongated version of the B7 at a later date in quantities which they have notyet decided.     As regards the choice of engine for this version,they will be faced with the following alternative:To continue with a General Electric engine, or to buy the RB.211-61 Rolls Royce engine.-The following factors will have a major effect on thischoice:- the competitiveness of the Rolls Royce engine in comparisonwith the General Electric engine;- the. possibility of setting up a maintenance pool, withBEA for example, if such a pool should prove to be a useful means of reducing costs;- the possibility of Western European airlines coming closer together than they are at present which, should theoccasion arise, would allow fleets to be constitutedwhich would be large enough to improve the operatingeconomies of AJOOBs fitted with two different types of engine.Finally, we suggested to you in London that the attentionof our airlines should be drawn to our idea regarding european co-operation among the engine firms, stressing, in addition,that in this latter field, this could lead to the &quot;creationof the closest possible ties between the firms in the western european countries concerned.7.     In regard t o the results of the market study which weremade known to you in London, we should like to point out thatthey were drawn up on the following assumptions:- the competitiveness of the Rolls Royce RB.211 engine;/ -the
- the first certification of the Bl version with aGeneral Electric engine;- the first certification of the B7 version with aRolls Royce engine, which assumes that the first order for this version will be placed with a Rolls Royce engine.The detailed market analysis was made after numerouscontacts over several months by the Sales teams of AirbusInternational with airlines all over the world, including those of the USA, and after simulating various economicconditions for airlines&apos; networks, worked out in close collaboration with the airlines.The results cover the hoped-for sales of the Bl and B7versions with the CP 6 or RB 211 engine.S.     As regards your third question, I should like to remindyou of the detailed statements made by M. Rohwedder, Secretaryof State on the 23rd and 28th October 1970, under which theproblems of financing the Rolls Royce RB.211-61. engine could,as necessary, be dealt with on a bilateral basis between theFederal German Republic and the UK.9.     In response to your request, we have asked our respective departments to let yourrepresentatives have any explanationsyou consider necessary after reading our letter, before our meeting in Amsterdam, which we hope will, be very soon.Sgnd.

In the earlier presentation they were subsumed in the analysis of the other options, the figures for which reflected the fact thata decision in favour of one of the alternatives would mean abandoning the lev;and foreign exchange receipts which would result (at no cost to public funds)if BEA bought Tristars.   With the increase in the range of options to beconsidered this simplified presentation is no longer practicable.    Hence the apparent slight improvement in some of the results eg the preference andsubsidy figures for the BAC 311.    The relative attractiveness of the variouscourses of action is not affected by the new presentation.(b) The A300B figures are based on the proposals by the European Governments.The comparable figures in CP(70)74 related to the Hawker Siddeley proposals.(c) An operating subsidy to BEA of  lOIvI is included in the Government lossesshown against the A300B in Columns 3,4 ana 5 in Table I and the A300Bcoluim in Table II.(d) IMJ recoveries from A300B sales take no account of the contingent losses on production financing (para. 9 of the paper). -
