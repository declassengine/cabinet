IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS government cp(70) 107 -COPY NO18 November 1970CABINETGAS AND ELECTRICITY prices memorandum by the Secretary of State for trade and industry at their meeting on 16 November the Social Services committee invited me, in bringing the proposals for increases in the price of gas and electricity back to Cabinet, to circulate a paper setting out certainalternative possibilities on electricity prices.THE INDUSTRIES&apos; proposals.     The industries proposals, as we have them, ares-Electricity - 13 per cent, but averaging about ?.0 per centfci domestic consumersGas - 6. 3 per cent, but averaging 8-9 per cent for domestic consumers.For electricity it is relevant to note that, pending the formulation of detailed proposals by the area boards, we have had only a general indication of the changes intended.    Th.3 Electricity Board proposals areexpected to provide for increases in prices for domestic consumers inthe different areas between 17 per cent and 23 per cent.    But if the boardsalso proposed alterations in tariff structure, the effect on individualconsumers could be outside this range and this will almost certainly bethe case with the off-peak tariffs where, because fuel is the main element in the costs, the increase is likely to be 25 per cent or so in most areas.For the smaller commercial and industrial consumers, the increases willnot exceed - and will frequently be less - than for domestic consumers.For large consumers - notably industry - who have had the effects of increases in fuel costs passed on to them whenever a rise has occurredand who have not, therefore, had the three years&apos; stability enjoyed bydomestic consumers, the boards are expected to propose no increasesbeyond the automatic passing on to them of the recent rise in fuel costs.I
MY PROPOSAL3.     My proposal is that the Gas and Electricity Industries should proceed with putting their proposals to their Consultative Councils subjecttoj-i,       a deletion from their calculations of any specialallowance for wage increases next year;ii.       my consideration of a possible shading of any largepercentage increases to domestic consumers of electricity,VARIANTS SUGGESTED BY THE SOCIAL SERVICES committee .     The Committee suggested consideration of the followingpossibilities for the electricity price increase;-L       reduce the overall increase to 10 per cent;ii,       reduce the overall increase to 10 per cent but in such away as to maintain the 1967 relationship between domestic andother prices;iii.       reduce the overall increase to 10 per cent but in such away that no domestic consumer paid -a,-  more than 15 per cent more;b.    more than 12 per cent more.5.     It is theoretically possible to distribute the increase betweenthe classes in more than one way; the attached table presents the most likely effects of introducing the limitations referred to in Committee,6,     It is important to note, however, that the Electricity Council is opposed to raising prices to large industrial consumers as they consider this would not be justified by the costs of supply.7,     It should also be borne in mind that Boards1 financial circumstancesvary considerably so that standard increases for domestic and otherconsumers may leave some Boards in the red - ie, not only failing tomeet their financial objectives but making deficits,8,     I remain of the view that we should accept that consultations withthe Consultative Councils should now go forward on the basis proposedin paragraphs 2 and 3 above.    We shall have another opportunity toexamine the proposals after they have been considered by the Councils;and in the meantime I will explore with the electricity industry thepossibility of some marginal shading of any very high percentage increases, where this can be done at only a small cost in increasedborrowings from the Exchequer,J d department of Trade and Industry SWl18 November 1970 2
