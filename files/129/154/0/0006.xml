DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY lS government cp(70) 106 COPY NO.    J &apos;12 November 1970CABINETINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BILL: APPLICATIONTO THE CROWNMemorandum by the Secretary of State for EmploymentMy colleagues will recall that in the consultative document onthe Industrial Relations Bill we made it clear that the armed forces and the police would be excluded from the scope of our proposals;apart from that, we avoided giving any indication how far the bill would bind the Crown.    There is, however, a strong case fordifferentiating as little as possible as between its application to Crownemployees and other employees, our policy would inevitably look lesscredible if the Government failed to take the medicine it had prescribedfor other employees.2.     The Ministerial Committee on Industrial Relations has now considered and agreed the extent to which the Bill should apply to theCrown, subject to two point is.       Enforceability of collective agreements.ii.       Disclosure of information.ENFORCEABILITY OF COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTS3,     The Bill will provide that all written collective agreements made between unions and employers or employers* organisations will be presumed to be intended by the parties to be legally binding exceptinsofar as the agreements contain express provisions to the contrary;the Bill will also provide that any party to a procedure agreement may seek to have it made legally enforceable, upon the order of the national industrial Relations Court (NIRC), where this is thought essential tosecure and maintain orderly industrial relations.4.     The Lord Privy Seal, while fully recognising the presentationaldifficulty of exempting the Crown from this provision, is concerned about its practical effect on the Whitley system.    In his view this is to be distinguished from the negotiating arrangements developed by other largeemployers and the s afrao of Crov7a eaymyto differs from that of other employees in that they are subject to Crown prerogative and do not have1
contracts on employment.    The Whitley system has evolved as the best method of carrying on negotiations in this special situation and, in theview of both the official and staff sides, its character and procedureswould be radically changed were agreements to become legally binding.This would introduce rigidity and formality which would undermineexisting close relationships and might harm industrial relations in theCivil Service and increase the risk of industrial action.    This could notbe avoided by including provision in the agreements themselves that theyshould not be enforceable because the staff side have already said that,if the Crown is bound under this provision they would insist that theGovernment should bind itself to fulfil its agreements with them.5.     While recognising these fears, it does not in my view necessarily follow that application to the Crown of the provisions regardingenforceability need have these results.    The blend of formal and informalarrangements in the Whitley system is paralleled in other largeorganisations in the private sector and need not change simply becausethe legal status of agreements may be changed.    What is more important is that the argument against application in the Civil Service can beadduced with equal or greater force in the private sector? and theGovernment cannot convincingly argue that the consequences oferjforceability are peculiar to Crown employment.    IndeedP if we wereto present this point of view in Parliament to defend Crown exemption from this provision, we would risk undermining our whole case (asspelt out in paragraphs 112 and 113 of the consultative document) for creating the presumption about the legal enforceability of collective agreements.    In my view, therefore, these provisions must apply to theCrown as they apply to other employers.DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION6.     The consultative document proposes requirements on employers to disclose informations-.&apos;e,    to registered trade unions in negotiations, in accordance with provisions to fcs laid down in a Code of Practice jb.    to employers, in accordance with regulations made under theBill.In each case the Bill would provide absolute safeguards for certain sortsof information which need to be protected from disclosure - for example,information involving national security, information which is confidential for commercial reasons, and personal details about individuals unless they have given their consent,7.     In relation to the Crown we also propose providing that a minister may withhold information if he is satisfied that its disclosure would be against the national interest.    We were, however, unable to agreewhether - contrary to the currently accepted practice, e. g. in relation2
to the determination of questions whether the Crown is obliged toproduce documents which are subject to Crown privilege - the Billshould provide for a Ministerss certificate that disclosure would be against the national interest to be final.8.     I favour relying on the present practice? the Lord Privy Sealfavours certification by a Minister.    In his view it is for theGovernment of the day to determine whether official information should be published or made available to anyone outside the publicservice, and it is unsatisfactory that the final decision on disclosureshould lie with NIRC, even if its decisions are reached in private.Although Ministers could, in the last resort, still reject an NIRCdecision that the information should be disclosed, they would then haveto defend their action in Parliament and it would appear that theGovernment were breaking their own law.9.     That situation should, however, arise only rarely under my proposal to follow Crown privilege practice.    In other cases, wherethe NIRC endorse a Minister&apos;s refusal of information, the Governmentwould of course be fully protected against criticism by the court&apos;decision.   By contrast if we provide for the ministers certificate to be final, we could be exposed to the embarrassment of having to defend the action in evevy instance.10.    Some members of the Committee question whether it ismeaningful to accept, on behalf of the Crown the obligation the Bill willplace on employers generally to provide their employees with annualstatements on the progress of the undertaking.    I recognise that this may not be necessary or desirable in all Government establishments.However, the Bill already provides that the Secretary of State may by regulation exempt employers from the duty of providing Information totheir employees to the extent that he thinks it necessary or expedient,which could be used to exempt Government Departments from this obligation to the extent that Ministers might agree that to be appropriate.I believe that this provision should meet my colleagues concern.11.     I invite my colleagues to decide -i.    whether the Crown should be bound by the provisions of theBill relating to enforce ability of collective agreements jii.    whether the Bill should provide for a Minister!scertificate that disclosure of information is contrary to^jhenational interest should be final, or whether this shouldyfordecision by NIRC in accordance with current practice forcases yf Crown privilege.R department of Employment, SW112 November 1970 3
