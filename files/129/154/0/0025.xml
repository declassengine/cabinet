HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*3 government cp(70) 125 COPY NO     [)j31 December 1970CABINETDOCTORS1 AND DENTISTS4 PAY REVIEW BODYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department, My colleagues will recall (CM(70) 30th Conclusions, Minute 5) thatwe decided to set up three new pay review bodies to deal respectively withtop salaries of public services a Arrned Forces pay and doctors anddentists1 pay.    They were to have a degree of common memberships and acommon secretariat which would be provided by the proposed Office of manpower Economics (OME), the conduct of whose affairs would be independent of Government control.2.        These decisions were announced in the House of Commons on  November in a statement which made specific reference to our intention that the three review bodies would have a degree of Interlocking membership and a secretariat, which would work to their directions,, provided by OME,3.        For the doctors and dentists, the &quot;independence&quot; of &quot;their&quot; review body is an article of faith.    Because the OME will draw some of its staff fromthe National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) they are deeplysuspicious that the review body will be under this or some other kind ofindirect Government influence.    In discussion with the Secretary of Statefor Social Services they have accepted that the same secretary can serveall three review bodiest but have come up with the irrational proposal that,in order to ensure a fair and truly independent pay examination, he shouldbe drawn from the Cabinet Office and not from OME.    This they claimwould enable them to sell our proposals to their members,4.        The Secretary of State for Social Services would like to make this concession, which he thinks need be no more than a formality since he would hope to persuade the professions that the official secretary from theCabinet Office would have to maintain close links with the OME, and perhap seven have a room there^ 30 that there would be Uttle practical differencebetween the arrangement he proposes and our present intention of having thewhole secretariat provided by OME.   And, if we force the issue against theBritish Medical Association^ (BMA*s) and British Dental A.ssociationxs(BDArs) advice v/e would risk a new crisis in the professions1 relationship with the National Health Service of the kind we faced when we came to office.1
5. While recognising that risk the Ministerial Steering Committee on pay Negotiations felt that even if, as claimed^ our agreement to appoint aCabinet Office secretary to the review bodies need be no more than apresentational device, the professions would have to claim it as a concession of substance in order to carry their members and thus the Governmentsresolve in carrying through their announced policies would be called inquestion.,    Moreover, the appointment of a Cabinet Office secretary in place of one from the OMffi would be seen by Members of Parliament,, whosepay is to be considered by the top salaries revJew body., not as ensuring theindependence of that body from the Government bvt rather as endangeringit; and the review body on Armed Forces pay could not do its workadequately without the benefit of the special skill and experience whichreside in the NBPI staffs who are to transfer to the OMEB60        We have throughout made it plain to the doctors and dentists that the body which is to review their remuneration must in future operate on thesame footing as other advisory bodies reviewing pay in the public sector.Howevers v/e have also assured the professions that the findings of the newreview bodies wJQU. not be referred to any other outside body? and that theGovernment,, while reserving to itself the right of final decision, will acceptthe recommendations unless there are clear and compelling reasons to thecontrary.7.        La the view of the Ministerial Steering Committee on pay negotiations this Is as far as we should go.    They consider therefore thatthe doctorsT and dentists request for a Cabinet Office secretary should be turned down, and that we should adhere to our announced Intention that the secretariat of all three review bodies should be drawn from the OME,    invite the Cabinet to endorse this conclusion.R M11Home Office S\7131 December 1970
