DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 12331 December 1970CABINETCHANNEL, tunnel memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment the Economic Policy Committee on 21 December(EPC(7 0) 22nd Meeting) a^cepteds subject to final studies and to agreement on financial proposals that a rail Channel Tunnel was bothfeasible and economic and,that, neither a bridge nor a road tunneloffered practicable alternatives.    With the probable growth of traffic in mind, they also accepted such a tunnel as preferable to continuedreliance on sea and air transport alone,2.     The Committee, in order not to delay at any rate the first stage of the final studies, was prepared to authorise the expenditure of  500,00QoThe French Government could then be informed of our acceptance inprinciple of the project and of our willingness to go ahead immediatelywith the studies..    We could;, at the same time, make clear our wish to reconsider the financial proposals with a view, if possible, to limiting the extent to which public funds were involved,3.     The present financial proposals, which have been largely acceptedby the French Government, were put forward by the international group ofprivate concerns listed at Annex A,    In outline, these proposals are asfollowsFINAL STUDIES (2-3 years)These would prepare for the final decision whether to build or not.The first  2 million would come from private risk capital; afurther  2 million would be indemnifiable by governments! andany further costs would be subject to later agreement.    the studies would fail naturally into three phases, each providing thebasis for opting whether or not to proceed with the next, asfollows i-(i)     Concept definition and traffic studies (10 months and about  500,000).J1COPY NO
(ii)     Detailed cost estimates and final traffic and revenuestudies (12 months and about  l-f- million).(iii)      Treaty, legislation,, contract preparations (9 months and about   2 million) (Trials or preliminary worksmay also be begun in this phase, at additional costup to about  5 million).CONSTRUCTION (4-6 years)The private group would raise finance (at 1970 prices,, about 280 million) and arrange for construction.    Only 5-15 per cent of the finance would be private &quot;risk money&quot;; the rest would befixedsrinterest debt guaranteed by the Governments.OPERATION AND REMUNERATIONOn completion, the tunnel would be handed over to an Anglo-French public operating authority, which would, own the property.The private group would retain a right to remuneration, for 0 years, out of the revenues.    This would service the group&apos;sfixed-interest debt and give a limited share of profits to theirshareholders, on a formula basis? but, on present forecasts,the bulk of the net surplus would be retained by the opere.tingauthority (or the governments as the case might be),4.     If, at this s*:age, it were at all possible to reduce the involvement,of the public sector, we would wish to do so.    We therefore need a chance to explore workable alternatives, if only on the British side.At the same time, unless the first phase of the final studies is begun inthe next month or se, there is a risk of losing a whole year because of the seasonal nature of the work.     The longer we delay a decision, the moreplanning difficulties we create elsewhere and the more economic benefitswe would lose if the tunnel were to be built.    More particularly, west and to lose the collaboration not only of the private group but also ofRio Tinto Zinc as potential project managers.    It is thus desirable tofind ways (including consultation with the other parties) of startingright away the first phase of the studies.5,     While the ideal would, of course, be to reopen the financial discussions ab initxo, we have to accept that the French Governmenthave already agreed to the gone-sial framework of the proposals.    Webelieve, however, that there are some details which they would be glad to discuss and it must be our hope that they would be willing to talk more widely, on the basis that final studies are started in the meantime.6.     I seek the approval of my colleagues for the Minister for transport Industries to start discussions with the French Minister onthe basis s-(i)     that in principle we endorse the concept of a railChannel Tunnelsc2
(ii)     that we wish to start the tf&amp;ial studies now (with the risk that it might fall to us to cover the whole ^ or at any rate,more than an equal share *. of the cost oC the fhvQt stage,up to  500j,000)$(iii)     that we wish., nevertheless, to explore the possibility of alternative ways for the finance and pursuit of the projectgenerally, before reaching joint deciaions on the financingproposals now before us, or on the part to be played in the project at; a whole by the present private group,?.     We should^ of course, work c?.osely throughout with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs s and in due course the current financing proposals,with any workable alternatives that emerge, would be put back to mycolleagues for consideration in detail.    We would also seek to ensure,in consultation with the Law Officers,, that any immediate agreement inrespect of the start of final studies involved no commitment on her majesty&apos;s Governments part to proceed beyond the first ( 500, 000)stage described abcvej. nor, indeed, to the construction of a ChannelTunnel,P w department ox the Environment, SW131 December 19703
