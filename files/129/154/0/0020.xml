DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S government cp(70) 12021 December 1970CABINETUPPER CLYDE SHIPBUILDERS LIMITEDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industryand President of the Board of trade, I consulted the Economic Policy Committee last week abouf theaction I should take with respect to Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Ltd, (UCS)which has had about  20 million from public funds.    UCS are not seekingfurther financial assistance but shipowners want the usual credit guarantees for ships ordered from them,,    In the special circumstances of thecompany, I do not think these should be given but, if they are not,UCS cannot go on trading and there will be heavy redundancies in glasgow,2. The Committee agreed that the best course was to try to persuade the UCS management that the company did not have a future and to secure their agreement tc an orderly rundown.    It would be important for the Government not to appear to have discriminated harshly againstUCS, particularly bearing in mind the proposals to avoid the closure ofHarland and &quot;Wolff Ltd.    I was asked to report these conclusions and their reception by UCS to the Cabinet.    I immediately saw UCS and asked themto let me know their views today.3. The provision of the credit guarantees under Section 7 of the shipbuilding Industry Act 1967 has the following implicationsa.      It assumes that the Government expects UCS to complete theships over the next two years,    I have, however, evidence on their financial prospects which leads me to doubt if they will,    AlthoughUCS has now worked off the loss making orders, the company,after two years during each of which they lost  10 million, expectedas late as this August to make a profit of  1, 4 million in the year to end August 1971,    Now they expect a  2. 4 million loss this year butthink they can go on trading in expectation of turning to profit late in 1971.COPY NOS3
b. The amount of guaranteed bank loans at risk from UCS failureis now about  14 million but, if the guarantees continue to be given,the amount may rise in due course to  25 million.c. Moreover in some cases now under consideration, ouradvisers on the credit-worthiness of shipowners seeking guaranteeshave warned us that, if UCS fails to complete the ships, theshipowner s may default on their guaranteed loans and we wouldthen have to repay the lending bank.d. We should also have to be prepared to make some adjust-ments to existing loans of  llf million to UCS from public fundsby subordination to other debts^ by converting those we could toan equity holding, or by writing them off.4.        If we withhold these credit guarantees from shipowners, UCS saythey would have to go into liquidation by the end of December.    As a result -a. It might be said that v/e had discriminated against UCSbecause I give similar credit guarantees to other shipbuilderswhose future is not assured.    (In these cases I have had neithersimilarly specific evidence leading to doubts as to the shipbuilder^ability to complete the orders in question nor similar warningsabout the effect of failure to complete the orders on the creditsworthiness of some of the shipowner customers seeking guarantees).b. Yarrow (Shipbuilders) Ltd., one of the principal suppliers tothe Royal Navy and overseas navies, would be involved because UCSstill have a 51 per cent holding.    I should, however, expect theoriginal parent company who still own 49 per cent to buy the UCSholding.c. Left to himself, the liquidator would probably makeimmediately redundant the majority of UCS employees (atpresent 8., 000 excluding Yarrows),    Nearly all the rest mightbe dismissed within three to four months.    However, theScotstoun yard employing 1, 200 might be quickly taken overand possibly Govan later, employing at present 3,Q00fi    Clydebank,also employing 3,000, is unlikely to be revived.    In due courseYarrow and Lower Clyde might also take up another 1,000 workers as their output rises.d. Merchant ship orders from New Zealand, Brazil and theRepublic of Ireland are among those affected.    (Work has hardlystarted on these, and UCS failure at a later stage in 1971 couldincrease the difficult&apos;/).
50 November male unemployment in the Glasgow travel to work area was already 26^084 (707 per cent) and UCS redundancies would have aserious impact in certain localities within Glasgow.    The Governmentcould intervene to phase out dismissals in two complementary ways.First it could offer to make grants to the liquidator for a few weeks ifnecessary to give him time to negotiate with shipowners,,    He would,however, probably still have to lay off cs 000 or more quickly.    Secondly,the Government could offer grants towards the extra costs which ship-owners must expect to incur in. arranging completion of ships reasonablyadvanced.    These extra costs are not expected to attract investmentgrant or credit under the normal arrangements.6.        The cost of such arrangements and their effect on the redundanciescan be assessed only in consultation with the liquidator and in the light ofhis negotiations with shipowner customers.    We cannot assume that such arrangements will be acceptable.    But cn the basis that 5,000 of UCS89000 employees could be re-employed in Clyde shipbuilding in the courseof a year, the benefits of such arrangements might be to keep employment at UCS yards up to about 4, Q00 throughout as against the 2, 000 to which itmight fall in two months or so, if such action were not taken.    This wouldalso ease the impact on UCS sub-contractors and suppliers.7.        I will report orally on UCS views but, unless they have somethingnew and worthwhile to say, I would recommend that credit guarantees be refused to shipowners for orders at UCS but that we should announce our willingness to consider financial assistance for the completion of ships which are well advanced.J d department of Trade and Industry SW121 December 1970
