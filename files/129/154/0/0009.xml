IjDCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY lS government cp(70) 109 COPY NO  gg18 November 1970CABINETGAS AND ELECTRICITY prices memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury the Social Services Committee invited the Minister for industry to arrange for further examination of the proposed price increases for electricity and to report the results to Cabinet, beforethe first formal meeting with the Electricity Consultative Council on20 November.2.      The Minister for Industry has provided us with a series ofcosted options for reductions in the proposed electricity price increases on lines discussed in the Social Services Committee,    Theseshow that most of the proposals entail a loss of  40 million a yearand some could cost  70 million -  80 million a year.3.      I should like to emphasise to my colleagues that the reductionin the revenues of the industries would involve a direct and corresponding burden on the Exchequer.    It is not just a question of reducing the financial targets set for these industries.    They are bothalready planning to borrow substantial amounts for their necessary,and overwhelmingly committed, investment from the National loans fund.   Any reduction in their planned surplus will mean a correspondingaddition to their borrowing requirements.    The changes in the electricityprice proposals discussed by the Social Services Committee would increase the electricity industryrs borrowing by  40 million a year, ormore.4.      Of course these price increases are unwelcome.    It is essentialthat we do not relax our efforts to contain the wage and cost increasesthat generate price increases of this kind.    However we have to dealwith a position in which costs in the gas and electricity industries haveincreased, and have to be financed.    If they are not paid by theconsumer, they will in effect have to be paid for by the taxpayer.    the sums in question are equal to about Id, on the standard rate of incometax, but proportionately greater fiscal action might be needed to contain the pressure of demand.    To switch the burden in this way from theconsumer to the taxpayer would run directly counter to the efforts whichwe are seeking to achieve in our strategy for public expenditure andtaxation,1
5.       I propose to my colleagues an alternative and, I believe s morecost-effective, line of action than across-the-board reductions orarbitrary ceilings on the increases.a. Firstly, we should allow the proposals to go to theElectricity Consultative Council, publicly reserving theGovernments position.    Meanwhile we should encourage the Electricity Council and Boards to shade the highestdomestic increases and to discuss this with the consumerconsultative councils.    The Minister for Industry has already made this proposal-, and I agree with him.    I believe that thehighest increases mentioned (25 per cent to 30 per cent) couldbe lopped for relatively small loss of revenue.    I do notbelieve that politically we are going to save much odium by reductions across the board from 23-17 per cent to 15 per cent.b. Secondly I propose that we should help those most in needby direct subsidy.    The Secretary of State has set forth in his paper the various considerations which bear on this problem ofmitigation.    It is in my view essential that some mitigationshould be provided this winter.    I accept that the solutionsdiscussed in paragraphs 8 b. and c. of his paper areimpracticable, and that we must be careful, in consideringschemes of early mitigation, not to encourage selective claims for special increases in specific elements in supplementary benefits between upratings.    I also accept that preparationshould go ahead for the introduction of the supplementary benefits Commission^ (SBC) recalculation scheme by themiddle of next year.c. I hope, however, that on this understanding he will find it practicable to introduce, this winter, lump sum payments onthe lines mentioned in paragraph 8 a of his paper.    It might thus be possible to present the immediate mitigation not as aresponse to the gas and electricity price increases, but in anticipation of the SBC scheme.    1  this were possible, I wouldnot expect the Secretary of State to absorb the cost of the initiallump sums, and I would be content that the cost of the SBCscheme should be absorbed within the Department of health and Social Security&apos;s agreed expenditure ceilings only partially,in the next two or three years and only in full in, say, 1974-75.M\f treasury Chambers SWl18 November 3,9702
