HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S government cp(70) 122 COPY NO31 December 1970CABINETSALE OF ARMS TO SOUTH africa note by the Prime minister circulate studies by two official &quot;Working Parties set up inaccordance with my instructions.    The first considers proposals whichwe might put forward during the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;Conference at Singapore for discussions on defence problems in theIndian Ocean.    The second examines contingency plans fox&quot; the protectionof our interests if some members of the Commonwealth break away afterthe Singapore Conference and perhaps take retaliatory action against us.2.     These reports are being considered in detail by the Defence and oversea Policy Committee at its meeting on 4 January.9 OE H10 Downing Street SWl31 December 1970
DEFENCE PROBLEMS IN THE INDIAN OCEANPreliminary Report by Official Working PartyWe were instructed in the Prime Minister&apos;s minute of 30 November to study theproposal that, in the context of the announcement at the meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers at Singapore next month of a decision to supply to South Africacertain limited categories of arms for maritime defence, the commonwealth countries most directly concerned should be invited to join with us in a study^of the political and military threat to the Indian Ocean area as a whole andof the problems involved in its defence.     As a first step, we were asked toproduce a preliminary report in sufficient time for it to be used as a basis for discussions in Singapore.2.     Although we have confined our study mainly to the Indian Ocean areaproper, we thought it right to bear in mind that the shipping routes round the cape terminate in Western Europe and that the NATO sea area has at present asouthern limit in the Atlantic Ocean at the Tropic of Cancer.     There aretherefore countries on the west coast of Africa whose forces and facilities are relevant to the problem.3.     In this preliminary report we seek first to establish on what evidentcommunity of interest proposals for a conference might be based.     We thereforefirst summarise the Soviet and Cliinooo thro,-.t in the r.rc\, both to our own interests and to those of indigenous countries (paragraphs 4 to 11).    We then consider how the situation would change in consequence of the decision to sellarms to the South African Government (paragraphs 12 and 13), the possibleattendance at a multilateral conference (paragraph 14), the agenda (paragraph 15)and the merits of approaching a conference by way of a series of bilateral discussions (paragraph 16).The Soviet and Chinese Threat4.    An assessment of the Soviet and Chinese threat to ourselves and toother Western interests follows from an analysis of the objectives of soviet and Chinese foreign polios?-.     Subject to the primary need to maintain and increase the security of the Soviet Union and of areas regarded as vital1
to the defence of Soviet territory, Soviet foreign policy pursues the followingbroad objectives -a. to weaken the West;b. to contain and reduce Chinese influence;c. to further the general expansion of Soviet influence and to secure for itself the maximum range of military and political options.The Soviet Union wishes to avoid a direct confrontation with the United States,but, subject to this constraint pursues an opportunist policy, using a variety of methods.     The Russians are acquisitive of power for its own sake, to enablethem to have their views taken into account in the resolution of all importantinternational questions and to equal the United States in all respects as asuper power.     In the Indian Ocean it appears that they are improving theirstrategic position vis-a-vis the West while also feeling their way towards arooreation for themselves of britain&apos;s former dominance.     It is clear that theexpansion of Soviet influence is most often at the expense of Western interests.The Soviet naval presence constitutes a growing military threat to shipping onsea routes vital to Western Europe and could in the long run influence thepolitical and economic situation in the area as British naval forces once did.5.     In accordance with the policy described above, the Soviet Union has fora long time sought to extend its influence in the Indian sub-continent and more recently in East Africa.     It is only since the spring of 1968 that it hassupported these efforts by a naval presence in the Indian Ocean,    Apart fromthe naval presence and the flag-showing visits by naval ships to a largenumber of ports in the area, Soviet activities have taken such forms asextensive economic and military aid, fishery agreements with a number of countries, assistance with port works, diplomatic activity etc.     The Sovieteffort is apparently still expanding and it is not yet possible to say how much further it will grow, but it is probably a permanent feature.     The ability to deploy ships in the Indian Ocean would be enhanced considerably by the reopening of the Suez Canal.     The Russians are unlikely to be inhibited from exploitingopportunities to increase their influence, in the same way that they did in theMediterranean, particularly as thejr appear to have abandoned their &quot;no foreignbases&quot; policy.     They have probably recognised, and are prepared to accept,the potential risk to themselves and the danger of escalation inherent in suchactivity.2 v
6.      Chinese foreign policy is primarily directed towards the assurance of China1o own security, the recovery of certain adjacent territories andthe establishment of Chinese dominance in Asia.     Beyond that however itseeks the replacement of Soviet by Chinese influence within the worldCommunist movement and the replacement of Western and Soviet influence byChinese influence within the third world.     The Chinese will seek toextend thoir influence by a variety of methods including both conventionaldiplomacy and aid and assistance to revolutionary movements.     TheChinese may be less attached to maintaining the present status quo and seegreater value in general disorder than the Soviet Union.     Chineseactivities in the area have been on a much smaller scale than those of theRussians and their military capability has been limited to countriesbordering China..     They would be unable to maintain a naval presence inthe Indian Ocean for several years at least.     However, as they acquire a strategic nuclear capability in the latter half of the 1970s, following theRussian example, they may become bolder.     Any increase in Chineseinfluence in the Indian Ocean   area would to a certain extent be at theexpense of Western, including United Kingdom, interests and also of actual or potential Soviet interests.7.     The Soviet expansion in the Indian Ocean area is thus well documented.The military aspect of it has, on the whole emerged some time after&quot;political&quot; penetration in the shape of aid projects, cultural and educational initiatives and arms sales.     As yet, the Chinese threat haslittle or no military content,     Soviet imperialism, if unchecked, could in time alter the political (and perhaps the econonic) character of thearea profoundly and to our disadvantage.     At the same time, an active andpowerful Soviet fleet would be in a position to cut off a significant partof our supply of oil and other raw materials,8,     Although Russia and China each present a separate threat to UnitedKingdom interests, there is now and will continue to be a complex pattern of interaction between the operations of the two countries.     It isdifficult to foresee how this will affect United Kingdom interests, butit is possible that it may eventually lead to a situation which could be turned to our advantage.     Whatever the long term outcome, wo believe thatof the two, Russia will pose much the greater threat in the immediate and foreseeable future,3
9.     We examine in Annex A the Russian and Chinese threats to thecountries in the Indian Ocean in a country-by-country analysis.The littoral countries themselves fall into identifiable geographicalcategories.     Those in Australasia depend to a large extent upon tradewith the West and could be threatened in a comparable way to ourselves.Malaysia and Singapore could be similarly, though less, affected.     Indiaand Pakistan have close relations with Russia and China respectively andare perhaps more vulnerable to political than to military or economic pressure.     The East African countries have already been extensivelypenetrated (though to varying degrees) by Soviet and Chinese influence.Their trade with Western Europe (especially with Britain) is important tothem economically and so in that respect they are vulnerable to navalinterference.     At the sane tine, they have been and are being subjected to political pressure, both legitimate aad through caiT^CTsion.10.   Although Annex A shows that there are potential Soviet and Chinesethreats to the foreign trade of nany of these countries and to their internal security, most will not be in a frame of mind to recognise the dangers.     The countries of the sub-continent profess to see the indian ocean as free of great power influence.     The level of -Russian naval forces present at the moment are unlikely to shako this composure(though if these forces increased significantly, our arguments nightcarry more weight).     As to the risks of subversion, all the Governmentsof the countries mentioned are friendly towards the Eastern bloc (norefriendly in many cases than they are to the West);   and it is unlikelythat they will   fear being overthrown while they continue to adopt thisposture.     Malaysia, Singapore and   Kenya are exceptions, but all thesemake efforts to maintain good relations with the Russians at least (theoccasional ejection of diplomats notwithstanding).     The trend is towardsbridge building between the Soviet bloc and the Governments of thosecountries, not tho reverse.4
come&quot; D BTT11.   It is hard, therefore, to foresee much willingness on the part of thelittoral countries (with the exception, perhaps, of our partners in the prospective Five-Power Per Eastern Defence Arrangement and Kenya) to accept that they have a common interest with ourselves in resisting Russian and chinese expansion.    IShatever the real community of interest, its credibilityto the rest of the Commonwealth, and their willingness to recognise it willbe very much less;   and there will be many arguments (eg individualGovernments1 underlying nervousness of the Soviet Union or China) whichcould only be used in private.     Many of the arguments we would wish to deploy publicly will seem unconvincing to our audience eg many of theCommonwealth countries attach much less weight than v/e do to East/Westtensions;   they feel themselves under no threat from the Soviet Union;they receive considerable economic aid from the Russians and see the soviet union as contributing to stability in the area rather than the reverse.If they were to concede a potential Soviet (or Chinese) threat they wouldargue that they could look after themselves, or that Soviet activities willbe restrained by unwillingness to provoke confrontation with the UnitedStates,     They will point to increased Western activity in the area (DiegoGarcia) as well as Soviet activity and suggest that both are on a par.Those who fear China more than the Soviet Union will be particularly inclined to see the latter as a stabilising influence.     Many will, in any case, seebenefit in Sino/Soviet rivalry as leading to a natural balance of power inthe area.Effect of announcement of decision to sell arms to South Africa    n12.   The immediate effect of the announcement of a decision to supply armswill be to make it less likely that those countries who are opposed to our policy in this matter would be willing to co-operate with us in defencediscussions, since they will take the view that by our action we will havealigned ourselves with a state v/hich they consider to be ideologicallyopposed to their own interests.    We should certainly be broaching theidea of defence discussions in a political climate which is likely to beless propitious than it is now.     On the other hand, proposals to discussdefence matters could of themselves be of value to our interests if theywere accepted, as we think they would be privately if not always publicly,as evidence of our concern with Soviet and Chinese penetration of the area,and might serve to put at least some of the states approached on their guard.-5
13.   In military terras the situation so far as South African capabilityis concerned is not   likely to be radically changed by the decision,provided that she is able to obtain arms from some source.     Whether ornot she received these arms from us it would be in her own interests tomaintain a naval presence in the Cape area in peace or war, with or withoutUnited Kingdom help.     She would in our view succeed, at least to such an extent as to make it more important for the United Kingdom with her limited resources to contribute to other areas than the Cape, observing that shipping is vulnerable over the whole length of the trade routes.     Theadvantages of the arms   sale would be that we would be assured of the use by our own ships of the Simonstown base (which it has been stated^ wouldbe at risk if arms were not supplied) and that we would be able to assureourselves of the South African capability by military co-operation andoxercises.     Without the Simonstown base, and even with limited shorefacilities re-provided nearby (perhaps at Mauritius), the maintenance of a united Kingdom naval presence in the area would require additional resources which could only be provided at the expense of other commitments.     Moreafloat support would in any case be required with a consequent increase in costs.Potential Attenders14.   It will be seen from paragraphs 10 and 11 above that a proposal fora conference or bilateral meetings to consider the Russian and Chinesethreats might fall on stony ground, so far as concerns the countries whoalready have close relations with the Eastern bloc.     With this in mind,it is possible to envisage and categorise the responses.     They would be governed by the way in which the proposal was linked with any announcmentabout the supply of arms by the extent to which it would be possible to persuade Commonwealth countries that there was a defence problem in theIndian Ocean, independent of the decision on arms sales, and by the typeof discussions (whether multilateral or bilateral) offered.     these considerations aside, among those who would probably be willing to attendare Australia and New Zealand and perhaps Malaysia, Singapore, Mauritiusand Malawi (though the last-named could yl&amp;y only the most marginalpart in the proceedings). These countries might reasonably beexpected to adopt a constructive approach, given an appropriate climate*D0P(70) 40, paragraph 10.6
in Singapore.     Other countries who might be in this category given themost favourable turn of events at Singapore are Nigeria, which hasalready expressed interest informally, Ghana and Sierra Leone (these3 countries, though not bordering on the Indian Ocean, come within the framework defined in paragraph 2 above).     Those whose acceptance is unlikely but not wholly improbable are India, Pakistan, Ceylon (whichhave their own policy on the Indian Ocean) and Kenya.     Those most unlikely to accept are Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia though, for reasons which may betactical, Tanzania and Zambia have recently told the Canadians that theywould be &quot;willing to take part in discussions on security in the indian ocean&quot;.     At first sight, it would be an attraction to propose havingobservers from the United States and Western European countries;   thiswould underline the reality of the threat and the United States have themselves expressed an interest.    On the other hand the presence of theUnited States, and to a lesser extent the other countries, would give theforum a &quot;committed&quot; character profoundly discouraging to the &quot;non-aligned&quot;.The Conference Agenda15.   The main purpose which Commonwealth defence discussions could serve,apart from the immediate tactical objective of damping down reactions toa disclosure of our intention to sell arms to South Africa, would be to convince other countries that there is a threat to their interests as wellas our own in Soviet and Chinese encroachments in the Indian Ocean area.We would at the same time seek to demonstrate to the representatives ofother countries that the military resources which they can at presentcollectively muster (listed at Appendix B) could if effectively co-ordinatedmake a better contribution to the security of the area than they do atpresent.     It would be important, in the interests of avoiding potentiallyembarrassing requests for military aid in various forms as a result of a successful conference, to lay stress on the importance of military co-operation as a means of making the best use of resources.    Equally, wewould want to avoid a situation in which we encouraged pressure on us toaccept new defence commitments.    W]e should clearly need to place a gooddeal of emphasis on the subversive threat though we would need to treadcarefully to avoid provoking pressing demands for more economic aid tohelp counter the threat.7
Assuming that enough potential attenders were receptive to the proposal,a possible agenda might be -a. The political and military threat to the security of the area,b. The co-ordination of defence activities particularly in thenaval sphere to meet the threat (discussing as appropriate theadditional facilities, listed at Annex C, in which we might be interested).The form of discussions proposed16.   Reactions to the proposal will inevitably be influenced by its timing and relationship to the disclosure of our intentions about South Africanarms.   As between the 2 extreme possibilities, of a publicised Conference andentirely secret bilateral discussions, the first might have the advantage in terms of public impact (if the aims of the participants were in sympathy with our own) whereas the second would be more likely to yield practicalresults,   it would probably be to our advantage to accept whatever form oftalks appeared likely, on the basis of preliminary informal discussions onthe margin of the Singapore conference, to attract most support.   As an opening bid on our part, however, the best approach may be to offerbilateral talks with interested parties as an alternative, or as a preliminary, to a full-scale conference.   Bilateral talks might have thefollowing attractions -a. For the &quot;non-aligned&quot; members, they would avoid any publicexpression of fears about Russia and China; and, in practice, theymight be a better forum in which to convince countries like Malaysia,Singapore and Kenya of the extent of the danger; they would not afford a platform in which countries like India and Ceylon could publicisetheir ideas about a &quot;neutral&quot; Indian Ocean;b. They are likely to provide us with the best opportunity of promoting a wider understanding of the threat and possible countermeasures;c. Suggestions that our exposition of the dangers ought logically torequire us to shoulder new militarjr and aid commitments could be resisted with less difficulty in bilateral talks,d. They would also make it easier to bring United States and WestEuropean representatives into the discussions in appropriate cases.The considerations set out above suggest that the balance of advantage to us would lie in bilateral talks rather than in multilateral discussion;nevertheless we accept that the choice should be determined by the courseof discussion of related subjects at the Conference and by the reaction to the corridor discussions mentioned above.Cabinet Office23 December 1970 8secret
ANNEX AAustralia and New -ZealandBoth Australia and New Zealand have a vital interest in preserving their trade and sea routes particularly with Britain and Europe, and areacutely sensitive to any threat fron whatever source to the security ofthese routes; whether this results fron Russian activity or fron disorder in areas in close proximity to their sea communications.   The total valueof trade to both countries (exports and imports) is of the order of 54,681 million annually, the bulk of which is carried on these routes.Our new proposals for five poxver defence arrangements in South East Asiahave been warmly welcomed by Australia and New Zealand.   This attitudecan be seen as a reflection of their acute awareness of the need for a secure and stable defence system in order to protect their vital interests.The governments of both countries but Australia particularly, thereforeregard the military presence of the Russians in the Indian Ocean or in thenorth as being inimical to their defence interests.   The Australianintention to develop naval facilities at Cockburn Sound is an indication of their particular concern with the security of the Inaian Ocean area.However, the Australians and New Zealanders would be reluctant to find themselves committed to a position in which they were left virtually alone in supporting a British initiative.SingaporeLee Kuan Yew regards current Soviet interest in the Indian Ocean andsurrounding areas, and consequently their growing naval presence there,as a present and quite natural fact of life which it would be unrealisticfor anyone to attempt to deny or resist.   He believes that the balance of security in South-East Asia will be strengthened by allowing severalgreat powers to exercise their influence there, rather than by dividing the region up into separate but competing spheres of influence.   He claims to be well aware of the security and possible strategic dangers of theSoviet presence, but he is confident that he can z^eraain master of thesituation in his own country.   He would not, however, wish to let Sovietinfluence become so strong that it would threaten Singapore&apos;s commitment to the present concept of the Five-Power defence.Singapore depends for her existence on international trade and mustmaximise the advantage from her geographical position as a centre of communications.   Lee is ready to encourage Soviet merchant shipping interests which bring commercial benefit to Singapore, even to the extent of havingset up a Singapore/Soviet shipping agency.   Singapore1s total import and
export trade amounts to about  1,500 million.    This is potentially at risk but Singapore would be unlikely to admit that their prosperity wouldho threatened by the Russians.   Me do not always agree with Lee&apos;s estimates of Soviet behaviour.   We have recently remonstrated with him over his proposal   to allow repair facilities for Soviet vessels in Singapore whichcould impede five-power operations in her defence.Singapore is more vulnerable to Chinese influence than Soviet influence.In certain circumstances, the Singaporeans would see the Russians asexercising a valuable counterweight to the communist Chinese.MalaysiaThe Malaysians have been concerned about the growth of Soviet influence in the Indian Ocean.   They are now trying to improve their non-aligned imagehy showing&apos;a more forthcoming attitude to the USSR, and they would not therefore wish to be seen to be associated with moves to oppose theextension of Soviet influence into areas where western influence is declining.   At the same time they would not wish to do anjrthing which wouldbe incompatible with their present commitment to the five-power defencearrangement s.Malaysia&apos;s trade with the USSR is growing.   This is largely due to increasedRussian purchase of rubber, and Malaysian imports of Russian goods are much less than their exports to the USSR.   Malaysia&apos;s total external trade isworth nearly  1,200 million.   Most of this could be at risk if the soviet union wished to take hostile action.The Malaysian attitude to Soviet influence in Malaysia, has to be seen inthe context of their own internal racial problems.   Soviet interest atpresent is naturally directed to the Malay community rather than to theChinese community (which should he a cause for alarm).   On the other hand,it may suit the Malaysian Government for internal reasons to appear to bemore forthcoming towards communist China than they have been hitherto.india the Indian Government has on many occasions expressed its hostility to theestablishment of foreign naval bases in the Indian Ocean,   It supported the declaration of the Non-Aligned Conference in Lusake in September 1970,
&quot;calling on all States to consider and respect the Indian Oceanas a zone of peace, from which Groat Power rivalries and competition,as well as hases conceived in the context of such rivalries andcompetition, either Army, Navy or Air Force &quot;bases, arc excluded&quot;.The Minister of External Affairs reaffirmed India&apos;s adherence to this declaration in the Indian Parliament on 19 November.The Indians are aware of increased Soviet naval activity and have expressed concern at (unfounded) reports of Russian interest in ports in Pakistan.But, it is the firm and frequently repeated view of the Indian Governmentthat the Russians will not start playing an active naval role in theIndian Ocean unless Britain or the United States provoke them into doing so.   The Indians reject the contention that there is Soviet naval threatin the area or a Western peeition to be defended.   They do not acceptthe thesis that there is a naval &quot;vacuum&quot;.   Thoy assert that the soviet union has no naval bases.They maintain the threat to the peace of the Indian Ocean arises from theBritish and American naval presence rather than the Russian, and haveused this argument in the context of Anglo/United States plans for DiegoGarcia..   As a non-aligned nation enjoying good relations with the soviet union, India does not consider her merchant fleet in any way threatened by the Russians.The Russians are assisting the Indians to build a dockyard at Vishakhapatnanin the Bay-.of Bengal, which is .to -$onuaed  of flOETE&amp;cin/? the-Soviet-built submarines in the Indian navy.   There is some confusion in indian statements about whether it xvill be available for servicing navalships of other nations.   The facilities have, v/e know, been offered tothe UAR.   It seems fair to assume that the facilities will also beavailable to Soviet naval vessels but the argument that to do this would
encourage-Soviet naval activity in the area,.would almost certainlyproduce the retort that there is no intention of permitting theestablishment of a Soviet base and that the facilities would also beavailable to British vessels.     This argument is, of course, specious,but, given the pro-Communist sympathies of Mrs Gandhi&apos;s senior advisers and her own emotional anti-Western attitude, there is no prospect of moving the Indian Government by reasoned argument.PakistanThe Pakistan Government, like the Indian, has at various times supported the view that the Indian Ocean should be a nuclear-free zone and that thegreat powers should not establish bases in the area.   Unlike the Indians,the Government of President Yahya Khan has shown some understanding ofHer majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s position and some interest in the nature of soviet naval activities.   However, the Pakistanis have at no timeacknowledged that those activities constitute a threat.   As they see theposition, the principal threat to the security comes from India.   they therefore view with concern the extent to which the Russians have built up the Indian Armed Forces and Navy, but in recent years have notcriticised the Russians in view of the economic   assistance which they themselves receive from the Soviet Union.   If asked whatsolution they would prefer to the problem of naval balance in the area,the Pakistanis would probably reply (if they acknowledged that theproblem existed) that the answer lay in the provision of assistance by theWestern powers to their own Navy.It is by1no means certain that, following the recent General Elections,the martial law administration will be succeeded by a civilian government,but the probability is that this will happen by June 1971The nature of ^he election results suggests that the successor government
will adopt a more pronounced attitude of non-alignment and it may severPakistani present links with CENTO and SEATO,   Opposition to foreignbases in the Indian Ocean and in particular to Anglo-American facilities is likely to increase.   It is also likely that such a government would beeven less convinced than the present military regime of a community ofinterest with Her Majesty&apos;s Government against any threat from the soviet union,   In view of the close relations between Pakistan and China, thePakistanis see no threat from that quarter, nor, on present indications,would a successor civilian government.Pakistan, like India and Ceylon, has suffered commercially from the closure of the Suez Canal.   But, in view of their strong opposition to Israel, no Pakistani Government is disposed to lay the blame for thecontinued closure of the Canal on the Soviet Union.CeylonAt the Cairo Non-Aligned Conference in 1965 Mrs Bandaranaike initiatedthe proposal that the Indian Ocean should be declared a nuclear-free zone and an area of peace.   She supported the similar declaration made by theLusaka Conference in September this year.   The Ceylon Government have introduced an additional item on &quot;Security in the Indian Ocean&quot; to theAgenda for the forthcoming Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Conference in singapore.   Their attitude is likely to be consistent with their support for the Lusaka declaration and similar to that of the Indian Government.All of Ceylon&apos;s external trade is by sea and she therefore has an interestin maintaining the Indian Ocean sea lanes.The new United Front Government in Ceylon have been seeking more trade andaid from China, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.   We can thereforeexpect more economic penetration by these countries in Ceylon and rivalrybetween China and Russia may well become evident in this sphere.   A newline of credit from the Russians includes the supply of 6 helicopters tothe Ceylon Air Force and training for pilots.   As the military forces in ceylon are ill-equipped we may see further attempts by the communist countries to enter the business of providing equipment,   (it should,however, also be borne in mind that the role of the Ceylon armed forces
is mainly a civilian one of keeping essential services running duringstrikes, anti-smuggling and immigrant control).   Should Chinese influence in Ceylon grow, the Indian Government would view this with concern.MauritiusThe Mauritians have since independence been subjected to a good deal of high pressure Russian salesmanship, for some of which they have fallen.They do not regard Russia as a menace but rather as a possible source ofdesperately needed economic development.   Although the principal threat to his Government is a political movement of frustrated young, andalthough this movement led by extreme left wingers, Sr. S. Ramgooiamwill not see any connection between this and the Russians.   As things are at present he may in fact be right; but the situation is eminentlyexploitable.In presenting our case we should perhaps use Mauritius more as evidenceof the Russian drive in the Indian Ocean than as a target of it, per se.A presence in Mauritius can have little intrinsic value for the Russians;it can only be of value tc them to the extent that it can be used in thepersuit of wider objectives.   From the evidence available at present itseems that the Russian objective in Mauritius is to use the island tofacilitate their naval operations in the Indian Ocean.   For example, theyhave signed a fisheries agreement and have agreed to provide facilitiesfor the Russians to change crews of Soviet fishing vessels.   Thesubversivepotentialities of the new Soviet position are gradually become apparent.ZambiaRecent years have seen.an increase in Zambian links with Russia, Chinaand East European countries.   Contacts cover many fields.   The Yugoslavsespecially are digging themselves in.   Their are building the Kafue Gorgehydro-electric scheme and are associated with the training of the Zambianairforce.   Romania has a license to prospect for oil, there is a tradepact with East Germany.   Zambia has accepted Russian teachers in herschools, and has a number of doctors in the State hospitals.   The railwaylink to Dar-es-Salaam will bring in very large numbers of Chinese to helpconstruct it - some 3*000 are expected.   Zambia condones Russian and chinese support for the freedom fighter organisations based in Zambia.

President Kaunda does not seem to be unduly anxious about Russian/Chineseactivities and other Communist influence in his country.   He is currentlyChairman of the Non-Aligncd Conference and it no doubt suits that positionpo have the influences of both East and West represented in Zambia.Zambia depends for her prospoity on exports mainly of copper    ( m.4-20out of total exports of  mJfiO). Some 85 per cent of total exportspass through Dar-es-Salaam, Beira or Lorenco Marques and thence acrossthe Indian Ocean, eg to Japan or around the Cape to the West,   Some 70 percent of her imports from overseas come in through the same routes.   The mostof the remaining 30 per oent is trade with/Rhodesia and South Africa;   it isZambia&apos;s intention to reduce this, leading to a correspondingly higherincrease in imports from other countries.President Kaunda&apos;s own defence preoccupations are concerned with possibleattacks (ie punitive raids) against Zambian territory by Rhodesian orPortuguese troops (he is harbouring Rhodesian and Angolan plus someMozambique freedom fighters) and in the worst case by the troops of oneor both those countries supported by South African forces.   He is inclined to regard the United Kingdom as less than 100 per cent dependable as a potential protector of Zambia against her white neighbours.   The russians and Chinese are to him rather pale bogies.UgandaUganda sees little or no menace in the Russian presence in the indian ocean or in African countries adjacent to it.   Uganda has from time totime used iron curtain countries for the training fo particular sectors ofher military forces but always on a strictly controlled basis.   TheRussians have given Uganda little cause for anxiety (which is more than canbe said for the Chinese),   Uganda does not therefore see any threat toherself but appears prepared to accept that Britain might calculate thatthere is some potential threat to British interests.As seen from our side the Ugandans are as dependent as Kenya and Tanzaniaon the freedom of shipping in the Indian Ocean (and the Red Sea andSuez Canal when the latter is reopened).   The cotton and coffee shipped
from Uganda to Britain are more important to Uganda as exports than theyare to Britain as imports.   Uganda&apos;s imports from the United Kingdom couldhowever be replaced from elsewhere (but still overseas).   If it isscarcely conceivable that the Russians could intervene militarily againstUganda, Russian influence in the Sudan does not appear to have made theArab Sudanese any less determined to impose their will on the southernSudanese, with whom Uganda has considerable racial affinity and sympathy.KenyaThe Kenyans profess to be unimpressed by the evidence so far adduced of a threat to their sea communications, which are economically vital to them.The Kenyans however view with a certain amount of apprehension the way in which Russian has built up the armed forces of Somalia and apparentlyincreased hor influence in that country.   Somalia is Kenya&apos;s onlypotential military opponent and, if sheer weight of military hardware werethe only criterion, could probably crush Kenya (in fact we think the threat to be a great deal less real than the Kenyans do; not only is it unlikely that the Somalis could successfully deploy .and operate their military equipment - it would appear extremely unwise politically for theRussians to become involved in the military settlement of a territorialdispute in Africa, especially in opposition to such a revered figure as president Kenyatta).The Kenyans have som^ ^xoerience of subversive activities mw -hho -na.rt ofRussian diplomats and certainly      -hhem with suspicion.Our view of the Russian threat to Kenya is possibly on balance less gravethan the Kenyan view of it; where we differ would be on the emphasiswhich we put on the naval threat to communications, of which the Kenyansremain unconvinced, by comparison with the weight Kenya attaches to theRussian/Somali threat.   But Soviet involvement in Somalia is a &quot;bull&quot; point for our side.   And the Kenyans should never be allowed to forget thatour ability to implement the Bamburi Agreement would be weakened if theRussians had an overwhelming naval presence off Kenya.
TanzaniaTanzania does rot see Russia as a menace; President Nyerere is not convinced of any Russian threat in the Indian Ocean to Tanzania oranyone else and he would no doubt say that it is inconceivable that theRussians would make any attempt to overthrow his government (it is justpossible to conceive that the Russians might in fact intervene on president Nyerere&apos;s side if a Chinese backed coup were mounted).   Tanzaniaviews the Russians more in the light of moral supporters in the struggle to liberate Southern Africa than as a danger to that part of Africa which isalready independent.To present our case to the Tanzanians we shall have to rely on demonstratingthe extent to which Russian activity has increased; but our assessment ofthe purpose of this increa.se is bound to differ from theirs and we cannot expect to get them to move any further than to admit that wo ar^ entitledto make our own assessment of the threat to our inters cs (which theylargely do already).Republic of Maldives (not a Commonwealth country)The Maldivians are conscious of their strategic position but, because oftheir isolation and their suspician of foreigners, are unlikely toencourage approaches from any power for facilities in the archipelago.The Maldivian President has said that when this present Agreement with her Majesty&apos;s Government for the use of Gan expires in 1986 it will notbe renewed and no foreign power will he allowed similar facilities on theirsoil.   The Maldivian Government subscribes to a policy of non-alignment buton most matters of foreign policy is haig and ill-informed.It is known that approaches wore made to the Maldivians in 1969 by theSoviet Government to supply military equipment.   This offer was rejected.However, communist influence in the Maldives might be built up throughoffers of aid.   The East Germans are erecting 2 transmitters - for whichgift the Maldivians accorded them recognition.The Maldivians recently closed their Mission in Washington, which alsolooked after their interests at the United Nations (their only other overseas Mission is an Embassy in Colombo) and at the time the Americans
in particular were concerned that Maldivian policy was shifting towardsthe communist countries.   We have ourselves tended to accept theMaldivian1s explanation for the closing of their Mission - namely lackof trained staff and wishing to he seen to pursue a more non-aligned policy.But we recognise that there is a political danger.The Maldivians have a small merchant fleet plying to and from Ceylon, andcountries bordering on the northern and eastern areas of the Indian Ocean.18

ARMS SALES TO SOUTH AFRICAReport by the Working PartySUMMARY OP CONCLUSIONSSECTION IA. Commonwealth ReactionsIt seems certain that Tanzania and Uganda and highly probable that Zambiawill leave the Commonwealth following our announcement of a decision tosell limited categories of arms to South Africa.   Whether the process of withdrawl will go further, either in Africa or beyond will probably dependon the reactions of Kenya and Nigeria, both of whom may be under stronginternal and external pressures.   If either of these withdraws a dominoreaction may follow.   In any event Zambia and Uganda might well take directmeasures against United Kingdom interests, apart from their withdrawal fromthe Commonwealth, and other countries might do the same, albeit in somecases reluctantly, under pressure of African (or Afro-Asian) &quot;solidarity&quot;.B. Implications of withdrawal from the commonwealth in the case of those countries who decide to register disapproval of our action simply by leaving the Commonwealth without making any other hostilemoves, we recommend that whilst we should take no deliberate retaliatory action we should make clear beforehand our intention to do nothing to mitigatthe natural and automatic consequences of withdrawal.   Early legislative action would be required.1
SECTION IIEconomic and financial measures and counter measuresWe know that; a number of countries have considered hostile economic measures,whether or not accompanied by a departure from the Commonwealth.   SomeAfrican countries, in particular, are likely to take action, the results ofwhich might be cumulative and set in hand a chain reaction of far-reachingconsequences.   Non-Commonwealth countries might join in.   It is impossibleto assess with precision the most likely course of events, but there are considerable risks in the following economic fields -a. Countries might withdraw their sterling balances, a risk whichis only partly and temporarily insured against by the BasleAgreements, which expire in September 1971o   Sums up to 500- 600 million could, in the worst case, be involved.b. There could be either expropriation or accelerated nationalisation of British investments, particularly in the militant African countries,delays in or suspension of debt repayments on our aid or ECGD credit,and administrative action to hamper the payment of commercial profitsor dividends to this country.&apos;c. British firms might be excluded from Government contracts inblack African countries and there might be moves for a general boycott of British suppliers.There are other measures which could be taken against us, notably the refusal of landing and overflying rights to British civil aircraft, the refusal of facilities to British merchant ships and interference with our supplies of raw materials.   However, in some cases at least we could takecounter measures which would have a significant effect.Counter measures by BritainNone of the various economic counter measures open to us, including thewithdrawal of aid, would be likely to have any conclusively deterrent effect on the African countries, though they might deter India, pakistan and the Caribbean countries.   Despite our superior economic strength thevery complexity of our economy makes us more vulnerable to measures whichdisrupt the flow of world trade than our prospective antagonists.2
SECTION IIISecurity Risks to British Missions and Communities OverseasThere are very substantial numbers of &quot;belonging&quot; United Kingdom citizens(over 100,000) in those African countries where strong local reactionsmight be expected to our announcement.   There could be local outbreaks of disorder, posing considerable risks to the safety of our diplomatic missions and citizens.   It is not expected that in any of these countrieslaw and order would break down completely but several African governments might well permit or even encourage their citizens to manifest their angerat our policy.   Contingency plans have been made to warn our citizens and give them -advice and assistance in a series of graduated steps according tothe seriousness of the situation.   In addition, last resort Service-assistedcontingency plans for the provision of aircraft, ships and communicationsexist for a number of countries.   For Tanzania, Uganda., Zambia and Kenya .where the largest vulnerable British communities exist) these plans do not envisage evacuation covered if necessary by military protection but military intervention to protect the communities on the spot.   Short of a majordebacle such military intervention now seems politically and militarilyunrealistic.   Military intervention against opposition would risk retaliation against United Kingdom citizens beyond the reach of assistance.There are severe practical limits to the capacity of the Services to assist in view of their limited airlift capacity.   Moreover, the use of military transport aircraft or ships for evacuation presupposes the grant ofoverflying rights by neighbouring countries and the co-operation of local governments.   The resources at present available to the Ministry of defence would in general be inadequate to cover the mounting of a major Serviceprotection operation simultaneously in more than one country in East and central Africa if there were general disturbances.SECTION IVv.AsImmigration Problems and CitizenshipSome African countries might seek to embarrass us by expelling UnitedKingdom passport holders (non-belongers).   We think it is a likely form ofreprisal by Uganda (where there are up to 50,000 of them) and a possible
one by Kenya (up to 100,000) and Zambia (6,000).   If these governmentspursued such action, we would foresee difficulty arising,out of the normalobligation under international law to admit our nationals whenever expelledby another country.   We can envisage no retaliatory steps which would deteror mitigate the consequences of this possible action by African states,although this could not he done very rapidly because of sheer lack of transportation facilities.   However this could have severe consequences forour present policy of controlled immigration.In the event of the withdrawal of any country from the Commonwealth, itscitizens would, when the necessary United Kingdom legislation had beenoompleted, lose their present privileged status as regards entry to theUnited Kingdom and we should be able to deal with them administratively asaliens.SECTION VWe have no defence interests of outstanding importance in CommonwealthAfrica in peacetime and would be unlikely to suffer serious damage fromany actions they chose to take.   On the other hand the Commonwealth african and Asian countries could, by an act of deliberate choice afford facilities to the Soviet Union which could, in the future, seriously impinge on our defence interests in the Indian Ocean area and West Africa.Cabinet Office SW130 December 19704
Report by the Working PartyIn the light of the Prime Minister&apos;s minute M84-/II70 of 7 December 1970 tothe Secretary of the Cabinet we have taken the following as our terms ofreference -&quot;To furnish Ministers with an assessment of the likely reactions of Commonwealth countries, and of the measures which it isproposed to take to discourage Commonwealth Governments fromretaliating against British interests and to mitigate theconsequences of any actions which they may take in consequenceof the sale of limited categories of arms to South Africa formaritime defence.&quot;Although the Prime Ministers minute refers specifically to commonwealth countries we have thought it prudent, when examining possible measures against and counter-measures to defend British interests, to extend thescope of our study to cover such non-Commonwealth countries as are likelyto become involved.STRUCTURE OP THE report we have divided our report into 5 separate sections, each dealing with a specific &quot;area of effect&quot; as follows -SECTION IAn assessment of likely Commonwealth reactions to a British decision tosell arms (part A) with a summary of the more important implications of withdrawl from Commonwealth membership (part B) and a detailed annex(No 1).IISECTION IIA summary of possible economic and financial measures which commonwealth and other countries&apos;might take to damage our interests and the countermeasures open to us, and a detailed annex (No 2) on Aid matters, ,SECTION iii the prospective risks to the safety of United Kingdom Diplomatic missions and Communities overseas and the measures we should take to protect themand a detailed annex (No 3).1
- SECTION iv the consequences in the United Kingdom, as regards citizenship and immigration for tho citizens of any Commonwealth countries which withdraw,and the reciprocal effects on our citizens in such countries and a detailed annex (No 4).SECTION VTho implications for our defence interests of adverse reactions to our decision, particularly from African Commonwealth countries.2
SECTION part ALikely Commonwealth reactions to aBritish decision to sell arms to South AfricaTanzania, Uganda and Zambia aro the militant states most likely to takea lead in retaliatory action.     President Nyerere has made clear his intention of leaving the Commonwealth if Britain sells any arms to south Africa, but has made no threat of any other measures against vis.President Obote stated publicly on 18 December that Uganda would leavethe Commonwealth if Britain sold any arms to South Africa.     There issecret evidence that the Zambians plan to cancel major contracts with british firms if any arms are sold5   moreover President Kaunda has said in his Organisation of African Unity (OAU) capacity that he is in correspondence with other African leaders about economic measures against us.2.     If Tanzania and Uganda left the Commonwealth, Zambia would almost certainly follow suit,    Uganda and Zambia might go on to take actionagainst our economic interests.3.     The critical reactions thereafter would bo those of Nigeria and Kenya.The Nigerians do not want to leave the Commonwealth but are becoming increasingly conscious of their position as the biggest black African stateand are eager to assert their leadership.     President Gowon has made clearNigeria&apos;s emphatic opposition to any salo of arms.     He has not committedhimself publicly to withdrawal from the Commonwealth but has recently toldvisitors fairly flatly that Nigeria would have no choice but to leave if wowere to sell arms.     Secret reports also Indicate a Nigerian belief thatwe should be doing so primarily for the money and that they should act tomako the transaction unprofitable for us.     Both the Nigerians and Zambianshave already hinted at the possibility of removing their Sterling balancesfrom London.4.    Kenya does not. want either to leave the Commonwealth or disrupt her relations with Britain but Kenyan, leaders have recently shown someapprehension about the degree of pressure thoy night be under internallyand externally, to maintain African solidarity.3
5.     If Kenya and/or Nigeria left the Commonwealth, pressures to followsuit are likely to develop in Sierra Loono and, outside Africa, in Guyanaand India,     Mrs Gandhi&apos;s precise intentions aro obscure but thoro is nodoubt of her hostility to any arms sales (one of the few issues on whichthore is broad agreement among Indians of all political persuasions).The Indians are known to be examining the valuo to them of the commonwealth and of their relationship with Britain,     Mrs Gandhi was very quick tojoin with the Africans earlier this year when there wore throats to boycottthe Commonwealth Games.     For domestic political reasons she might welldecide that this i3suo is an ideal one on which to make another demonstration of sympathy and she might join the African militants in a walk out.     IfIndia left the position of Pakistan would be in sono doubt.     The Pakistaniswould take careful account of the political advantages, to them, of remaining in the Commonwealth after India load departed, but there would be veryconsiderable pressure to follow suit, lest Pakistan should lose sympathyamong other Afro-Asians.     If this degree of momentum - were established thonthe pressures of third world emotion could lead. Ghana, the Gambia, Ceylon andTrinidad and Tobago to follow suit;   and this might lead to a generalbreak-up of the Commonwealth.7.     The above assessment is predicated on countries (some of which have probably not yet made up their minds) taking individual decisions.     Thepossibility cannot be excluded of a meeting of the OAU being called in anattempt by the more militant states to concert an agreed and common response to the sale of arms, in both the political and economic fields.     It is against this background that the effort of persuasion will have to bodeployed at Singapore,     Tho first critical point is President Hyerero,sreaction;   the second, whether departures could bo held at Tanzania, Ugandaand Zambia,8,     As regards the &quot;stayers&quot;, again we cannot bo precise, but the positionsaro likely to be as follows.9.     While Canada, Malaysia and most of the remaining African and Caribbeancountries have expressed disapproval of any decision by Britain to sell armsthey appear amenable to the argument that withdrawal from tho Commonwealthis not a justifiable response and can be expected to counsel restraint at singapore.     Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malawi and Fiji are unlikely to raise objections to our policy.
10.    We estimate that&apos;the following seventeen countries would eithersupport us, or would wish to avoid leaving the Commonwealth unless thereare withdrawals on a scalo which would render tho association meaninglessin any case -Australia, Canada, Wow Zealand, Swaziland, Botswana, Lesotho,Mauritius and Malawi;   Singapore and Malaysia;   Jamaica andBarbados;   Malta and Cyprus;   Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa.Part BImplications of Withdrawals11.   Although we hope that further consultation at Singapore will bring morecountries to accept, without violent reaction damaging to the Commonwealthassociation, a decision on our part to sell limited categories of arms to SouthAfrica it is clear from the preceding analysis that we must be prepared for -i.     countries leaving tho Commonwealth in order to show theirdisapproval, yet being ready to maintain with Britain thenormal bilateral rolations they would have with any foreign country;ii.     countries leaving and taking measures to harass us politicallyor economically.     This could be combined with the breaking of diplomatic rolations;iii.     countries staying in the Commonwealth, but talcing measures against us, and perhaps breaking diplomatic relations.12.   It would bo a major political loss to us and our standing in the worldif the Commonwealth broke up or lost so many members as significantly to affect its unique characteristics as a worldwide multi-racial association.Cur immediate aim should be to minimise the number of withdrawals.Concurrently we should try to deter any Commonwealth countries from taking any other action against our interests.     If there is a chain reaction ofwithdrawals and of harassing action against our interests wo must try to arrest it,13.   Our further, longer-term, aim, even if the Commonwealth virtually coasodto exist in its present form, would be to soc that this resulted in theminimum of damage to our interests, to our status in tho world, and our continuing bilateral relationship both with ex-member countries and those
remaining.     It would best servo our long torn interests if our actionswere guided by the principles that we should not encourage an escalatingprocess of actions and counter actions, and that we should leave open theprospect of a return to normal relations with all the countries concernedonce their emotional reaction had dissipated.14.   It follows from this analysisa, that actions against our interests should bo countered firmlybut not provocatively.     Escalation would benefit neither side and might, in the end, hurt us more;b. that, where there is an exercisable option in our treatment of ex-members, we should consider how far it is in our interest,in the context of continuing bilateral relations to make specialexceptions in favour of one country rather than another.     Wedo not have to treat all alike,&apos;15 .  Before considering what action we should take in response to measures designed to harass us politically or economically it is necessary toconsider what action we should take in response to simple withdrawal.     Itcan bo argued that withdrawal is a step taken in disapproval of our policies which in itself could have an adverse effect on our interests, and that weshould accordingly take some action on that ground alone as a warning and possible deterrent to others.     Some of these countries who had stayed inthe Commonwealth might find it difficult to understand - and perhaps tojustify their own membership - if withdrawal seemed to make no difference to our relations with the &quot;dopartors&quot;.     On the other hand it is the essence of the Commonwealth relationship that members aro free to stay orto leave without pressures being brought to boar on them.16.   Wo conclude on balance that -1.     Simple withdrawal from the Commonwealth, unaccompanied by further direct action against our interests is not somethingagainst which we should take specific retaliatory action.
2.     Even simple withdrawal from the Commonwealth entails certainnatural and adverse consequences for the withdrawing countryboth multilatorally and in the context of relations with   theUnited Kingdom and we must make these clear beforehand in orderto deter hasty decisions to withdraw.3*     Though as will be seen later the options open to us are strictly limited we must avoid giving the impression that we will remainpassive in the face of attempts to damage us.17.   At Annex 1 we set out:i,     the consequences which would follow naturally or automaticallyfor any country choosing to withdraw from the Commonwealth;ii.     the consequences which might follow at our discretion;iii. .   the legislative action which must, or can at our discretion,be taken by Britain in the implementation of i. and ii.immediately above,iv.     Certain consular consequences of any withdrawals.18.   The various consequences described in Annex 1 assume sufficientlyfew departures for the Commonwealth to be able to continue as aconvincing association.   If, however, there were to be a large scaledisintegration, leaving a mere rump, the consequences of exclusion from commonwealth bodies, activities, and benefits, would be correspondinglyless significant as a deterrent to the waverers and the benefits of continuing membership less compelling.19.   Eew of the advantages of membership of the Commonwealth which will automatically or naturally be put at risk as a result of withdrawal areof themselves of major significance.   Exclusion from the commonwealth sugar Agreement could have potentially grave effects on the economies of certain Commonwealth countries, but not on those countries who are most likely to leave the Commonwealth.   Cumulatively, however, and particularly for the smaller developing countries, the consequences of exclusion fromthe Commonwealth would amount to a considerable general deterrent bydenying access to wider and more important counsels than their status   ,would normally warrant together with the loss of aid and assistance froma variety of Commonwealth bodies.7
secretSECTION II     ECONOMIC MEASURES AND COUNTEPiffiASUEES20.    There is a clear likelihood that certain governments, particularly in africa, will, in the light of indications given to them at the SingaporeConference of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs intention to supply certain limited arms to South Africa, seek to impose certain economic measures against the United Kingdom-     In this section of the paper we consider -i.    the measures which might be taken hostile to United Kingdomeconomic interests;ii.   the counter measures we might take to protect our interests.Hostile Action21 .    No definite information is available about the precise intentions of governments who may indeed not finally have made up their minds.   ButPresident Kaunda has indicated that he is preparing a report for theOrganisation of African Unity apparently recommending measures to betaken against us.   The Nigerian Government is also known to have been considering possible economic measures.   There is, moreover, a risk thatany initiative by one or more governments might be followed by others.In addition to non-Commonwealth countries in Africa, certain Arab countriesespecially those belonging to the OAU might act against our interests.The various types of measure which may be under consideration are discussed below -a.     Withdrawal of sterling balancesIt is possible that some countries might seek to withdraw their sterling balances from London.     Some of them are known to beconsiddring such a move, and if they acted, or threatened to act,there are a number of other countries in Africa and Asia who might follow suit.     Anything up to  500-600 million could be at risk if achain reaction developed, and a movement of this kind could have an effect on confidence in sterling which might lead to other, dis-equilibrating flows unconnected with the arms issue-    (We understandthat the implications of this possibility, which raises some highlysensitive issues, are st present being considered by theChancellor of the Exchequer, who will be reporting on themseparately, to the Prime Minister.)
b. Expropriation of British investmentsThis if widespread would cause serious loss.     In Black Africa as a whole the value of British investments is some  500 million (including  150 million in oil investment in Nigeria)-.    India, Pakistan and the Caribbean account for another  5-600 million.     The present tendency of African Governments totake majority shareholdings in British undertakings might bo accelerated,though it is not possible to assess the likelihood of this with precision.In certain countries there might be moves towards outright expropriationbut it is most unlikely that all these countries would ta,ke extreme action.Some, eg Guyana, might work in concert with the black Africans but we do notthink the move would spread to India or Pakistan,c. Financial measuresIt is possible that some African countries might find it convenient to use this issue as&apos; a means of suspending or delaying their debt repayments interms of Aid or ECGB liabilities.     However some ingenuity would be requiredto do this without at the same time jeopardising their own credit-worthiness.It soems unlikely that any country would take the extreme step of an outrightrepudiation of its debts.     Administrative and other difficulties might,however, be placed in the way of the remittance of profits and dividends fromBritish undertakings and investments.d. Stoppage of supplies to the United Kingdom of important raw materials(eg, copper and petroleum)This, if seriously attempted, would be likely to cause some temporarydislocation of supplies, especially in the caso of oil if the action were taken in the winter, and probably some increase in price but so long astotal world supplies were not affected (and the countries concerned would wishto keep up their exports to the rest of the world) we should be able tosatisfy our requirements from other sources.     The dislocation of oil supplies would be the greater in its effects if the action taken by the producer country, eg Nigeria or Libya included expropriation   since thiswould lead to a reduction of world supplies for some 3 months or so whileshipping and outlets were J?ound for tire products of the expropriatedcompanies.    British-owned supplies from Nigeria account for about10 per cent of United Kingdom oil imports and British-owned supplies from Libya to 2 per cent or 3 per cent.9
e. Refusal to place contracts with British firmsWe know of some  90 million of major contracts in Zambia and Uganda whichwe should almost certainly lose (though not all of them might come to britain in any case).     Contracts that could be influenced by government action in the rest of Black Africa and the Caribbean would be several timesthis figure.    A boycott on the Arab model is a possibility which the OAUare probably considering.f. Refusal of landing and overflying rights to British airlinesThis would dislocate the pattern of services and seriously affect theprofitability of BOAC and if West Africa were involved might put paid tothe hopes of a viable second force airline.     Refusal of overflying by india, Pakistan and Ceylon would prevent British airlines from using theMiddle East route to the Par East and Australia.g. Closing of ports and refusal of facilities to British ships the East African countries are heavily dependent on British shipping andmight hurt themselves more than us by taking this action.     More widespreaddiscriminatory action against British shipping would have serious conse-quences for our lines since most of the other countries concerned couldmore easily find non-British ships to carry their trade.h. Prohibition of or imposition of penal duties on import of British goodsThis seems an unlikely course of action because It would cause inconvenience and loss to the importing countries, would probably Involve them in somecontravention of GATT and in the case of India and Pakistan would meanbreaking their trade agreements with the United Kingdom to which theyare likely to attach more importance than we do.     Actic   :n this fieldwould be more likely to take the form of a boycott (see 11 e. above).Counter Measures22,     In deciding hove to react to any such measures, or in deciding how to move to deter them, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will wish to bear in mind the extentto which our own response could damage United Kingdom interests as well as thoseof the government against which it is aimed, and provoke a mutually damagingprocess of escalation.     With this latter consideration   in mind it would, wethink, be generally in our interest to confine our retaliatory action to the samefield as that in which action was taken against us.     Possible counter measures are considered below:10
a. Expulsion from the Sterling AreaThis, though it might well he regarded as appropriate if a countrywithdraws its balances from London, is not really very relevant.     Itis certainly not a sanction which could be used as a bargaining counter - in most cases the two &quot;privileges&quot; which the country concerned would lose (access to the London Market, and the absence of UnitedKingdom exchange controls on capital flows from the United Kingdom) areof little real value.b. Denial of Commonwealth preferenceThis would have little practical effect on the African countries, mostof whose important products come in duty-free from all sources.Exclusion from the UNCTAD Preference Scheme which applies only tomanufactured goods would similarly have little practical effect.India and Pakistan would be more seriously affected but we could not put heavier duties on their goods without breaking or terminating theTrade Agreements which stand at 6 months&apos; notice.     If we wanted tohurt Jamaica and Trinidad we could remove the restrictions maintained in their interest on imports of citrus, bananas and cigars from the dollar Area.a.     Refusal of air landing rightsThis would compel the national airlines concerned to substitute callson the Continent, and would cause them some loss, perhaps serious,especially in the case of East African Airways and Air India.     This isa field in which we could retaliate effectively against the exclusion of our airlines from the countries concerned but it would not be in our interest to take this action solely in response to a ban on services in transit to South Africa.d. Withdrawal of British shipping servicesThis would cause substantial inconvenience to the East Africa countriesat some cost to ourselves but would be ineffective and damaging toour interests in other cases.e. Imposition of retaliatory duties on imports from.the countriesconcernedThis would involve us in difficulties with the GATT and in the case ofIndia and Pakistan would be contrary to our Trade Agreements.     If wetry to make the duties hurt the result would probably be to raiseprices here on some essential raw materials and foodstuffs.
f. Restrictions on creditThere are two main possibilities - the denial of normal United Kingdomexport credits, and action with the IBRD or IMF to impugn the credit-worthiness of a country which took hostile economic actionagainst us.   The former would tend to be against our own interestunless it represented a genuine commercial judgment (since thepurpose of export credits is to help our own exporters).   As tothe latter, we could certainly make representations to theinternational institutions, but their effect would probably dependon the extent to which the institutions judged that the actions of which we were complaining constituted a precedent which would endanger other credit transactions,g. AidThis is at first sight a field in which effective retaliationcould be threatened against countries which took serious actionagainst us.   It would in any case be difficult for Ministers todefend the continued use of the tax payers&apos; money for aid to such countries.   Nevertheless the analysis and figures in Annex 2 showthat the United Kingdom as well as the country deprived of aidwould suffer damage,23.   None of the measures discussed in a. to g. above would be likely tohave a conclusively deterrent effect on any of the militant african countries; they could be expected to worry the Indians, Pakistanis and caribbean countries rather more.   If used, they would be stronglyresented and would be liable to set off further action against our interests in the countries affected; 22d. and in some circumstances 22e,would need legislation.   The only countries in which the threat to suspendaid might be conclusive would be the small and poor ones, eg Swaziland andGambia.   But these are the countries least likely to take action against our interests.24.   Although the precise result of measures and counter measures in theeconomic field is inevitably unpredictable, it seems likely that we wouldin the end find that while we had inflicted damage we had ourselvessuffered at least as much, despite our superior economic strength.   this conclusion is a reflection of the fact that the economy of a highly developed country which, like the United Kingdom, is heavily dependent on world trade, is inherently more vulnerable than one which is only beginning to emerge from the stage of a subsistence economy,
SECTION IIISECURITY PROBLEMS (CONSULAR)A.    RISKS TO UNITED KINGDOM DIPLOMATIC missions and COMMUNITIES OVERSEAS25.   An announcement to sell arms to South Africa is likely to give rise toa number of security problems.     The most urgent would arise from the likelihood-hood of demonstrations threatening United Kingdom diplomatic missions and in .some cases resident communities and property in countries overseas.26.   Whilst such demonstrations, eg by students or political Youth movementsagainst United Kingdom diplomatic premises and similar &quot;official&quot; targets,could be fairly widespread, the threat is likely to arise mainly and in itsbroadest form in Africa.   Even there, the degree of risk would vary widelyaccording to the views of individual governments on British policy;   the depth of pan-African feeling and the size and vulnerability of United Kingdomcommunities.     An assessment of the main countries where the more serious problems could arise - Kenya;   Tanzania;   Uganda;   Nigeria;   Ghana;   sierra leone and Zambia - is at Annex 3.27.   In these seven countries alone there are communities of UnitedKingdom citizens (belongers) totalling over 100,000 plus another 175,000to 200,000 non-be]ongers - United Kingdom citizens of Asian origin mainlyconcentrated in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda - who present a special problem dealt with in Section IV below.   No general breakdown of law andorder is expected, though there is in all cases a risk of mass denonstra-tions against the diplomatic mission and British expatriate community,perhaps with some degree of Government complicity at the start, gettingout of hand.   It is considered that the strongest reactions are likely tocome from the Commonwealth East and Central African countries, with Zambiaand Uganda presenting the greatest areas of danger, although there arealso fears of large-scale demonstrations in various parts of Nigeria.Contingency Planning for Protection in Emergencies28.   Por most countries in Africa there are contingency plans for theprotection and possible evaluation of United Kingdom nationals.   these plans are in all cases based on action by and from the High Commission orEmbassy, although their implementation depends generally on the local13
s:a;ayygovernments which are basically responsible for the lives and property ofUnited Kingdom and other non-national communities resident in their territories.     The contingency plans normally provide for the issue ofwarnings or advice in a series of graduated steps according to the seriousness of the situation.     These could be -i.   a general warning, transmitted through Wardens to the community to stay at hone, keep oars off the road, and wait until trouble blowsover;ii. advice if the situation deteriorates to concentrate at safepoints, eg by bringing in to the towns small groups exposed in rural areas;   and. assistance, in the event of further widespread danger, toenable evacuation to take place by nornal commercial neans.29.     In addition, last-resort assistance by the Armed Services is providedfor.     Service-assisted contingency plans for the provision of aircraft,ships and communications exist for a number of countries.     For Kenya,Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia, where the largest vulnerable Britishcommunities are situated, the plans envisage, not evacuation, but military intervention to protect the communities on the spot.    Short of a debacleof Congo dimensions, this last type of intervention now seems politically and militarily unrealistic in view of the likely repercussions.     Also,any form of Service-assisted plan has severe practical limits -a. The Service airlift capacity is itself limited.b. Service-assisted evacuation and protection plans using nilitarytransport, aircraft or ships presuppose the grant of overflying rightsand in certain circumstances landing rights by neighbouring countries and the co-operation of the local government;   but this cannot be counted on.c. Plans for the use of nilitary force to cover a landing orprotect an evacuation point are based on the assunption that thegovernment in question has lost physical control of the country butremains compliant towards the evacuation of United Kingdom citizens.d. Military intervention against opposition, whether to secure andprotect an evacuation point or to restore law and order, raises verydifficult political issues.     It \rould risk retaliation against british subjects beyond the reach of such protection, and perhaps in other African countries also..
e.     Available resources would not cover the mounting of a majorService protection operation simultaneously in more than one countryin East and Central Africa if there were general disturbances.30.   Many of the plans are prepared on the assumption that UK citizenswould secure their safety by moving into a neighbouring country.   In caseswe are now envisaging this might be difficult, eg Kenya and Uganda could be equally inflamed against us.   (One possibility is that trouble in Zambiacould lead to an exodus into Rhodesia, which vie could do nothing to prevent.The regime might well make embarrassing capital out of this).31,   In cases where it is envisaged that Service assistance might become necessary the point should be made that the longer the notice given to theMinistry of Defence the more effective will be their response.   However longnotice inevitably increases the risk of leakage of information,British Diplomatic Missions32.   If serious demonstrations and disturbances were to occur in any country the British High Commission or Embassy would be a primary and major target for attack.   The premises might be destroyed or otherwise made unusable;   andthis would, at the very least, gravely handicap the Mission in co-ordinatingemergency plans for the UK community.   Posts have already secret stand-byradio facilities outside the Office premises for maintaining limitedcommunications with the ECO in such circumstances, as well as local sets forhelping to maintain contact with UK communities.   But despite this, directcommunications would be difficult if not impossible if the Mission&apos;s premiseswere rendered unusable, and it might be necessary to rely on the facilities of another friendly country to maintain contact.&apos;ll33.   British Diplomatic Missions in countries where Communities are.0assessed to be at most risk have already been warned on a contingency basisto look urgently at their emergency plans both for -the safety of persons and property and for the destruction of classified materials.   They havealso been warned to give attention to the possibly increased risks ofkidnapping of staff as a reaction to any strongly resented announcement by her Majesty&apos;s Government.   In most cases, the best and only practicableadvice to &quot;bo givon to local UK. communities is that they should stay put and keep their heads down on receipt of news of any announoemont liable to cause15
strong local reactions.   But in order to give even this minimal protectiveadvice to their communities, British Heads of Mission concerned will need a minimum of two, and in some cases three, days clear notice, with authorityto alert their UK Wardens or other trusted members of the UK community.Recommendations as to aotion required3V   a*     Before any announcement -i.     The Emergency Unit should he discreetly activwt-od in the]?C0 ready to co-ordinate handling of any crisis measures.ii.     It would be advantageous if the prior agreement could beobtained of a friendly Government to assist with communications to and from any of our Posts which is cut off from direct contact.    (The US Government is the most likely to be in aposition to afford this facility in all the Posts where the need is most likely to arise, although other Governments, eg the canadians or the Australians might best be able to help insome capitals where they have Missions.)iii.     In view of the possible scale of Dvaouaticn/protectionmeasures which night bo needed in tho worst case, the JvIOD shouldbe given as such notice as posaiblo of tho requigonont so thatthoy could onsuro availability of chips and aircraft end bring them and personnel to readiness.iv.     UK Heads of Mission in African countries where UK communitiesare at most risk should be given notice, to reach them at least three clear days in advance of any announcement, and discretion to issue warning advice on a contingency basis to trustedwardens and leaders of the UK communities,v,     Y.here necessary, some Governments have already been remindedof their responsibilities for protecting diplomatic staffs etc(eg Zambia in the context of recEnt demonstrations againsta)the Mission&apos;s premises).   If any specific occasion arises, egreferences to likely demonstrations, the Governments concerned should be reminded firmly of their responsibilities if UKMissions and communities are threatened for any reason,16
b.     In the event of disturbances or indioations of theirlikelihood after an announcementvi.     A strong demarche should immediately be made to thecountry concerned calling on it to take all measures todischarge its international responsibilities towards diplomaticstaffs and premises and for the protection of resident communities,vii.     Action at vi, should if necessary be reinforced by enlistingthe help of friendly countries to emphasise these responsibilities to the host government.viii.     Further action - eg the issue of advice on or the authori-sation of help with the evacuation of UK communities - willhave to be decided upon in tho light of events.17
SECTION IVCITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION ASPECTS35.   Considerations affecting Citizenship and Migration which would arise in the event of departures from the Commonwealth are set out in annex 4.   Those most likely to require urgent action are dealt with inthe following paragraphs.United Kingdom Citizens of Asian origin (&apos;hon-belcngerd&apos;)36.   The Annex indicates that a special problem is presented by theUnited Kingdom Citizens of Asian origin in the East African countries who have no other citizenship, estimated to total between 175,000 and200,000.   We have a responsibility for these non-belongers but theyhave not generally been included in evacuation plans (see Part A above)even where evacuation has been regarded as a practicable emergencymeasure, as it has not in East and Central Africa.37&quot;   En view of the numbers involved, any physical threat emerging tothe United Kingdom non-belongers would gravely add to problems of affording protection to the British communities in East and central Africa.     In the case of the non-belongers, however,the risk is less that they might become tho object of the attacks which the United Kingdom belongers could face, than that theireviction could be ordered as a form of reprisal, against the BritishGovernment.Expulsion of United Kingdom passport holders from East Africa38*   Whether or not any of the countries concerned withdraws from theCommonwealth, the expulsion of United Kin.- dcm passport holders of Asiandescent is a likely form of reprisal by Uganda (where there are up to50,000 of them), a possible one by Kenya (up to 100,000) and Zambia(6,000) and a not very likely one by Tanzania (20,000).   It would belikely &apos;to take a considerable time to expel them all - the availability of transport would in itself be a limiting factor - but any large sca-leexpulsions would be greatly in excess of the present authorised annualquota of 1,500 heads of households (6,000 persons when dependants areincluded); and if an appreciable number of them succeeded in getting tothis country our policy of regulating the entry of United Kingdom passport18
holders from East Africa would be of no avail.   India might refuse totake them and renounce the informal Anglo/Indian Agreement of 1968,under which India accepts United Kingdom passport holders from Kenyaon the understanding that they are entitled to come to this country ifthey do not settle in India.39.   One possible course for us would then be to refuse admission to united Kingdom passport holders expelled in these circumstances and continue to direct the airlines and shipping companies who brought themto take them away.   But a country has an obligation under internationallaw and practice to admit its nationals whenever expelled by another country and, consistently with this, the last Government, in the debates on the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill 1968, undertook that if a united Kingdom passport holder was expelled from East Africa, we wouldtake him in.   Moreover, in the circumstances envisaged, the hardship andsuffering involved for the families of those expelled would be so great as to make it almost unthinkable that we would contemplate persistentlyrefusing them admission here.40.   A possible retaliatory step that we could take or threaten wouldbe to refuse admission to citizens of the East African countries concerned who vdshed to come here, for example as visitors or students,or even to deport citizens of those countries who were already here.But the numbers involved would be very small and such action (whichwould require legislation) would be likely to lead to retaliation againstUnited Kingdom belongers in East Africa,41..   In the interests of community relations in this country it wouldbe desirable to mitigate the effects, so far as possible, of a greatlyincreased influx of United Kingdom passport holders of, Asian origin from east Africa.   In these circumstances Ministers would no doubt wish toconsider the possibility of suspending the entry of other commonwealth citizens for employment.   A complete suspension of Commonwealth entry for employment, which could be introduced by administrative action,would reduce Commonwealth immigration by some 4,000 heads of householdsper year, but it might be necessary to make exceptions for certain categories, particularly doctors.   To go further and suspend the admissionof dependants (some 20,000 a year).of Commonwealth citizens alreadysettled here would require legislation, and would be contrary to pledges given by the Government, albeit in very different circumstances fromthose being considered.19
Change of Commonwealth Citizens to Status of Aliens42.   In the event of withdrawals from the Commonwealth it would benecessary to make provision under which the citizens of the withdrawingcountries became aliens in our law.   Until our citizenship legislation is amended citizens of withdrawing countries will have the status inour law of Commonwealth citizens and the Commonwealth Immigrants Actswill continue to apply to then.   When citizens of a departing countrybecome aliens under our law the controls necessary to restrict immigration from that country can be imposed administratively within the framework of the Aliens Orders, or when it is enacted, the new ImmigrationLegislation.20
SECTION VDEFENCE INTERESTS IN PEACETIME43.   Tanzania, Zambia and Uganda could not strike direotly against our vitaldefence facilities tut these countries and others such as India, pakistan and Ceylon could afford facilities to the Soviet Union which would seriously increase the threat to our defence interests in the Indian Ocean.Nor would we have any significant means of retaliation against themin the defence field.      We sould refuse to sell then armsor to train their personnel in the United Kingdom.     But we would not inany case expect them to wish, in future, to buy arms on a considerable scale nor to wish to send personnel to the United Kingdom for training inany numbers and our gesture would carry little or no weight with them.44.   The sale   0f British defence equipment to Commonwealth countries is unlikely to be a significant factor in determining tho attitude of thosecountries towards the United Kingdom in the context of the sale of arms to south Africa since they are already diversifying their sources of arms supply.45.   Kenya could deny us training facilities, overflying and the port ofMombasa.     These ere useful to have as options particularly in the caseof training.    Thoy are not essential but the use of Mombasa isimportant for the Beira Patrol.     In return, we provide some 150 men rromall three Services to help Kenya in the development of her forces.     the sudden withdrawal of this help would be a serious blow to the efficiency of Kenya&apos;s afjmed forces and she would probably also be concerned if sheknew no help would be forthcoming from the United Kingdom in the event of attack frorfL Somalia.     President Kenyatta is known to attach very consi-considerable   importance to the existence of our Memorandum of Understanding andIntent with Kenya.     It would be presentationally difficult for Kenya,however, to allow considerations of this kind to affect her public positionover South Africa.46.   We have a small naval training team in Nigeria and good prospects,provided there is a background of friendly Anglo-Nigerian relations, of re-establishing a close and possibly pre-eminent Service to -Servicerelationship with the Nigerian armed forces.     This could be of greatimportance since Nigeria -now has the largest militaryforces in black Africa.     The withdrawal of United Kingdom co-operation21
would doubtless be regretted by many influential Nigerians but Nigeriafaces no serious external threat and in any case Nigeria will calculatethat she could afford to turn to other sources of help without real risk.By comparison with our concern to keep out the Russians who are poised totake our place, our direct defence interest in Nigeria is negligible.We have little need to use Nigerian ports or airspace.     The usual port forRoyal Navy vessels on the west coast of Africa is Freetown (Sierra Leone).Its loss would be an inconvenience particularly if other West African portswere also to be denied to us, so that the refuelling of our naval vessels had to be done entirely at sea..     We have small training teams in ghana and Malawi and a useful but by no means vital defence relationship could develop between the United Kingdom and Ghana.47.   The main United Kingdom defence interest in Commonwealth countrieslies outside Africa in Malta, Cyprus (and to a lesser extent Mauritius)and in the Par East.     The principal air routes between Cyprus and far east, however, lie over non-Commonwealth territory (Turkey, the persian gulf, Iran, Masirah, Gan).     If at any time we should be denied these routes, we should have reason to regret the loss of any possible alternativeroutes in North and East African countries,     Malta and Cyprus are inward-looking countries with very special relationships with the United kingdom which are likely to withstand the up and downs of political differenceswell enough to sustain our very important defence interests.     There is asufficient degree of mutual advantage in the defence field between theUnited Kingdom and Mauritius and the United Kingdom and Singapore toprotect the United Kingdom defence interest.     Australia and New Zealandare close enough in interest and sentiment for there to be no serious riskof adverse implications for us in the defence field.     We hope the same maybe true of Canada where we expect to have valuable training facilities.Malaysia is a more questionable proposition.     Her co-operation isessential to the success of the five power arrangements in the Far Eastbut cannot be taken for granted.48.   In short, our direct interest inidefence facilities in commonwealth countries most concerned with the arms issue is small and the pressure which we could apply in the defence field correspondingly limited.     our defence interests could, however, suffer greatly from the displacement ofUnited Kingdom by Soviet influence.22
ANNEX 1THE NATURAL OR AUTOMATIC CONSEQUENCES OF SIMPLE withdrawal by leaving the Commonwealth countries would stand to lose benefits in the following areas:Commonwealth Organisations, Committees and CouncilsDepartures would bring exclusion from such bodies asi.   The Commonwealth Secretariat(access to a wide range of political and economic advice and assistance);ii.   The Commonwealth Foundation(access to professional contacts and expertise);iii.   The Commonwealth Parliamentary Associationiv.   The Commonwealth Air Transport Councilv. The Commonwealth Agricultural Bureauxvi. The Commonwealth Economic Consultative council,     There are a host of other scientific, technical and professionalassociations and other societies - in all some 250 Commonwealth bodieshave been identified - whose benefits are at present limited to commonwealth members, though conceivably they might change the rules inthe event of a break-up of the association.Conferences and Ministerial Meetings3.     Departure would bring automatic exclusion from the benefits of participation in regular Ministerial and official exchanges on Finance,Trade, Health, Education and Lav;, etc.Commonwealth Technical Assistance and Aid,Schemes4*     Departure would also bring automatic exclusion from the CommonwealthFund, for Technical Co-operation (due to be expanded at the SingaporeMeeting);   the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan as well asfrom numerous other private and official schemes (mostly centred in :Britain) which are restricted to Commonwealth participation.International Court of Justice and Privy Council^ Appeals5.     Departures from the Commonwealth would affect reservations made byBritain in respect of compulsory jurisdiction of the International Courtof Justice in intra-Commonwealth disputes.1
Appeals to tho Jundicial Committee of the Privy Council would either coaseautomatically or be brought to an end by us or the departing countries.(Fifteen Commonwealth aountries, including 5 Republics, still maintaindirect or indirect links with the Judicial Committee.)       j&apos;03t intra-Commonw-ialth Agreements or Treaties would, as a general rule,subsist despite one party having withdrawn from the Commonwealth. hero ore two Agroononts to lihiei;. iipociclconnidorctions apply -i. The Commonwealth Sugar AgreementExclusion from the benefits of this Agreement would very seriouslydisrupt the economy of those members (eg Mauritius and Barbados) whoare heavily dependent on the guaranteed price and access to the UnitedKingdom market which the Agreement provides.   The Agreement is not anInternational Treaty but an Agreement between Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand sugar suppliea^s in Australia, Barbados, Jamaica, Fiji, Guyana,India, Mauritius, Swaziland, Trinidad, Tanzania, Kenya, Ugcnda cad certainWest Indies Associated States.   It is probably legally binding in domestic law.   It is of indefinite duration, but changes which are not agreed between the parties can be made at the instance of the UnitedKingdom on notice given at a triennial review; three years&apos; notice isrequired as respects Australia and six years&apos; notice in the case ofthe other (developing country) sugar suppliers.   Special provisionsapply if the United Kingdom enters the e.c..   There is doubt whetherthe rights under the Agreement of suppliers from a particular country would terminate if that country left the Commonwealth.   In the caseof South Africa, v/e contended, in 196l, that in view of the general character and objectives of the Agreement, continued participation bythe South African sugar industry and exporters was not compatible with south Africa&apos;s status as a foreign country, and South African sugarsuppliers under the Agreement were phased out thereafter over a periodof years.   If we were to argue (as in the South African precedent)that rights under the Agreement did so terminate, and if the suppliersin the country concerned did not accept that they had ceased to have any entitlement under the Agreement, there could be some risk thatthey would mount a challenge in the courts should we take unilateral action to deprive them of the benefit of the Agreement.   In thesecircumstances we might have to consider whether legislation could been acted terminating their rights or whether our obligations should bebrought to an end within tho procedures of the Agreement.
ii.   The Commonwealth Telegraphs Agreement and the CommonwealthTelecommunications Partnership.The developing countries benefit financially and by technical assistance-    Wi-bhtirawal of these countr-ioo* facilities andco-operation could, however, cause problems for the system which is greatly to the advantage of Britain and otherdeveloped countries.     Special arrangements might be neededwith a withdrawing country.BRITISH OPTIONS  (DISCRETIONARY)7.     In several fields treatment of individual departers would rest with us.     Departers would not be excluded automatically fromi.   Commonwealth preferences(South Africa, Burma and the Republic of Ireland remain on the list)ii.   The Sterling Areaiii.   British aid and technical assistance(including 0-S.A.S. and other schemes)iv.   the operations of the Commonwealth Development CorporationThere are in additionv.   certain special beneficial quota schemes affecting bananas andcitrus fruit (Caribbean countries).Bilateral Agreements8,    Britain is a party to some &quot;engagements&quot; with Commonwealth countries by way of treaty or Memorandum of Understanding (a particular Commonwealthdevice to avoid registration with the United nations) which are essentiallybilateral.      The &quot;understandings&quot; are not legally binding.     our commitments under bilateral engagements are not, as a general rule, interms extinguished by the other party ceasing to be a Commonwealthmember.These &quot;engagements&quot; include Trade, Aid and certain Defence Agreements.9.     Defence undertakings and arrangements including military trainingassistance are dealt with separately later.10.   How far it would be in our interests to use our &quot;options&quot; againstindividual departers who take action against us is discussed under
&quot;Measures and counter-neasures&quot; in Section II.LEGISLATIVE CONSEQUENCES (Action by the United Kingdom)11.   There will be a need to enact legislation without delay if there are widrawals fron the Commonwealth.    A corpus of our statute law applies inrelation to each Commonwealth country.     It will be necessary to makegeneral provision for continuing these existing laws for a period, so thata comprehensive survey can be carried out and a decision reached on the changes which should be made to meet the new situation.     Such a general provision for continuing existing laws would not of course extend to anyparticular legislation in which it might be decided to make immediatechanges (eg laws conferring Commonwealth preference), and it would besubject to any legislation which was enacted during the standstill period(eg new laws about citizenship or immigration).    The length of theperiod would depend upon the complexity of the problems to be resolved;in the case of South Africa   a. period of one year was allowed.1 i iG^ase^e^eaf^fo britain a disadvantage12.   Most of the above automatic and optional consequences of withdrawal canbe shown to be to the disadvantage of the departing country.     In somecases,, because we have been the originator of certain schemes or are themain contributor to them we can determine the degree of disadvantage thedeparting country would incur.     There are, hox^ever, some areas where the automatic consequences may, on balance, be to our own disadvantage, andsome circumstances where departures from the Commonwealth might not be attended by the sort of penalties envisaged above.     Moreover some of the options open to us are unlikely to be usable because they apply only to countries unlikely to leave the Commonwealth.The Monarchy13*   Another factor to-be considered is the effect on The Queen&apos;s positionof withdrawals from the Commonwealth, particularly if these were soextensive as! to put in question the continuance of the Commonwealth inits present form.i.    Her Majesty stands in relation to all Commonwealth countries asHead of the Commonwealth.     This is one of Her titles.     It wasagreed by all member countries in 1949 when India became a Republic.It has been accepted by new members since;4
ii,.  JZerMajwbT-is -also Head of Qt-s-Oe of eleven other Commonwealth .countries.     There -could he problems if any of these&quot;monarchial&quot; eountries chose to leave the Commonwealth.     Somemight move to a republican constitution at the same time, butfor The Queen to continue as Head of State of a non-commonwealth country would produce a new and unprecedented situation.&quot;Expulsion&quot; of Britain14.   This paper deals with withdrawals.   Some ComioimeSf^&apos;2:^e^ have vtalked of &quot;expelling&quot; Britain instead.     This is not a meaningful threat.Constitutionally there is no agreed procedure for expulsion, only for admission or re-admission after a change of constitutional status.   (SouthAfrica withdrew at the point when  it became clear that her application for continuing membership, as a Republic, was not acceptable to a number ofother members.)     Conceivably this situation could be overcome by some newdevice, but agreement on this would require the usual Coramonwealthconsensus.     We should look to our friends to frustrate this.     Nor is itpractical politics.     President Eyerere has said openly that the commonwealth would not be viable without Britain^ and, for all the flamboyant threats,thi3 is accepted.GENERAL CONSULAR IMPLICATIONS OP WITHDRAWAL PROM THE COMMONWEALTH15-   Consular aspects whi*h will require attention, although not calling .for anyurgent decisions, are the following:-i.    In the event of a country leaving the Commonwealth and/orbreaking off relations we should end any( diploma.tic and consularassistance whiAi we give it in third countries, including theissue of visas on its behalf and. protection for its nationals,ii.   High Commissions would become Embassies and Deputy High Commissionswould become Consular posts.     Consular districts would haveformally to be defined and all posts would have to assume fullconsular functions (statutory and non-statutory), includingshipping duties which are at present undertaken on our behalf bythe host Commonwealth governments,iii-    Cessation of the application to the country concerned of thebenefits oonferx&apos;oft und/ar oortain minor legislation (unlessspecific positive action were taken to the contrary).5
iv.   Action to bring an end to representation of the withdrawingcountry on certain British official or quasi-official bodieswhere such representation depends on Commonwealth membership(e.g. representation on the Board of Governors of the CommonwealthInstitute).v.   Expatriate officers employed by a country leaving the commonwealth would no longer be eligible for exemption of tax on payments ofcompensation under section 38(l)(f) of the Finance Act i960.No additional action is required on iii, iv, and v above in the event ofthe withdrawing country also breaking off relations.6
AKKEX 2The table below gitows ourrent &quot;statistics of aid &quot;to Oommcnwealthcountries.   The aid operation which is essentially a longterm one;i is to a great extent a form of enlightened self-interest and united Kingdom commercial interests would tend to suffer in cases whereaid is withdrawn.   Where the United Kingdom is not the major donor,eg in 7/est Africa and Tanzania, the leverage given to us by the possibilityof cutting off aid is in any case limited.   As far as cagJ/fcaLjaid isconcerned, the programmes are at any moment in time at various stages ofcommitment and disbursement.   Where loan agreements had not yet been signed it would be possible to withdraw without difficulty; but whereloan agreements had been entered into and contracts placed they couldonly be broken with consequent waste of taxpayers money and possiblecompensation from the Exchequer for the British contractors affected.Moreover if we repudiated a signed loan agreement we should be invitingcountries to retaliate by repudiating repayment liabilities on old loans.We should be free to withdraw the Te chnical As assistance Officers who are directly employed by the British Government.   They are not however verynumerous and if the result wa.s that they were replaced from other sourcesthere would be adverse consequences for a variety of British interests.go     In Africa some 9,000 British staff are employed by the severalThey serve those governments under direct contracts, but the BritishGovernment meets the cost of supplementing their salaries.   If we with-drew such supplementation we should be in breach of our undertakingsunder the various agreements and the effects might well fall hardest ondecline to recruit further officers under the scheme, in which case theGovernments could either turn elsewhere or else recruit British officers on their own terms.   When we took this action in 1968 in relation to.Tanzania, the Tanzanian Government resorted to both expedients and the damage done to their own development effort does not appear to have beenvery large.   To the extent that British officers are replaced by thoseof other (and possibly unfriendly) donor countries our general influxnoein the recipient country would of course be weakened.govern,:. ribs concerned under the Opvejrsgas Services and the  individuals concerned who might have a claim against us.

ANNEX 3- ARMS SALES TO SOUTH AFRICA.(CONTINGENCY STUDIES)POSSIBLE EFFECT ON UNITED KINGDOM MISSIONS AND communities in CERTAIN POSTSA &quot;brief assessment of the risks to United Kingdom communities and physical interests in the African countries likely to be most affectedby a decision to sell arms is in the following paragraphs.East Africaa. Kenya1.   There are some 28,000 United Kingdom belongers and 90-100,000non-belongers.   The announcement of a decision to go ahead with armssales would almost certainly lead to demonstrations against High Commissionpremises and possibly against the more obvious British business premises.Students and the more disgruntled elements in KANU would probably figureprominently.   Generally speaking the risk to the British community,belongers and non-belongers, is not considered to be very high and theKenyan Security Forces are thought competent enough to contain andcontrol any trouble.   Kenya leaders have recently, however, shown moreconcern than before about the possible extent of popular pressures.There might well be cases of individuals being molested by demonstratorsor other isolated acts of violence against them.   There are unlikely tobe any officially inspired demonstrations.b. Tanzania2.   There are about If,000 United Kingdom belongers and 15-20,000non-belongers.   The general assessment of the situation is the same asthat for Kenya.c. Uganda!3*   There are about 7,000 belongers and 50,000 or more non-belongers.The risk to the British community in Uganda is more substantial thanelsewhere in East Africa.   There would almost certainly be violentdemonstrations (with tacit Government approval) against the high commission premises and these would spill over on to prominent Britishbusiness premises.   There is a distinct danger of violence towardsmembers of the British community: a general and inspired attack on thewhole community is very unlikely but individuals caught in the open by1
the mob would be liable to be attacked and have their cars damaged or destroyed.   The extent of the danger towards the British community and property would depend directly on the Uganda Government.   They havethe means to control the situation but might not use them until they feltthat a sufficient demonstration of public feeling had been given.The non-belongers are unlikely to be in physical danger, but President Obotemight find it convenient to use the occasion to expedite their departure to Britainj and Asian shops (many of which belong to United kingdom citizens) are always at risk at times of public disorder.West Africad.   Nigeriak,   Nigeria has about 16,000 United Kingdom belongers resident invarious parts of the country.   These are concentrated chiefly in Lagosbut are also spread out in the other major towns of tha Federation.Exact figures are not available a3 it is estimated that only about60 per cent of those resident in Nigeria have actually registered.5*   Though the Nigerian government reacted moderately at the start onthe question of arms sales, opinion there has been hardening: and a violent reaction on the part of the population if an announcement ofarms sales to South Africa were made cannot be ruled out.   The nigerian government have, in fact, warned the High Commissioner that they would expect mass demonstrations which they would find difficult to control.These would presumably be directed against -fee offices of theHigh Commission and the outstationed offices of the Deputy High Commissioners.This would probably involve stone throwing, destruction of cars etc.,but would be unlikely to extent to attacks on the homes of members ofthe British community.   British-run eompanies operating in Nigeria(such as United Africa Company or Barclays Bank) could be the object ofsome form of similar but probably moderate violence.   The most violentdemonstrations vould take place in the more politically conscious areas such as Lagos itself.   In considering the extent of any violence it isworth remembering that the government of Nigeria is a military governmentand would not have qualms about quashing denonstrations which it thoughtwere getting out of hand,.  But in view of the warning referred to abovewe cannot assume that they would prevent such demonstrations from takingplace.   They might consider that it was necessary for a certain amount2
of steam to be let off.   It is unlikely that individual Britishsubjects would be harmed but the possibility of extremists gainingcontrol of mobs for sufficient time to make things unpleasant for any-British citizens who are exposed cannot be ruled oute6.   As in other aspects of Nigeria&apos;s reaction to this problem, much would depend on viiat were to happen elsewhere in Africa.   Outbreaks of violence in Nigeria vrould probably follow rather than precede violentdemonstrations in other African countries,e. Ghana7.   The size of the British community in Ghana is about 6-7,000.British commercial interests are largely those shared by other West african countries - Barclays Bank, United Africa Company etc., and are concentrated in Accra, although with a liberal sprinkling of United Kingdom citizens(belongers) scattered throughout the country.8.   If an announcement were made of the sale of arms to South Africa,there would almost certainl  be demonstrations if not actual violence.The latter, however, cannot be ruled out.   So far the Ghana Governmenthas not shown itself especially exercised over this issue, though Dr Busiaand his Foreign Minister have spoken strongly against the proposal in public.f, Sierra Leone9.   There has been considerable internal political unrest in Sierra Leonefollowing the resignation of two Cabinet Ministers after the attemptedformation of a new political party.   The recent coups and political disturb-ances in the country have left a legacy of underlying tension andinstability.   The Government have been the most outspoken of the Y/estAfrican Commonwealth countries in their opposition to the sale of arms to South Africa and have informed Her Majesty&apos;s Government that theywould find it difficult if not impossible to remain in the Commonwealthif sales did take place.   The risk to British property in particularand perhaps to individuals is sufficient to cause some concern.   TheSierra Leone Government would not be averse to letting demonstrationsdevelop in order to distract attention from their internal troubles,with the risk of their getting out of hand.3
10.   In 1968 there were 1,3^0 British citizens in Sierra Leone, morethan half being in Freetown and its vicinity.   The rest are scattered over the country, with two main groups in areas in the North where we:have extensive diamond and iron ore mining interests.   Other Britishinterests include shipping, banking (Barclays DCO may be a particularlyinviting target) and insurance.Central Africag,   Zambia11.   There are about 44,000 belongers at risk in Zambia.   Those in theCopper-belt are particularly vulnerable.   The British High commission has already twice faced unruly demonstrations on this issue.   Thereare extensive British commercial interests.   In the circumstancesenvisaged the possibility of organised attacks against people withwhite faces is a possibility.   President Kaunda has recently assuredexpatriates that they have nothing to fear in Zambia, if they behavethemselves, even if Britain supplies arms to South Africa.   TheHigh Commissioner, however, doubt whether the President could restrainhis party&apos;s hotheads on the Copper-belt sufficiently to ensure this.The High Commission and leading members of the community believe there might be local and sporadic outbursts of anti-white feeling.   this could take unpleasant forms and possibly even be on a sizeable scale.The police cannot be counted on to cope effectively.   They are alreadyseverely stretched because of the high crime rate on the Copper-belt.However much the Central Government in Lusaka wished to preventdisturbances or to control them if and when they started, it would facegreat practical difficulties in enforcing its will and muzzlingintemperate district Governors, particularly if there were more than onelocal outbreak at a time.4
CITIZENSHIPIf a member country decided to leave the Commonwealth the actions which theBritish Government would he obliged to take would include a change in thestatus of the citizens of the other country in relation to British law.We should introduce legislation to strike the name of a country out ofSection l(3) of the British Nationality Act, 1948 and the citizens of thewithdrawing country would thus become aliens (see explanatory note inparagraph 2 below).   We might have to consider the temporary preservation of the rights of citizens of that country having connections with britain to acquire United Kingdom citizenship, and the rights of persons who hadrenounced United Kingdom citizenship in order to retain or acquire thecitizenship of the other country to resume their United Kingdom citizenship.2.     It has been assumed that the exclusion of a withdrawing country from commonwealth treatment under the British Nationality Act and the treatmentof their citizens as aliens would be certain to follow.   This was theprocedure followed in respect of South Africa.   An exception was made inrelation to the Republic of Ireland, when special legislative provisionswere made in Section 2(l) of the Republic of Ireland Act, 1949, to accord&quot;non foreign&quot; treatment under which Irish citizens are treated as though they were Commonwealth citizens.   There are, however, very special reasonsarising from geographical propinquity for this arrangements.   We do notforesee any country withdrawing from the Commonwealth in respect of which special considerations could be advanced warranting similar treatment inthe nationality field.   A withdrawing country would no doubt similarlyamend its own legislation by which special treatment is accorded to commonwealth citizens (including United Kingdom citizens),IMMIGRATIONGeneral3.     The immigration of citizens of other Commonwealth countries is atpresent controlled under the Commonwealth Immigrants Acts, 1962 and I968.Citizens of the Irish Republic are also covered by these Acts but, becauseof the practical difficulties involved, the powers to control movement between the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom are not used.   The1ANNEX 4ARMS SALES TO SOUTH AFRICA (CONTINGENCY PLANNING)CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION QUESTIONS
inmiigration of foreigners is currently controlled under the Aliens Order,If 1953, which would automatically apply to the citizens of any country with-drawing from the Commonwealth as soon as they were deprived of theirCommonwealth status by amendment of the British Nationality Apt,4.     The Government intend shortly to introduce a Bill to give effect totheir declared policy of establishing a new and uniform system of controlover all immigration from overseas.   The main effect of the new legislation will be to regulate the entry of those seeking employment through the issueof work permits to which a time condition will be attached, and renewal ofthose permits will be subject to the applicants remaining in approvedemployment.   However, until the new regulations take effect, probably on1 January, 1972, immigration will continue to be governed by the arrange-ments described in the preceding paragraph.5.     In one important respect the control over Commonwealth immigrants ismore stringent than over aliens in that there is a numerical limit on thenumber of Commonwealth workers who may enter Britain annttally, but none onaliens.   In other respects the aliens controls are stricter;   commonwealth immigrants are at present admitted for settlement free of all restrictions,whereas most aliens are not free of conditions governing their employment and length of stay until after four years&apos; residence.Application of Controla.   Prior to the enactment of fresh legislation,   In Britain the application of the normal aliens control to ex-Commonwealth aliens would not raise any major difficulties in relation tomigrants already here..   It would be consistent with our policies to allowthose who had been admitted for permanent settlement before they lost theirstatus of Commonwealth citizens to remain with no restriction on their employment or length of stay,7.   No problems are foreseen in the case of countries where interest in permanent migration to Britain is minimal - ie much of the Commonwealth andvirtually all foreign countries.   It would, however, be necessary toconsider our controls in relation to future immigration from India, pakistan and the &apos;migrant-exporting&apos; countries in the Caribbean like Jamaica, ifthese countries were to leave the Commonwealth.   Immigration from thesecountries might well rise substantially since their migrants would not besubject to the numerical limit imposed on Commonwealth workers.   If Ministerswished to maintain the present policy of controlling the flow of coloured
immigration, it would be necessary to impose a numerical limit either onall aliens or alternatively on migrants from those ex-Commonwealth countries whose nationals were settling here in greater numbers than we could absorb.Such a limit could be imposed administratively on the issue of work permits.8.   The question of imposing a visa requirement on ex-Commonwealth alienswould need to be considered.   South Africans do not require visas, whereasBurmese, Somalia and citizens of the People&apos;skepublic of the South Yemen do.b.   After new legislation takes effect9.   The control would be effective if a specific limit were imposed on thenumber of work permits issued annually to Commonwealth or ex-commonwealth citizens seeking employment here.   The proposed legislation will enable this condition to be met.Reactions of withdrawing countries10.   As matters now sxand, with certain exceptions (see following paragraph),it seems unlikely that retaliatory action overseas against the impositionof our aliens control would in general go much-beyond a possible demand bythe countries affected that, as in the case of aliens in Britain, UnitedKingdom citizens living locally should register with the police.   In anumber of new Commonwealth countries the control ,over United Kingdom citizensis already very stringent.   In the others, our immigration policies are,generally speaking, of so little direct interest, that it seems unlikelythat the tightening of our controls would in itself provoke retaliatory action against United Kingdom citizens,11.   The countries which might create difficulties for us by retaliatory action on withdrawal are India, Pakistan, and those East African countries(notably Kenya and Uganda) which have large communities of United kingdom citizens of Asian origin resident in them.   In the first!place, India and pakistan might raise barriers against the entry of United Kingdom citizensgenerally, which might affect the employment of British people, and india has already threatened this.   But the second and more considerable risk is that either India or the East African Governments could cause a seriousimmigration problem for us by taking an intransigent line over the positionof the United Kingdom citizens of Asian origin in East Africa,   The indian government on withdrawal, might decline to admit any more of these people to India.   The East African Governments, on withdrawal, might choose &quot;to intensify the pressure on these people under their Africanisation programmes,in which, case the Indian Government again might react by refusing to admitthem to India.   In either situation, there could be an intensification of3secret
pressure by East African Asians (or others) to come to the United kingdom in large numbers, similar to that which preceded the passage of theCommonwealth Immigrants Act 1968, and our efforts to maintain a regulatedflow might be seriously undermined.12.   In theory a similar situation could arise in other parts of theCommonwealth, where there are large communities of &quot;non-belonging&quot; UnitedKingdom citizens with no other citizenship, or with dual citizenship.   Butin practice the risks elsewhere seem slight.   There is no reason to suppose that any large number of these people would need or wish to travel to theUnited Kingdom;   and in many cases they are probably unaware that theypossess United Kingdom citizenship.   The real problem is concentrated in east Africa.13.   The numbers of &quot;non-belonging&quot; United Kingdom citizens in commonwealth countries who are subject to control under the Commonwealth Immigrants Act1968 has been estimated as follows:-United Kingdom citizens of non-British originresident in Commonwealth countries .   United Kingdom citizens with no other citizenshipKenya	90-100,000Uganda	50,000Zambia	6,000Tanzania	20,000Malawi	6,000Singapore	30,000Malaysia	110,000b.   United Kingdom citizens with dual citizenshipMalaysia 1 millionSingapore       No accurate estimate availableTrinidad andTobago 4,000il        Jamaica 3,000Cyprus 4,000United Kingdom Regulations14.   Following a country&apos;s withdrawal from the Commonwealth it would generally be in our interests to arrange for there to be a period of grace./In addition to the amendment of the British Nationality Act, provision would have to be made in the consequential legislation following withdrawal to provide that conditions regarding length of stay and employment imposed
under the Commonwealth Immigrants Acts on students and visitors then in britain would continue to apply as if they were imposed under the AliensOrder.   (This was not done when Aden became independent and left theCommonwealth, because the problem was regarded as being de minimis.   nor was it done when Burma, Somaliland or South Africa left the Commonwealth,because there was no immigration control over Commonwealth citizens at thetime and consequently none of their citizens in the United Kingdom hadconditions attached to their stay.   But the departure in future of commonwealth countries with substantial numbers of citizens here subject toimmigration control and with conditions attached to their stay would presentvery different problems.   If action were not taken to make the conditionscontinue to apply, the immigration control would be seriously weakened.)5
