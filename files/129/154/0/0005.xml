DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(70) 105 COPY NO   5711 November 1970CABINETLm 1FINANCES OF THE MEB.SEY: DOCKS AND HARBOUR board memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. At their meeting on 10 November the Economic Policy committee considered a memorandum by the Minister for Transport Industries(at Annex) concerning the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board,2. Messrs, Binder Hamlyn whom the Board appointed at the requestof the Minister for Transport Industries to investigate their affairs havenow made their interim report.    On the basis of that report the Board arenow engaged in framing a policy to meet the situation.    Meanwhile chargeshave been raised by 25 per cent with a further 20 per cent to come.3.        In the light of the measures proposed by the Board, Binder Hamlyndid not consider that a reduction in the Board^s capital was necessary orjustifiable at present (though this would have to be kept under review),provided that public funds (or guarantees) were made available to meetthe Board*s cash deficiencies of the order of  23 million between now and 1973,    Of that sum  6, 5 million will have to be found on 1 Januarynext.POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION4,        The Economic Policy Committee generally agreed with the viewof the Minister for Transport Industries that it was beyond the realm of practical politics for the Government to do nothing, v/ith the almost certain consequence that the port of Liverpool would close, causingheavy unemployment and wide spread economic damage, both to the region and to our export trade.5, The Committee also agreed with his view that we should not go to the other extreme of complete bailing out as suggested by theBoard.
6.        The course proposed by the Minister for Transport Industries andpreferred by the Committee is a middle one having as its aims immediate and comprehensive changes in the management followed, as soon as a Billpromoted by the Board can be passed, by capital reconstruction with a newconstitution for the Board.    The capital reconstruction would involve the conversion of a substantial part of the Board&apos;s loan capital, including theGovernments existing loans, into equity possibly accompanied by a moratorium on capital and/or interest payments.THE IMMEDIATE CASH PROBLEM7.        There remains the urgent cash problem the Board will face on1 January.    Two possible courses present themselves:V1. Government application to the courts to appoint a receiverof the rates.This would appear to be a hazardous and most uncertain operation and there are no precedents giving clear guidance.2. Provision of cash to meet the Board?s short-term needs.The remaining and admittedly unattractive alternative is for theGovernment to provide loans (amounting to some  5 to  8 million)to meet the board&apos;s cash requirements until their Bill comes intoeffect.    (Under either course loans for capital works, particularly the Seaforth scheme, would need to be provided and we would need to resume payment of port modernisation grants).    Under the Billthese interim loans (as well as new capital loans) would be speciallysecured on the board&apos;s assets and would not be affected by thecapital reconstruction.    The drawbacks to this course are that it involves the immediate provision of cash by the Government andthat the bonds maturing before the Bill is passed would be paid offin full whilst other secured creditors would be adversely affected.Against this there is the important advantage that the Governmentwill be in a position to secure immediate and essential changes in management.8.        The Economic Policy Committee recognised the drawbacks of this latter course and the fact that it involved a greater immediate call on public funds, but took the view that, however distasteful, it must be consideredthe least undesirable of the courses open to the Government.PROPOSED ACTION9.        If my colleagues agree, I propose the following action:-a. The details of the Board*s scheme for capital reconstruction and for reconstitution of the Board should be discussed and settled with them so that drafting of their Bill can proceed urgently.2
b. The Board should be told that meanwhile their functionsmust be exercised through an Executive Committee chosen bythe Government.Co Subject to clear understandings on these points, the board should be told that loans will be forthcoming on the lines inparagraph 7(2) above.d.        An early statement should be made in the House.P w department of fche Environment SW111 November 1970
(secret)FINANCES OE THE MERSEY DOCKS and HARBOUR board memorandum BY THE MINISTER PGR TRANSPORT industries I summarise below the essential conclusions of thismemorandum:-a. BINDER, HAMLYNVS FINDINGSThe Board have received the report of theirconsultants, Binder, Hamlyn, which forecasts revenuesur^lu.ses rising to  2.6 million a year by 1975, ascompared with     previously forecast deficits of theorder of  6.5 million by that date.     Binder, Homlyn saythat theae results do not justify going for a capitalreduction.     They forecast cash deficienciestotalling  23 million between now and 1973.     TheBoard will not be able to raise money on the marketuntil public confidence is restored and have askedfor a Government bridging loan or guarantee,(paras. 7 to 20).b. POSSIBLE COURSES OE ACTION    .I have considered, only to reject as beyondthe realm of practical polities, the idea of allowing the Port of Liverpnni to close - the effects on exports, and on industry and employment in theNorth-west, completely rule this out.     I have alsorejected the possibility of bailing out.     The least objectionable course is for part of the existing capital debt (including a  16 million Governmentloan) to be converted to an &quot;equity&quot; holding.     Iam awaiting a scheme from the Board which would achieve this.     It would require a Private Billin this Session (paras. 21 to 24).c. THE SHORT TERM CASH PROBLEMBut the Board will have a short-term cashdeficiency, mainly arising from the  6.2 million of bonds due for redemption on 1st January beforeSUMMARY
(secthe Bill can become law.     If nothing were done todeal with this cash crisis the Board would he unableto continue trading.     This would amount to closingthe Port (paras 25 and 2G).There are two courses open to the Government.Pirst, to apply to the Courts to appoint a receiverof the rotes or, second, to provide some  5-8 million(as a loan) to meet short-term needs until the Billbecomes law.     The first course is politicallydifficult, could misfire and even on this footingwe would have to take special steps probably bylending money to ensure that funds were provided to pay pensions.     I recommend the second courseeven although it is more costly to the Governmentand gives preference to some bond holders.     loans and grants for capital works would need to heprovided in either case (paras 2? and 28).d. RECONSTRUCTION OP THE board intend   to require substantial .cb.anges inthe constitution of the Board and in seniormanagement.&apos;   e. R EC OMMKNDATI ()NI invite my colleagues to agree that I should inform the Board and make an early announcement(to be agreed with the Chancellor) that I willprovide loans to meet their short term financialliabilities until their Bill comes into effect.background.     On 24th September the Cabinet considered theserious financial situation, of the Mersey Docks and harbour Board.     The issues had previously been consideredby the Committee at their meeting on 21st September (EPC(?0)7th Meeting, item 1),3.     The position then was that the Board were unable inthe light of advice from their financial and legal adviser:;
to proceed with a bond renewal of about  1 million on27th September and proposed to make a public statement to that effect.     To meet immediate commitments theyneededa . 3 million tranche of loan already agreed underthe Harbours Act, 1964.     The Solicitor-General had advised that there was a legal obligation under existingloan agreements to make not only this  3 million advancebut fi.irtb.er advances totalling some  2.5 million.     Inthe light of this advice the Cabinet agree that thesesums under existing loan agreement must be paid.4.     The Cabinet also agreed with my proposal to write to the Board to make it clear that the Government didnot accept any responsibility for the Board&apos;svfinancialliabilities.     My letter and the statement by the board were published on 24th September.5.     They both referred to the fact that the Board withthe advice of their accountants, Binder, Hamlyn and Co.,were working to produce, as a matter of urgency, a plan to ensure the viability of the Board&apos;s undertaking.6.     Since then I have visited Liverpool and have heldmeetings with, the Board, port users, the unions and localauthorities,     1 have left them ln.no doubt that the Porfsproblems can only be solved if all concerned play their part.     J gave them no encouragement to think that theGovernment would provide the Board with an easy way out.BINDER, HAMLYN&apos;S REPORT7.     The Board have now received an interim report fromBinder, Hamlyn and Co. on their financial position.     Thistakes the form of a review of the Board&apos;s financial prospects up to the end of 1975, after taking accountof various steps which the Board proposed to take toimprove their forecast revenue results.     It concludeswith advice about the action the Board should take inrelation to their capital debt and their cashrequirements over the next few years.3.
(secret)8.   The steps proposed by the Board to improve revenue results are broadlya. immediate charges increases, followed by further increases next spring, making a 45&apos;;- increase overall.Further annual increases in charges to meet increased costs and inflation.   In addition a full review of thecharging structure is proposed;b. reductions In staff by streamlining the organisation,eliminating certain jobs and improving productivity.Schemes for voluntary severance of workers will be usedto the fullest possible extent;c   closure of the South Docks (already announced) by august 1972 with consequent operational and maintenancesavings;d. closure of other loss-making facilities, eg MerseyCattle Wharf and Birkenhead Graving dock;e. disposal and sale of uneconomic dock areas and other assets including &quot;lease back&quot; sale of the main office building.   Land sales are expected to raise  10 million;f, rationalisation of ancillary services, including closure of town offices;g, cuts in capital expenditure, except for that requiredfor safety or legal reasons, or where the continued futureof the port is at stake (eg Seaforth).   Also a continuingreview of capital expenditure programmes,9.   Other steps the Board propose are:-a. a strengthened marketing organisation;b. the appointment of a Comptroller of Finance;c. amalgamation of some separate small departments(pilotage, etc);d. appointment of an existing senior official to overseethe rationalisation and modernisation programmes.-if(secret)
(secret)REVISED REVENUE PICTURE10.   On the oasis of the Board&apos;s own traffic and revenueforecasts Binder, Hamlyn estimate that the combined effect ofall these steps will produce the following operating resultsas compared with previous forecasts:- .TABLE 1ESTIMATED REVENUE RESULTS 1970-1975  million1970 1971      1972      1973      1974      1975Deficits as pre-viously forecast (2.647) (4.266) (6.030) (7.354) (6.413) (6.525)$w^y^s as nowforecast (2.323J 0.619     0.221     0.242     2.116     2.64311. These revised forecast revenue results are based on variousassumptions including the following:-a. that losses from strikes will not exceed  1m in 1971and  400,000 a year after that;b. that Port Modernisation Grants will be payable on capital works;c. that Government loans will be available to finance theBoard&apos;s cash requirements at 10$ interest;d. that all costs subject to inflation will increase atT/o per annum, and that these and certain other cost increases will not be completely covered by further chargesincreases;e. that the Seaforth dock scheme will be completed withthe aid of Government loans under the Harbours Act 1964and will open in mid 1971 and that other proposed capitalworks will similarly be financed by Government loans.
12.   It should he noted that Binder, Hamlyn have made it clearthat these forecasts are subject to a very high degree of uncertainty.BINDER, IiAMMN&apos;3 REG6l/2.&apos;iENDJ\TIONS13,   Binder, Hamlyn and Co have also pointed out that against this background the revised surpluses cannot be regarded as satisfactory.   The Board would do little more than break evenin the next three years and the expected surpluses over thefive years provide very little margin in relation to revenue of approximately  42 million and costs, mostly fixed, ofapproximately  40m in 1975.14,   Despite this, they have concluded that the surpluses donot indicate that a reduction in the Board&apos;s capital debt(currently  90 million) would be justifiable at the presenttime though they point out that the situation would have to bekept under continuous review and that the need for a capital reconstruction would have to be reconsidered if the assumptionsunderlying the forecasts were not borne out by events.15.   Nevertheless they consider.it unlikely that the Board willbe able to borrow from institutions or private investors untilpublic confidence has been re-established.   This raises an acuteproblem in relation to the Board&apos;s ca3h flow requirements overthe next few years, where the following additional sums willhave to be borrowed (mainly because of the need to redeem bondsfalling due for repayment):-TABLE 2 - FORECAST ADDITIONAL BORROWING REQUIREMENTS  million January 1971       During 1971   During 1972   During 19736.5 6.773 6.883 2.651These amount to a total of about  23 million.16.   Binder, Hamlyn have recommended the Board to approach theGovernment for loans to cover these requirements, since it isnot practicable to borrow from the market.
(secret)THE BOARD&apos; S INITIAL REACTIONS17,   The Board have written saying that in broad principle they accept all the findings and proposals contained in the Binder,Hamlyn Report.   The Board&apos;s main objectives will be:-a. to restore financial viability;b. to provide a margin for adequate re-investment tomeet future capital needs;c. to meet obligations in respect of borrowed capital and Government loans;d. to meet obligations to pensioners.18.   They consider that a viable position can be achieved ifthe measures proposed are carried out, but they find themselvesin a very difficult position in relation to the bonds due tomature on 1st January 1971 to the extent of  6.2m (these account for the major part of the  6.5 million cash requirement on thatdate referred to in paragraph 15 above) and also to bondssubsequently maturing:-19.   Baring and Co are approaching informally some of thelfiivcr January bondholders about the possibility of a voluntarymoratorium, hut these approaches are not expected to be fruitful.The Board have concluded that they cannot, out of their own resources or with the aid of funds provided by bondholders,port users or local authorities, pay off the  6.2 million due on 1st January 1971 nor the amounts subsequently due.   They have considered two alternative courses of action, both of whichwould involve the Government in making available public funds:-a.   commencing with the bonds falling due on 1st January1971, the Board to offer renewal terms to bondholders, andto invite new money, as each, holding matures, on the  million during 1971&quot;       197219736.8627.7536.8167
understanding that the Government would act as guarantorsfor each issue;b.    the Board to seek a Government bridging loan of 20 million at current rates of interest for, say, seven years, the money to be made available in tranches to meetthe bond redemptions falling due.    By then the Board shouldhave been able to re-establish its credit and raisefinance on the market in its customary manner.20. The Board have proposed that,  in any private legislationintroduced to deal with the situation, they   would include provisions to enable loans to be secured not only on the ratesand dues but on specific assets of the Board, to be made retrospective to the date of introduction of the Bill.   Thiswould be a departure from the traditional practice in relationto the giving of securities by statutory undertakers.POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION21. Before considering, the Board&apos;s proposals for government assistance, we should review the five possible courses (a - ebelow) that are available.    Three of these can be quicklydismissed:-a.    CLOSING THE PORT   If the Board were unable to meet their obligations and nothing were done to assist them,a confused and uncertain situation would rapidly develop.Apart from difficulties over trade credit and cash to paystaff, individual loan creditors would probably commenceproceedings and obfpin judgments for unpaid sums owing tothem.   They could try to levy execution on physical assets and might in some cases succeed.    In such a situationcontinued trading might well be impossible and the portmight have to close.   The effects on trade (especiallyexports), industry and employment on Merseyside, and indeed in the whole of the North-West, puts this coursebeyond the realms of practical politics.
(secret)b. PERMANENT REDUCTION IN THE BOARD&apos;S CAPITAL DEBTAlthough perhaps the most logical course, this appears tobe ruled out in practice by the Binder, Hamlyn recommendation(see paragraph Ik above) that it is not justifiable   atpresent.    In the teeth of this recommendation it would bevirtual, ly impossible for the Board to carry the day inproceedings on a Private Bill.c. BAILING OUT   The proposal by the Board (referred to inparagraph 19 above) that the Government should provide abridging loan of  20 million, or should guarantee bond renewalsis objectionable on a number of grounds:- -i. if the forecast surpluses cannot be used to convince the market to lend money to the Board it is difficultto see how the Government can accept them;ii. the fact is that if the Board are unable to meet their cash requirements (as distinct from being in aposition to forecast improved revenue results in thelong-term) they are to all intents and purposesinsolvent and Binder, Hamlyn&apos;s arguments against animmediate capital reduction are, strictly speaking,unsound;iii. to advance loans or offer guarantees for thispurpose would create an undesirable precedent forother ports or similar undertakings in financial difficulties.   The only argument in favour of government loans or guarantees is that failing to do so will, inthe view of the Bank of England, make it impossible forthe Board, or their successors, to borrow on the market for a very long time.   Moreover the Bank also considerthat other port authorities1 prospects of borrowing onthe market will be seriously prejudiced, thus throwingthem on to the Government for money.9.(secre
(sic ret)22. In my view, the case for maintaining the confidence of themarket in port authority borrowing is outweighed by the essentialneed to demonstrate that the Government is not prepared to bailout ports which have not put their financial affairs on a soundbnsis.   If this view is accepted there remain the following twocourses either of which would require Legislation.    Both ofthese have been discussed by Peat, Warwick, Mitchell &amp; Co, whoare advising, me, with the Board&apos;s advisers.    Both are aimed atreducing the scale of the cash deficiencies forecast by Binder,Hamlyn, although even so, as is explained below, some short-term measures will be required until the Legislation needed to giveeffect to them has been passed.    These remaining two courses are:-d. MORATORIUM ON REPAYMENT OP BONDS   The Board&apos;s bill could provide for a five-year moratorium on repayment ofthe bonds falling due over the next three or four years,but not on the interest payabie, which could be increasedto an appropriate new rate, say 10%, on the redemption date.This would be equivalent to a &quot;compulsory Loan&quot; from thebondhoLders except to the extent that they could sell the bonds for what they could get.    It would involve specialhardship for small bondholders, trustees,etc., who wishedto realise their funds in the period, though it would protect their income.    It would, moreover, not avoid the problem ofrefinancing at the end of the moratorium period if theBoard were still unable to convince the market of theirviability and might therefore only amount to postponing the problem of a capital reconstruction.e. CONVERSION OP PART OF THE CAFITAL DEBT TO AN &quot;EQUITY&quot;BASIS   The Board&apos;s Bill could provide for the conversionof some part of their capital debt (bonds, debentures andthe Government&apos;s loans for capital works) into a form of&quot;equity&quot; holding on which no dlvident would be payable inthe early years.    This wouLd have the broad effect ofeliminating the cash flow deficits over the next few yearsby the combined effect of reducing both the capital repay-ments on bonds and the interest payments (except for bonds10
(secret)maturing before the Bill had been, passed - a point to whichI return below).   It would spread the burden over the wholeof the Board&apos;s secured creditors, including the Government,and thus reduce some of the adverse effects on the bond-holders of the moratorium method.    It would be a form of temporary writing-down of capital which would, however,give all secured creditors a stake in the future revival of the porfs prosperity.23.   Although course e. would mean that Government loans amounting jto some  16m (as well as the  75m of privately-owned debt) wouldbe written down in value, this seems to me to be the least objectionable of all the possible courses open to the Board.24,   The Board and their advisers are working on a scheme whichLukes account of the discussions my advisers have had with them.I expect to have details of the scheme decided upon by the Boardcriy next week.   The Board would prefer that the Governmentbail them out (course c.) but if the Government make it clearthat they are not&quot; prepared to do this then I believe the board would be prepared to introduce private legislation to giveeffect to such, a scheme.   This will still, however, leave themwith the problem of dealing with the short-term cash situation,until the Bill has come into effect.THE SHORT TERM CASH PROBLEM25.   The Board would hope to introduce the Bill before the endof this month.    If this proves impracticable they will have to seek permission for a Late Bill in this Session.    In any eventof course, the Bill could, sot become law in time to deal withthe  6.2 million of bond.&apos;.; due for redemption on 1 January (andfurther bonds totalling just- over  1 million are due by next summer).   The Board will not have cash available out of theirown resources to meet all their cbli, at ions arising in theperiod before the Bill lias come into effect.26.   If nothing were done to deal with this problem, the board would be placed in a situation where they would probably be11
unable &quot;to continue trading alter 1 January 1971.    This would amount 10 closing the port because all the adverse effectsdescribed in paragraph 21a would be precipitated.27.   Something must be done by the Government, therefore, toenable the Board to continue operating until the Bill comes into effect next summer.   There seem to be only two coursesthat are practicable to deal with the short-term problem:-(1)    APPLICATION TO TIL!!,&apos; COURTS TO APPOINT A RECEIVERThe Government, since it is a mortgagee of the board in respect of the loans made under the Harbours Act,would be entitled to make an application for theappointment of a receiver on the ground that theGovernment&apos;s own security was in jeopardy.    The effectof this would be to safeguard the rates as a source ofrevenue, thus allowing day to day trading to continue and the payment of unsecured creditors so far as thiswas necessary for that puz*pose.   The balance of therates would be available for the discharge of all securedcreditors on an equal footing.The advantage of having a receiver appointed wouldbe that the bondholders whose bonds mature in january and at other dates before the Bill comes into effect-would rank equally with other secured creditors, as opposed to their receiving preferential treatment by being paid in full when other creditors were not - inother words, by their being paid more for theirbondholdings than they are in fact really worth.This possible solution has been discussed with the solicitor General and there are serious difficulties:-a.    The appointment of the receiver, whilst itwould probably mean that recovery against theBoard by other creditors could be staved offuntil the Bill became law, might possibly nothave tills effect.   This could require protractedlitigation which might be said to be necessary because of the.Government1s refusal to make funds available.12,CCA     r-ifllilllllllllililllll......Mill
*si8, pHk fO few W 13     &apos;)b. It has been suggested that the legal difficulties might he reduced if the Governmentwere to acquire a holding of each of the other classes of securities issued by the Board.   but certain of these classes of securities are notavailable in the market.   Any acquisition for thispurpose might expose the Government to criticism;and since the acquisition could only be partial itcould not completely secure the legal position.c. It is unlikely that a receiver would beauthorised by the Court to make payments out ofrevenue to the Board&apos;s pensioners, most of whosepensions are not funded.   There is mounting pressure for a Government undertaking that the payment ofpensions by the Board will be ensured.   TheGovernment could clearly noli allow the pensionersto suffer, and special steps would almost certainly have to be taken to provide a Government loan(probably not exceeding half a million pounds) forthis purpose.   There might be some difficulty inreconciling the taking of specific steps to assistpensioners in this way with a refusal to do anything to assist bondholders; some of these are in factcharities and trustees of pension funds, and they also include a considerable number of small holders.d. There might well be some difficulty in ensuring that the Bill made provision for disentangling thereceivership in a clear and tidy.way, if therewere litigation proceeding: at the came time as theBill was passing through Parliament.I am persuaded that, quite apart from the initialpolitical difficulty of justifying the appointment of areceiver, the foregoing difficulties would almost certainly place the Government in a position which would create further political difficulties over a protractedperiod.   We would be quite unable to get over to thepublic why we were taking a course which would appear to
them to be unwarranted and which, i.f it misfired, would leave us to bounce from the extreme of wickedness to theextreme of assihinity,.(2)    PROVISION OP CASH TO MEET THE BOARD&apos;S SHORT-TERMREQUIREMENTThe alternative course is for the Government.tomeet the short-fall (some  5-8 million) in the Board&apos;scash requirements until the Bill comes into effect bymeans of special loans.   In considering this, it has tobe remembered that, once the decision has been taken toensure the continued operation of the port, it would inany case be necessary to make further Harbours Act loans for capital works and resume the payment of grants, inparticular for the Seaforth scheme.     The intention wouldbe that both the fresh capital loans and any loans madeto meet cash deficiencies would be covered by provisions in the Bill which would give special security (seeparagraph 20 above).     The Government is, of course, under no kind of legal obligation to make money available   tothe Board.     Nor would doing so involve the Governmentin any kind of legal liability to other creditors.     Thisis because there could be no question at that stage ofthe money being advanced while the Board&apos;s financial situation was being concealed.It must however, be recognised that if we take thiscourse we will be open to further political argument thatwe should provide more money if things subsequently gowrong on the Mersey, or indeed at any other port.     ButI think that we must accept this risk.The provision of these funds would avoid thenecessity for any specific Government action in respectof pensions.     It would however mean that&quot; the holders ofbonds falling duo in January would have a substantialadvantage over other secured creditors in that theywould be paid off at par. ^ .. A further point that should be mentioned is thatthe other secured creditors could contend that their security
had been placed in jeopardy by the Bill and apply to theCourts for the appointment of a receiver.    For several reasons this is a somewhat remote possibility and I think we shall simply have to accept this risk and deal with itwhen the time comes as appropriate.28. Both possible courses of action to deal with the Board&apos;sshort-term cash problem are open to objections.    But thesecond, of providing the cash necessary to meet the Board&apos;sminimum requirements pending the passage of the Bill seems -although it involves greater expenditure of public finds - tobe the less objectionable of two unpalatable alternatives.It is therefore the one I recommend.    I realise of course,that if the Board&apos;s proposed BiLL were not approved byParliament the Oovernment would inevitably be committed to providing further loans.   But If this is the only alternative to closure of the port it seem a to me to be an inevitableconsequence of the present unfortunate situation, whatevercourse we try to adoptRECONSTRUCTION OF THE BOARD29. I would have no confidence in the ability of the presentBoard to get on with the task ahead and I have already told theChairman and, subsequently the Board, that I would expect themto piece themselves in my hands.    This they have accepted.    Itis essential to remove the present domination by users (ship-owners and shippers), the Board must be smaller and the chairman and a substantial number, probably a majority, of members must,11 think, be appointed by me.    It will probably he necessary toI include representatives of the &quot;equity&quot; holders if that solutionI is adopted.    The Board may surest that a company structure would[be appropriate.    If so, I would expect the Bill to provide forI the Chairman and a number (probably a majority) of directors toI be appointed by me and for other safeguards to protect theI Government &apos;s investment.
30. The Board have said that they would welcome any suggestion from me as regards the constitution of the new board and the existing senior management.    I do not t&apos;inkwe can wait until the Bill is through before makingsubstantial changes, and I am discussing with the Board theimmediate steps needed.JPDepartment for the EnvironmentSW1
