I attach drafts accordingly.COPY NO5DGRForeign and Commonwealth Office SW111 December 1970
UNITED KINGDOM&apos;S PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY&apos;S FINANCIAL AERANG-EMEMSY/ith permission, I wish to make a statement about certain proposals whichI have today tabled in Brussels regarding United Kingdom participation inthe e.c. s financial arrangements in the event of our accession.In brief I have proposed that over the first five years of our membership of the Community our contribution to the Community budget should build upby equal annual steps to a basic key which should lie in the range of 13-15per cent of total contributions.     Thereafter, for a further 3 years, theyear to year changes in our share of contributions should he subject tolimitations on the lines of the limitations the .Six have provided for themselves up to 1978.&apos; ........... . ,We have further proposed that there should be provision to review, ifnecessary, the operation of the financial arrangements in an enlarged community.The House will expect me to explain the significance of these proposalsfor the United Kingdom.   I will try to do so, hut j must first emphasise that any estimates&apos;inevitably depend on a large number of assumptions whichhave to be made about the ways in which the enlarged Community would
develop in the years after we and the other applicant countries had joined.To take just 2 of the most important factors - it is really very difficultto judge what the size of the Community^ budget will he at the end ofthis decade and what share of the total will he devoted to schemes ofagricultural support from which we, with our relatively small and highlyefficient agriculture, cannot expect to he major beneficiaries.It is because of these uncertainties that in the past the Six themselves have in practice reviewed their own arrangements whenever unforeseendevelopments have upset the balance of advantage which previous agreements were expected to produce.    We have therefore proposed to the Six that asuitable review provision should be an essential part of any agreement.Having made clear to the House the inevitable limitations of any estimates,however, I must equally make it clear that we would expect the proposals we have put to the Six to result in our paying substantially more in contributions to the Community budget than we would receive from payments under schemes of Community expenditure,2
For example if we assume that the Community budget in 1977 was to be$4,500 million, as we have suggested to the Cormnunity, then under theproposals v/e have now made, after making an estimate for receipts, our net contribution would build up gradually from about  30 million in 1973 to about 140 million to  180 million in 1977*   If, however, the Community budgeti l./-:::,.;vv^.:V-.-.V....-H,:.,-,.      :-...:,v:-remained at its current level of about $3,000 million then our net contribu-tion would reach about  60 million to  85 million in 1977, on the sameestimated basis of receipts.We have also to take account of the fact that in the short term membership of the Community will have certain other adverse effects on our balance oftrade as a result of the increased cost of food imports and the loss of someIof the trade preferences we enjoy in other markets.    For this reason, it isimportant that we should move up gradually towards our ultimate contribution.Neither this Government nor our predecessors have ever attempted to disguisethe fact that membership of the Community will involve a substantial net contribution to the Community budget and, at least. in the early stages,other balance of payments costs.    But again, like our predecessors, v/ebelieve that account must also be taken of the prospect of dynamic economic3
advantages of membership which would be substantial.    As to these, one hasto make a   judgement about the likely response of British industry to the opportunities and challenges that would be presented by our entry into theCommunity.    The Governoent*s judgement - and it is shared by the over-whelming majority of our leading industrialists - ia that the responsewould be vigorous and determined and that we could expect to achieve asignificantly higher economic growth rate if we joined the Community than if we remained outside.The Government also consider that membership of an enlarged Community willprovide considerable opportunities for British farmers.    Without under-estimating the problems that have to be faced in the early years of our membership, therefore, we hold firmly to the view that our entry into theCommunity on reasonable terms would be in the long-term economic interestsof this country.Y/e are also convinced that enlargement of the Community would be in theinterests, political perhaps even more than economic, of the whole of western Europe.   It is with these considerations in mind that the Governmenthave formulated the proposals which I have tabled in Brussels today.4
DRAFT REPLIES TO SUPPLEMENTARY QUESTIONS1.    Q.    How big would the total balance of payments costs be?A.    As I have already explained, our net contributions to theCommunity budget might gradually build up to a cost of between 60 million to  180 million depending on the size of the budget,I have also referred to the adverse short-term effects on our trade balance;   these might in total amount to between  200 and 300 million ^increased food import bill  90 million:   deterioration in industrial trade balance due to increased food prices leading to reduced competitiveness  75 million and due to tariff changes 80 million7 by the end of the transitional period,     Thus, on one side of the account the total balance of payments costs of membership - which I mhst again stress are highly speculative -might build up to about  250- 500 million in 8 years&apos; time.   Onthe other hand the dynamic benefits of membership would over thisperiod help to strengthen the competitive position of our economy,improve our growth rate and improve our visible trade balance,2,    Q,    How do Her Majesty1s Government propose to meet the costs?A.    We are speaking of the position 8 years hence.   By that time we are confident that, as our policies progressively bear fruit, and aswe complete the payment of our outstanding indebtedness, we shalloaintnin a surplus sufficient to meet our contribution to theCommunity^ budget and other initial costs of membership, and thatwe shall enjoy a more favourable rate of economic growth and a more competitive position in world trade.    As the Rt Hon Member forStechford pointed out in the debate in the House on 25 February,an additional growth rate of -g- per cent per annum would give us an extra  1,100 million per annum after 5 years;   and as he also saidif we are to use our balance of payments surplus as a foundation for greater wealth in the future, we can advantageously invest partof it in the cost of admission to the Community,   He believed, andso do I, that that is more likely to increase our growth rate inthe future than any other course which we could take,
3.     Q.    What about capital movements?A.    It is even more difficult to estimate what capital flows will he8 years hence than to predict trade changes.    The estimates Ihave already provided are, as I have said, very speculative andit would be quite impossible to forecast size and direction ofcapital flows,h*     Q*    What about invisibles?A.    It is also very difficult to forecast the future pattern ofinvisible trade but our membership of the Community will clearlyopen up new opportunities in this field and I am confident thatthe City and our other invisible exporters will seize them.As the Rt Hon Member for Stechford said in the debate in the house on 25 February, &quot;we have the strongest position on invisibleaccount of almost any country in the world.   That ..... strengthwould  undoubtedly be further increased by our accession to the eec&quot;.5.     Q.    Can we. afford to accept the system at the end of the transitional period?A.    The Hon. Member is asking me to speculate about what the situation will be in the 1980s.   It is quite clearly impossible to forecastwhat our position will be either as members of the Community or outside it that far ahead.     That is why we are seeking a reviewprovision.   Much will depend not only on the development of community policies after we have become a member but also on the response to membership of British industry and agriculture.In any case, however, it will not be in the interests of our partners in an enlarged Community that we should shoulder an unacceptable burden on our economy.    This has already been confirmed by what the Six have told me and I can say with confidence that should unacceptable situations arise in an enlarged Community the Community, s survival would demand thatequitable solutions were found.
Why 13-15 per cent?We have based our proposal on a comparison made in 2 differentways of our position with that of tho Federal German Republictaking account of their higher GNP and their higher receipts from the Community budget.     One method gives 13 per cent andthe other 15 per cent.     Germany1s economic structure is perhaps the most comparable to our own.
