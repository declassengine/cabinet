DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(70) 12129 December 1970CABINETSPEAKERrS PENSIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer111. I have considered the pension benefits which should be provided forthe Speaker who has decided to retire early in the New Year.2.        When the preceding Speaker died in office in 1965 provision was madefor a pension of  1,667 a year for his widow.    This followed the principle -first introduced for Mr Speaker Morrison in 1959 - cf providing a v/idow1 pension at the rate of one-third of the Speaker-s own pension which was assumed in 1955 to be  5, COO a year.    The figure of  5S 000 was arrived aton the basis that since the Government applied to the Speaker from1 April 1965, only half the salary increase proposed by the Lawrence report it was reasonable to assume only half the increase proposed in the Reportinths Speaker% pension (the Report proposed an increase from the thentraditional  4, 000 to  6f 000 a year).    The same method was adopted for increasing the pensions of the Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor.3, i      The Speaker 1s salary has remained at  8, 500 since then and i suggest that it would therefore be right to provide a pension of  5, 000 for mr Speaker King and a contingent widowrs pension of  1,667 a year in theevent of his wife surviving him.    The Speakerts salary and pension will nodoubt be considered as part of the forthcoming review of the remuneration of Ministers and Members of Parliament.    Any new level of pension thatmay be established will apply to Speakers retiring thereafter.Mr Speaker King will not automatically be brought up to the new level (thatwould be to apply the principle of parity to him and we have always refusedto increase public service pensions on this basis).    It will, however, bepossible to increase his pension under the Pensions (Increase) legislation,since in accordance with past practice, his pension will come within thescope of the new Pensions (Increase) Bill to be introduced later in thecurrent Session.    This means that, when the Bill has been enacted, we shallhave power from any date after 31 August 1971 to make good the loss in the purchasing power of his pension between 1 April 1965, when the  5, 000 rate was deemed to be established, and 31 March 1971, subject to the practicallimitation that the then current figure for a retiring SpeakerTs pension is notexceeded.    Mr Speaker King*s pension would also be included on this basis in the subsequent biennial reviews of public service pensions for which thePensions (Increase) Bill will make provision,1fJOCOPY NO       0 u
