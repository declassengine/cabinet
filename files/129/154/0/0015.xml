UNITED KINGDOM CONTRIBUTION TO THEBUDGET OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIESNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth AffairsCOPY NOUCABINETI attach for consideration by the Cabinet a report by officialswhich assesses the best terms we are likely to secure on the UnitedKingdom contribution to the Community budget.    Community finance isof course the central issue in the negotiations for eur entry into theCommunity.2.     The report has been considered by the Ministerial Committee onthe Approach to Eurepe, whs consider that it makes a realistic assessment.We think it is now important that we should make a detailed opening bid on community finance before Christmas.    The Community are working hardon their own detailed negotiating position, and if we want our friends in theCommunity to take aur views into account we must put them forward in brussels soon.3.     The Chancellor &amp;f the Duchy of Lancaster will be making a statement in Birussels on 8 December setting the programme against which we canpresent our detailed proposals later this m&amp;nth.   He will recommend orallyto the Cabinet what our opening bid to the Six should be.4.     The negotiation of this crucial question will not be concludedquickly.    There will be ample time to consider further all the issues involved as the negotiations proceed, and as we discover where there is&quot;give&quot; in the Community&apos;s position.    What we have to decide now is ourstarting point for negotiations in this field: we must avoid the risk wf beingtold by the Six at a later stage that their position would have been merefavourable to our interests Itad they known precisely what we wanted.A D-foreign and Commonwealth Office, SWl7 December 1970DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(70) 1157 December 1970
:retCOMIvIUNITY FINANCE - UNITED KINGDOM NEGOTIATING- OBJECTIVES1,    At their meeting on 3 July (AE(70) 1st Meeting, Item 3), the ministerial Committee on the Approach to Europe considered the mainnegotiating brief prepared by officials on Community Finance (AE(70) 4).Sub sequent ly, the Committee agreed (AE(70) 4-th Meeting, Item 2) that weshould table in the negotiations a factual note (AE(70) 15 (Revise)) whichset out our estimate of what the effects would be of applying withoutadjustment in an enlarged Community the financial regulations which the six have agreed among themselves in the context of the existing Community.This note showed that we faced the prospect that, by the end of whatevertransitional period was agreed, we would he making an annual net contribution to the Community&apos;s budget of nearly  470 million(1,125 million units of account).2.    The Six referred our note to the Commission for examination, and atthe meeting of Deputies on 4- November we were given a copy of theCommission&apos;s report.    The Commission made the following main comments on our note:i.    We had tended to over-estimate our own likely contributions to Community funds and to under-estimate those of the Six;ii.     agriculture would soon begin to take up a diminishingproportion of Community expenditure and new schemes for expenditureon, for example, regional policy, and industrial policy would beadopted from which Britain would be a major beneficiary;iii.   it was impossible to predict the future and we, as the Six did,would probably very quickly find after entry into the Community thatour worst expectations turned out to be unjustified as the dynamicbenefits of membership became apparent and our economic growth rateaccelerated;   andiv.    we should in any case have sufficient confidence in theCommunity system to realise that if after v/e became members our contributions to the budget proved to be an entirely unacceptableBurden on our economy, then effective action would be taken todeal with the situation.
3,    In handing the Commissions report over to us, the Six made it clearthat while they had not tried to reach detailed conclusions on it, theyendorsed its general lines and particularly the point summarised inparagraph 2iv above.   We have good reason to &quot;believe, nevertheless, that atleast some of the Six have been impressed by the arguments we presented inour note and reoognise that unmodified application of their existing financialregulations in an enlarged Community would impose very serious economicburdens on us.   We for our part told the Six on 4 November that we havenever maintained that precise and detailed estimates for trade and price levels could be made for a period 8 years in the future, but that we regardedour paper as providing a realistic appraisal of the nature of the difficul-ties facing us.   We added that v/e believed it would be impossible to denythat the financial arrangements of the Community posed an acute and serious problem for us.4.    The Commission have now produced for the Six a &quot;vue d&apos;ensemble&quot; of themain issues in the negotiations, which includes proposals for transitionalmeasures to deal with the problem of Community finance.   These proposals are summarised in paragraph 6 below.   They have not yet been accepted by the Sixwho intend to discuss them thoroughly between themselves before formallytabling any proposals in the negotiations.   We must now re-examine our negotiating position in the light of the Commission^ proposals and prepareto table proposals of our own as soon as possible, as we agreed to do at thelast Ministerial meeting with the Six on 27 October,The main negotiating brief5.    The main negotiating brief (gB(jO) 4 - especially paragraph 81) proposedthat, with the aim of limiting as far as possible our net contributions tothe Community budget and prolonging the period over which they would buildup, we should seek the Six&apos;s agreement to arrangements on the following lines -a.    During the agricultural transitional period (which we now rrecoonendinAE(70) 44   should be 5 years) our contribution to the Community budgetwould increase by annual steps until it reached the so-called &quot;key&quot;contribution, which would apply in the year following the end of the transitional period.   This &quot;key&quot; contribution would be expressed asa percentage of the total Community budget.
SE -RET&quot;b.    Thereafter, for a further 7 years, our contribution would be governed by &quot;correctives&quot; limiting the amount by which our percentagecontribution could rise above our &quot;key&quot; contribution,c.    Towards the end of this total period of 13 years, there would bea review of the financial arrangements of the enlarged Community.The Commissions proposals.    The Commission have assumed that at the end of a 5 year transitional period we would become fully liable to the Six&apos;s existing financialregulations (ie from 1978 we would have to pay 90 per cent of our receipts from agricultural levies and customs duties into the Community budget andwould be liable to make balancing contributions on the basis of the yield of up to 1 per cent of a value added tax.) Their proposals concern only the5 transitional years 1973-77 inclusive.   For this period they suggest thatour contributions should be governed by one Df two alternative formulae:a. Our gross contributions in the first year (assumed to be 1973)would be at a &quot;key&quot; level of about 21.5 per cent of the total budget -a &quot;key&quot; larger than Franco^ but smaller than Germany^ - and for thenext 4- years would be subject to the same &quot;correctives&quot; as those of the six (with the result that by 1977 our &quot;key&quot; would probably have reached22*4 per cont); orb. We should become liable immediately on entry to hand over90 per cent of our levy receipts and a steadily increasing proportionof our receipts from customs duties, but subject to minimum and maximumlimits which would be 10 per cent (minimum) and 15 per cent (maximum)of the total budget in 1973, rising &apos;try equal steps of 2.5 per cent to20 per cent (minimum) and 25 per cent (maximum) in 1977.7.    Of these two alternatives, the second is clearly the more advantageous (or rather the less disadvantageous) from our point of view, as it would almost certainly result in our paying considerably smaller contributions in the first   -3 years and significantly larger contributions only in the fifthjcar.lfcvcti*db3s,our gross contributions under the second alternative would almost certeriiuy roachthe- maximum limits throughout most of tho transitional period, with tho resultthat wo would face the prospect of making net contributions (ic after allowing
for receipts) of about  220 million in respect of XTftxLBins to  365 million inrespect of 1977, if, as we estinate, the Community budget increases from,000 million units of account to 4,500 million ovor this period.   Underboth of the Commission^ alternative schemes there would he no maximum limitset for our gross contributions after 1977? so that in 1978 our netcontributions could be oxpected to rise to the figure of nearly  470 million which we gave in the paper that we presented to the Six in July.   (A table showing in more detail the likely effects on our contributions of the commissions proposals is at Annex A).Provision for a Review37  Thus,&apos; the Connissi on1 s proposals imply that our net contribu-tions to the Connunity budget would rapidly build up to c. very hijhlevel.    There is also one soriouc omission from, thou.     There isno suggestion that before we became subject to the full rigour of theComunity^ existing arrangements there should be a review of our positionin the light of experience.   This is entirely unreasonable.   In commenting on the paper we tabled in July, the Commission pointed out that enlargement of the Community would create &quot;an economic state of affairs which isparticularly complex and fluid&quot; and claimed that as a result it was virtuallyinpossible to predict how the financial arrangenents of the enlargedConnunity would work out in practice.   Nevertheless, the Commission havegiven no indication in presenting their proposals that a review night be needed to examine the working of the financial arrangenents and to modifythen if their results had proved to be clearly inequitable or intolerable.9.    We do not in fact believe that, if at any time it became clear that wewere faced with an unreasonable financial burden, our partners in the enlarged Community would force us into a position where we would simply haveto refuse to pay.   None of the menbers of the existing Community has everboon obliged to accept a Connunity decision which it considered to be contraryto its vital national interests;   in one way or another (for example, bytrading off agrocnent   on one policy against agreement on another) acceptablecompromise solutions have always been found.   Xn the light of tho way the six thon30lvos&quot;have tacklod this sort of problem in the past, therefore, we4
could expect a review to &quot;be held - even if no specific provision had beenmade for one in advance - in the course of which suitable adjustments would&quot;be agreed.   As the Commission pointed out in their comments on our paper,&quot;if ... an an enlarged Community, unacceptable situations should occur, thevery life of the Community would necessitate that the Institutions should find equitable solutions&quot;.10,  Nevertheless, we should insist that a suitable review provision must beincluded in any agreement we make with the Six on financial arrangementsboth because such a provision would help to reassure domestic public opinionthat it would prove possible to keep our contributions to the community budget within reasonable bounds;   and because our hand would be strengthenedin demanding a re-examination of our position even during the early years ofour membership if we could justify such a demand in terms of a reviewprovision forming part of our accession agreement,   He could with advantageadopt the Commission^ own phraseology and propose to the Six that thereshould be provision for a review to. be held -&quot;to find equitable solutions in the event that the burden ofresource transfer placed on any member state of the enlarged community created or threatened to create an unacceptablesituation calling for remedial action in the interests of theCommunity as a whole&quot;.Factors determining the size of the burden11.   Four factors will have a critical influence on tho size of the burden which Community finance arrangements will impose on us during our early years of membership.   These are -i. The length of the period during which our contributions willbe related to a fixed percentage or &quot;key&quot; level (instead of being determined by the Six*s existing arrangements for automatically handing over levy and duty receipts and any balancing VAT contributions needed);together with the pace at which our contributions build up to this&quot;key&quot; level.ii. The size of our &quot;key&quot;.iii. The size of the receipts v/e obtain from Community expenditure.iv. The size and composition of the Community budget.
So far as the first 3 of these factors are concerned, we can try to agreesatisfactory arrangements with the Six in the course of the negotiations put we cannot expect to play much part in determining the fourth until after our entry into the Community.     In the following paragraphs, eachof the first 3 factors is discussed separately in turn, hut it should beborne in mind that they are inter-relatedi    For example, it would bemore advantageous for us to accept an 18 per cent &quot;key&quot; building up byequal steps over 8 years, than a 15 per cent &quot;key&quot; building up from10 per cent in the first year to the full 15 per cent at the end of 5 years.Equally, an 18 per cent &quot;key&quot; accompanied by receipts amounting to 6 percent would obviously be more advantageous than a 15 per cent &quot;key&quot; accompaniedby receipts amounting to only 2 per cent.Duration of special arrangements12.   As paragraph 5 pointed out, the main negotiating brief (AE(70) 4)envisaged that we should propose to the Six that our contributions to theCommunity budget should be subject to special arrangements for a total of13 years - 5 years during which we would be building up to our &quot;key&quot; level,one year at the &quot;key&quot; level and 7 years during which &quot;correctives&quot; would apply.    But in the light of the proposals the Commission have now made,it seems unrealistic to seek special arrangements for such a long period.The Six would almost certainly not be prepared to regard a 13 year period as a possible basis for serious discussion;   and at the very least theycould be expected to insist that if our full integration into theCommunity&apos;s financial system were to be deferred until the late 1980s,our voice in Community decisions involving expenditure from the budget(eg the fixing of agricultural pricos) should be much restricted duringmost of this period.    Moreover, 13 years is a very long time to tieourselves to pay a particular share of Community expenditure (the effect ofthe &quot;correctives&quot; would be to provide for only marginal changes from yearto year). :&apos;:&apos;&quot;;:&apos; ...        &apos; I;.        &apos;       .-.        &apos;     &apos; &apos; ,;   .   ; &apos;;.V. &apos;&apos;13.   What really matters to us on the timetable is that there should besufficient time for the economy to respond to the dynamic effects of our entry into the Community, before we begin to face a heavy burden of netcontributions to the budget.    We must therefore seek an adequate period during which to phase in our contributions gradually, preferably by a6
series of equal annual steps, and not, as in both alternatives proposed bythe Commission, starting with a large initial contribution in respect ofour first year of membership.    To obtain a further period of &quot;correctives&quot;after we have reached our &quot;key&quot; level is much less important, given that,if we faced the prospect of our contributions growing to an unacceptableamount, we were able to call for a review, with a reasonable expectation that it would produce a satisfactory outcome.    The Commission^ proposals that our contributions should be subject to special arrangements for only years and that the build-up to our &quot;key&quot; should start from a high initiallevel, can probably be regarded as a fairly extreme negotiating bid.     Inresponding to it we could point out that the Six are themselves phasing intheir present financial arrangements over a period of 8 years (1970-77)even though they started from a position in which they had already achievedsubstantial economic integration.     But it seems unlikely that we shall inthe end find it possible to reach agreement with the Six on terms more advantageous to us than a 5 year period in which to build up to our &quot;key&quot;by equal stages, followed by 3 years in which Kcorrectives&quot; would apply.The level of our &quot;key&quot; contribution14.   The figure eventually agreed on for our &quot;key&quot; will play a large partin determining what the cost of joining the Community trill bo to us inthe period for which special arrangements are agreed and will obviouslyset a very important precedent for settling the size of our contributionssubsequently.     In deciding on their own existing &quot;keys&quot;, the Six were able to take account of the results of their previous financial arrange-nonts, under which Community expenditure was financed from levy receipts and from balancing contributions which were already on a &quot;key&quot; basis.But they also appear to have had regard to the relationship between member countries&apos; &quot;keys&quot; and their shares of the total Cross National Product (GNP)of the Community.     For example, the Federal German Government in insisting on a &quot;key&quot; of no more than 32 per cent in 1970 sought to ensure that itspercentage share of total contributions to the budget at the end of theperiod during which &quot;correctives&quot; applied (ie in 1977) would not be larger than its percentage share of the Community^ GNP.7
15.  We shall similarly want to insist that our &quot;key&quot; should not he outof line with our share of the GNP of the enlarged Community.     In their proposals the Commission have suggested, apparently quite arbitrarily,that our &quot;key&quot; should be smaller than that of Germany, but larger thanthat of France, despite the fact that French GNP was 27 per cent biggerthan ours in 1969 and that the French are the main beneficiaries of community expenditure.    The Commissions two alternative schemes wouldhave the effect that by 1977 our &quot;key&quot; would bo either about   22^ per centor 25 per cent, whereas the paper we presented to the Six in July usedrecent OECD projections to show that by 1978 our share of the enlargedComnunity&apos;s GNP would be about 17 per cent.16.  We have to recognise however, that, so long as Communityexpenditure on agriculture remains at a high level, our pattern ofinternational trade and our relatively low level of agricultural self-sufficiency will make it inevitable that our net contribution to theCommunity budget should be substantial, even if v/e succeed in thenegotiations in having our &quot;key&quot; set at a level which corresponds toour GNP share.    Our calculations (on the basis of a Community budget of 4,500 million units of account, largely spent on agriculture) showthat a &quot;key&quot; of 17 per cent-would still mean that our net contributions to the budget would reach  215 million by the end of whatever period ofphasing in was agreed.    It seems very unlikely, however, that v/e shallbe able to reach agreement with the Six on a &quot;key&quot; of less than 17 per cent.Receipts17,  We have so far assumed that we shall receive only relatively smallpayments from the budget as a result of existing schemes of Communityexpenditure, v/hich mainly relate to agriculture.    The paper v/e presented to the Six in July estimated that our receipts in 1978 would amount to250 million units of account, of v/hich 200 million would be accountedfor by reimbursements of our expenditure on export restitutions etc, andon such of our production grants (including our assistance to hill farmers)as were found to be compatible v/ith the Common Agricultural Policy.    If,on tho other hand, the Community^ budget were increased after our entry8
in order to cover new schemes of Community expenditure on regional policy,technological co-operation, industrial collaboration etc (such as theCommission suggested in their comments on the paper we presented in July),there seems no reason to suppose that our receipts from these schemes would be so much greater than the additional contributions to the budgetwe would he called on to make in order to finance the higher expenditurethat our net position would be transformed.     The most realisticassumption to take at this stage is that such schemes would have no significant effect one way or the other on the size of the net transferburden facing us.18.   We could, however, suggest to the Six in the course of our negotiations that as they are asking us to adapt ourselves to the full obligations of membership of the Community over a much shorter transitional period thanthey themselves enjoyed, they should be prepared to make special additional payments to us from Community funds to help us to speed our integrationinto the enlarged Community.     The Community has in the past agreed tomake special payments to Germany and Italy which v/e could point to asprecedents for the kind of arrangements we were seeking.     The Six mightbe receptive to such a claim if it offered a way of bridging the gap between our position and theirs on the whole question of Community finance and of reaching a satisfactory M communautaire&quot; solution.19.   It would be better however, to hold such a claim in reserve and not include it in our opening bid.     This is partly because it would be verydifficult to justify in our opening bid a claim for a particular overallamount of rouoipii    and partly because if we started with such a claim,those who are unsympathetic to our entry might suggest that it showedv/e could not afford to join the Community without special assistance.Once bargaining starts with the Six, however, we could take the line that  /e could only make concessions on the size of our &quot;key&quot;, or on the period and pace of our build-up to.it, if in return we were able to rely on .obtaining special payments from Community funds which would prevent ournet contribution to the budget from becoming so large that v/e would facean unacceptable transfer of resources to the Community.9
Conclusions20,   Wo therefore conclude that we cannot expect to reach agreement with the Six on the question of our contributions to the Community budget on terms more favourable to us than the following:a, Our gross contributions should be subject to a &quot;key&quot; of17 per cent;b, we should have a period of 5 years in which to build up tothis &quot;key&quot; by equal annual steps;c, there would be a further period of at most 3 years in which&quot;correctives&quot; would prevent our percentage share of total grosscontributions from increasing more than marginally;d, in exchange for any special payments from the Community budgetto speed our integration into the Community, we should almost certainly have to accept more onerous terms governing our contributions than those set out in a.-c.je, there would be a review provision which v/e could invoke atany time if the burden of our net contributions to the budgetthreatened to become intolerable , *21,  A key of 17 per cent phased in over 5 years would moan thatif our forecast of a Community budget in 1977 of 4?500 million units of account largely spent on agriculture proved correct, our net contribution in that year would amount to about  215 million.    Even if Communityexpenditure on agriculture turned out to be substantially lower, so thatthe total budget amounted to only 355O0 million units of account, ournet contribution would still bo about  245 million,   (if, cn tho other hand the budget had been substantially increased by that stage in order tooover additional schemes of Community expenditure we would expect ourreceipts to rise in line with our additional contributions so that ournet contribution would not go beyond about  215 million.)     In addition,however, the other &quot;impact&quot; effects of our entry into the Community would on balance be substantially unfavourable, because our adoption of the10
Common Agricultural Policy would, add about  90 million to the cost ofour annual import bill for agricultural products;   because higher foodcosts would lead to some loss of competitiveness and a worsening of thevisible trade balance by, perhaps, some  75 million;   and because thenet effect of changes in tariffs and industrial trade patterns wouldalso be adverse, perhaps to the extent of at lea*i Jg30 rafXELcfc.,   thus to settle for a &quot;key&quot; of 17 per cent phased in over 5 years would imply a readiness to accept that the overall balance of payments costs on current account of our entry into the Community might build up by 1978-79to a figure of the order of  4-60 million per annum.22,   whether it would be worthwhile in purely economic terms to accept such a heavy balance of payments cost   would depend largely on whetherthe &quot;dynamic&quot; effects of entry into the Community were strong enough tobring about a lasting improvement in our economic growth rate despite the problems of economic management which would be involvf-ri -in dealingwith the balance of payments.    Purely for the purposes of illustration,the following table shows that a relatively modest acceleration in ourgrowth rate would be sufficient after a period to cover the costs of entry,allow for some deterioration in the terms - of trade in order to solve thetransfer problem, and still leave a margin to spare for our own benefit.&quot;: :;-&quot;f11

Thereafter our&quot;reference amount&quot; would exceed our percentage contributions as determinedby the system of &quot;correctives&quot; and so the latter would operate to limit thegrowth of our gross contributions.   Similarly, under the Community^ second alternative, our gross contributions in 1973 would be eaual to our &quot;referenceamount&quot; as this would fall between the.

In subsequent years the&quot;reference amount&quot; would exceed the maximum limits proposed by theCommission and so again would become irrelevant to the amount which weactually had to pay.13
