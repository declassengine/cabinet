THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S government cp(70) HO ,,copY N0   5619 November 1970CABINETELECTRICITY prices memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of Statefor Trade and industry,    At their meeting on 19 November (CM(70) 39th Conclusions, Minute 4)Cabinet asked for further information about the effect of modifying theelectricity price increases:a. by aiming at full amount needed to achieve the financial objective(estimated at  160 million ignoring the fuel cost adjustments already made), but reverting to the 1967 structure of tariffs..b. by foregoing the recovery of the past shortfall in the financial objective, and so restricting the total increase to about  120 million/year (also excluding past fuel cost adjustments).2,    Because most Boards have not yet submitted their proposals, I cannot besure whether such shading as they may be proposing will in fact result intheir aiming to recover nearly the full  160 million/year or somesubstantially smaller amount which may turn out to be nearer  120 million/year.    The estimate of  160 million/year was not based on a summation ofthe Boards * proposals but was merely a national calculation of what increasethey needed in aggregate to recover their financial objectives in full overthe 5 years 1 April 1969-31 March 1974*   My Department has been told thatsome, at least, of the Boards are thinking of deferring part of the recoveryfor a further tariff revision 12 months or so later, because they fear thatto aim at the full increase at one step would be commercially inadvisableand also unacceptable to their Consultative Councils01
Course a.3.    Subject to this reservation, the full recovery under a, above wouldrequire an increase to each consumer of about 15 per cent compared with hischarges following the 1967 tariff revision.   This would mean:for large consumers (ie who have already borne increases of about10 per cent through the fuel cost adjustment) - 5 per cent for domestic and other consumers -15 per centThere will be difficulty in persuading the Electricity Boards to acceptincreases on this pattern:   the industry is opposed to raising prices to large industrial consumers as they consider this is not justified by costs,(There are also technical problems resulting from minor price adjustmentssince 1967 and contract conditions, but I would hope these could be resolved).Course b.4.    The estimates assumed that recovery of shortfall in the first 2 yearsof the quinquennium (ie  130 million in 19^9/70 and  80 million in 1970/71)would he achieved by spreading it equally over the remaining 3 years of the quinquennium.     So to forego recovery is broadly equivalent to cutting back the price increase to about  120 million/year.This reduced increase might be achieved in any of the ways set out in cases1 to 4 a. of the table Annexed to my previous paper (CP(70) 107).Further possible courses5.    I have considered whether there is a third possibility.     For example the maximum increase to any consumer might be limited to 20 per cent.Because of the different circumstances of individual Boards, I see no wayof achieving this limitation without some loss of revenue:   it would not bepossible to persuade any Board that needs a smaller increase to introduce alarger increase to make up for the shortfall elsewhere.    At a guess, a 20per cent ceiling might reduce revenue by some  20 million a year making it possible to raise perhaps  140 million a year,2
6,    If the limitation were more severe - to a maximum increase of, say, 15per cent - the loss of revenue might approximate to  40 million (the patterneg of case 3a. of the table annexed to my previous paper).   But this assumesno flexibility in tariff structure, ie the same increase in every element ofthe tariff for domestic consumers, and if any flexihility were allowed theloss of revenue might exceed  40 million.Eecommenda tion7.    I have (in CP(70) 107) made clear my view that the right course is notto demur to the proposals of the Boards until we know what the ConsultativeCouncils make of them (subject to some marginal shading if I can arrangethis at small cost).   As to the proposals discussed in Cabinet today, my view is:1.    Course a.   I do not think we should ask the electricity industry,and I am doubtful whether it will agree, to continue the distortionof its tariffs by over-charging large industrial consumers,,   If we wish to contain the electricity industry&apos;s investment, it is essentialthat the domestic tariffs - and, not least, the off-peak tariffs which ought to go up by 25 per cent or so - should reflect costs.2,    Course b.   If nevertheless my colleagues feel we must curtail the domestic price increase at the present time, I think this should be&apos; done, not by reducing the domestic increase to 15 per cent (or any ofthe other variants restricting the revenue increase by the full  40million) but by accepting a smaller shortfall from the financial objective and inviting the electricity industry to keep the domesticincreases - other than the off-peak increase - below 20 per cent.   Weshould also accept that a further round of increases in about a yearmay be needed.J d department of Trade and Industry SW119 November 19703
