DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS government cp(70) 119 COPY NO    0016 December 1970CABINETCIVIL SERVICE NON-INDUSTRIAL manpower memorandum by the Lord Privy SealWhen Cabinet last discussed civil service non-industrial manpoweron 22 September I was invited to keep the numbers under review and toreport again in due course (CM(70) 21st Conclusions, Minute 4).    An early decision is now needed on the size of the service in 1971-72 to enableDepartmental Estimates to be drawn up,2.     The Cabinet discussion on 22 September concluded that the aim should be to seek tc reduce the number of non^industrial civD. servantsbelow 500^000 by 1 April 1971, to achieve further reductions by1 April 1972 and to reach a target of 470,000 by 1 April 1973.    The basicstrategy was to look for functions which could be eliminated and so lead toeconomies in the demand for Civil Service manpower.    At the same time,and apart from savings secured by a reduction of functions, departments were also to try to reduce the numbers of staff engaged m $out&amp;watteigfunctions by 1 April 1972.3.     The Departmental staffing estimates before Cabinet on22 September, as 8v$xx&amp;aizfes&amp;&amp; in my memorandum CP(70) 41 were-1.4.71 1.4.72503,900 516,960The figures since submitted by Ministers in the light of Cabinet discussion and a revised assessment of needs and prioritise ares-1.4.71 1.4,72501,830 515,680Details are set out in Annexes 1 and 2.    Thus the total for 1 April 1971 hasbeen reduced by just over 2,000 (a net figure, bigger reductions beingoffset by increases in Defence and elsewhere).    The total for I April 1972shows little change 1 only a small reduction from the level proposedbefore the Cabinet discussion.    Moreover this 1 April 1972 figurecontains no margin against major contingencies.    For example, there isno provision for any introductory v/ork on a Value Added Tax (VAT) or
possible new manpower &quot;intensive policies in the social or employmentareas (in every case I have seen, the principle of greater selectivity in social policy involves in practice increased Civil Service manpower)4.     The forecast figures for 1 April 1971 are disappointing, since theyare still well above the 5 00, 000 mark to which I attach great importance0Nevertheless they offer some hope.    I have had bilateral exchanges witha number of my colleagues and will be having more.    In addition, myofficials have maintained a steady dialogue with their Departmentalcolleagues since September,    As a result, I believe that although thetotal in^post figure for 1 November ^vras just over 500, 000 it is potentiallywithin our reach to ensure that the number of non-industrial civil servants in post at 1 April 1971 is brought below 500,000.   But to do so will call for the contuming help and co-operation of all Departments in making thenecessary economies at the margin in the next three months.    Jf theseeconomies are not secured, a figure below 5 00, 000 at 1 April 1971 wouldnot be attainable except by some sort of arbitrary action, such as forexample, an enforced ban on certain kinds of recruitment in February-March.    I do not like arbitrary action of this sort, for it does not smackof or make for good management.     But I consider we should take it if we find in (say) a month ls time that we cannot by other means avoid exceeding the 500,000 mark for 1 April 1971.    I invite my colleagues to make thisunnecessary by letting me know within the next few weeks of further reductions they can make by 1 April 1971,5.     The figures for 1 April 1972 raise an acutely difficult dilemma forour policy on containing Civil Service growth and achieving staff reductionsby a reduction in functions.    Following upon the reviews of functions and activities of Departments initiated by the Prime Minister&apos;s minute of28 September, a number of proposals are now on the stocks which couldtlead to manpower reductions in the course of time.    These are not yetreflected in the forecast total in paragraph 3, and with some of them themain manpower savings would accrue after rather than before 1 April 1972.It is in any event clear that we must quickly identify those which can help us in this dilemma and urge that their implementation be accelerated inevery possible way.    Although we can make no very precise judgment insuch uncertain circumstances, we believe that with this help and with verytight pressure on the Departmental bids before they are finalised we could bring the total of Departmental forecasts (without taking account of thereduction resulting from the proposed Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) -see next paragraph) for 1 April 1972 down to 510, 000J to which some,000 to 2,000 should prudently be added for contingencies.6.     This uncertain conjecture is made the more uncertain by doubts about the policy to be adopted on VAT and about the timing of the creationof the proposed CAA.    Introducing VAT on the early timetable hitherto contemplated would add something of the order of 4,000 to the 1 April 1972numbers.    Against this, the establishment of the proposed CAA would makea big presentational impact (though not a true reduction) by transferringeventually up to 6, 000 staff outside the Civil Service..    If this transfercould be effected before 1 April 1972, this presentational benefit s*ould be available at that date.2
7.     The difficult dilemma facing us is whether it would be right to letnumbers rise as indicated in the preceding paragraphsj, beyond ouradopted aim for 1 April 1972, while awaiting the bigger reductions infunctions which are hoped for in subsequent years.    The plans we madein Opposition for reducing civil service numbers were dependent on some very drastic changes which included a radical reduction in the size of theNational Savings Department with its 15,000 staff, where savings, if theyare to be achieved, will new take longer than was envisaged in Opposition,To hold the 1 April 1972 figure below the kind of level just indicated(510,000 - 512, 000 before taking account of either VAT or CAA) without such drastic changes as we then envisaged would, I believe, inescapablyinvolve enforcing arbitrary reductions on Departmental Ministers: say, a percentage cut of something between Zj per cent and 5 per cent overall tohold it to 5 00,.000 and provide a contingency margin.    Such a course wculdcertainly squeeze out any pockets of under &quot;-employment that may remain,bat it could be argued that a major percentage cut would result in aserious decline of service to the public in certain areas and would require modification of agreed policies.    It would run counter to the systematicapproach to  he functions of Government that we have commended.There would also be strong, and possibly damaging, Staff Side reaction:they would be quick to point out that staffing economies were not beingrelated to economies in functions as they had been led to expect.8.     I know that there are questions about the ways of presenting thesefigures, and we will certainly examine them to find the most advantageous.But I can hold out no hope that any presentational device will let us avoid the hard choice, so far as 1971-72 is concerned? whether to continue inthe stance that we have adopted of systematically reviewing and rationalisingfunctions and policies as the proper way towards an eventually smallerCivil Service; or to impose a manpower reduction policy in 1971-72, if need be by rough and arbitrary methods, because of out clear politicalcommitment on Civil Service numbers.    Although its adoption will exposea very sensitive political flank, I personally favour the first of thesechoice s.9.     &quot;We have to make this choice now to enable DepartmentalEstimates to be framed consistently with our intentions within the tighttimetable imposed.    And we must do so in die knowledge that the detailspublished in the Estimates will enable our intentions to be discerned , ifindeed we have not made them known in response to Questions before then.If my colleagues agree with the course I have favoured in the preceding paragraph, I suggest that they authorise Departments in consultation withthe Civil Service Department to revise their forecasts in order to achieve a total of Departmental non-industrial numbers of not more than 510, 000at 1 April 1972; and to prepare the Estimates for approval on this basis.We could leave for later consideration the treatment and public presentation of the figures modified as necessary to take account of the need for a contingency margin and any later developments.    It would be my hope thatsuch developments would include still further manpower economies arisingfrom the continuing review of functions and that these would -enable us tobring our in-post manpower figures for 1 April 1972 close to or indeed belowthe 500,000 mark.3
10.     To stun up, I advise Cabinets-a. to endorse the aim that the total of non-industrialnumbers at 1 April 1971 should be held below 500,000;b. to invite Ministers individually to seek further reductions in theXr 1 April 1971 forecasts to ensure this resultsbut to agree that arbitrary action should be taken if itappears that it cannot be achieved otherwise;c. to authorise the preparation of 1971-72 Estimates onthe basis set out in paragraph 93d. to invite me to consider further in the New Year, inthe light of later developments, the treatment andpublic presentation of the figures;e. to invite me, in consultation with Departmental ministers and as part of the continuing review of functions, to seekin the course of the New Year further economies with aview if possible to bringing the total of non-industrialnumbers at 1 April 1972 close to or below 500,000,J civil  Service Department SWl16 December 19704
