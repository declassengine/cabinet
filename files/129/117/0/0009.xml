THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTMONOPOLIES, MERGERS AND RESTRICTIVE PRACTICESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and regional development at its meeting on 15th January the Cabinet invited me to circulate a draft white Paper on monopolies, mergers and restrictive practices (CM. (64)4th Conclusions). A draft is annexed to this memorandum. It sets out in some detail the proposals described in very broad outline in the statement I made to parliament on the 15th January.2. There are some points to which I should like to draw my colleagues&apos;attention.Monopolies3. I have considered carefully the Poole Committee&apos;s proposal that, in orderto meet the criticism that the Commission acts as both &quot;judge and prosecutor&quot;,an independent officer of the Crown (a Registrar) should be appointed to presentthe evidence and argue the case before the Commission, i.e., act as &quot; prosecutor &quot;.I have, however, concluded that we ought not to go to the length of what would amount to an adversary procedure. For this to work it would be necessary to lay down a comprehensive set of rules for the guidance of the Registrar and theCommission. I doubt whether we yet know enough about the behaviour ofmonopolies to be able to draw up such rules. Moreover, I think that some people would regard the adoption of an &quot; adversary &quot; procedure as involving a departure from the neutral and uncommitted approach to monopoly which in my statement to Parliament I said that the Government were satisfied was right.4. The alternative which I propose (in paragraph 14) would, I think,effectively meet the substance of the criticism which has been made of the workingof the Monopolies Commission. In distinguishing more clearly between the two stages of an inquiry, we should in practice achieve sufficient separation of theinvestigatory and adjudicatory functions of the Commission. The Chairman ofthe Commission, whom I have consulted, considers that my proposal would be quite practicable.5. At our discussion in Cabinet last month, my colleagues felt doubtfulof the advisability of giving the Monopolies Commission the responsibility for initiating inquiries into monopolies (as I had proposed in CP. (64) 11). On theother hand, I am satisfied that the present system is not satisfactory. My proposal should give us the best of both worlds. The initiative would come from theproposed Registrar of Monopolies, but we should keep in our own hands thedecision on whether or not an inquiry should be undertaken.6. I have reflected on the desirability of having power to break up a monopoly. I believe that it would be wise to have this power in reserve, even though we should seldom want to use it. We might want merely to be able to order a firmto divest itself of holdings in other firms. I recognise, however, that it often mightbe difficult to &quot; hive off &quot; units which would be capable of independent operation.But on occasion this would be feasible. Sometimes the monopoly firm will not havePrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1964CP. (64) 5925th February, 1964CABINET4000
had time to;&quot; digest &quot;its new acquisitions, or it may make a practice of operating in separate units which should be readily severable. The fact that this operation would be carried out by presenting a scheme to Parliament for its approval should provide satisfactory safeguards for industry.Mergers ,7. My proposal that we should take power to enable us to ask the monopolies Commission to look into a merger which would lead to a monopoly(or would strengthen an existing one) is primarily designed to allow us to dealwith the I.C.I./Courtaulds type of case. We must not be caught without any meansof investigating mergers which arouse widespread, public unease. With mergers,however, I have come to the conclusion that we should keep wholly in our own hands the initiation of an inquiry, that is to say, we should not require the proposedRegistrar of Monopolies to make suggestions to us for inquiries into mergers.His only function in this field would be to carry out for the monopolies commission the necessary investigations if we decided to have an inquiry made into a particular merger. I hope this will meet the anxieties expressed by mycolleagues when last we discussed this problem.Restrictive trade practices8. Our chief concern must be to deal with the loopholes which have beenfound in the 1956 Act. But in amending the Act we must carefully scrutiniseSection 21. I am not satisfied that this Section is in all respects fulfilling theGovernment&apos;s intentions.Services9. We are all agreed that we should confine investigations into restrictive practices and monopolies to the field of commercial services, i.e., that we should leave the professions alone. But beyond this I think we should keep our hands asfree as possible and that we should avoid giving pledges for the future in respectof particular services. Since the initiative rests wholly with us, we need not havean inquiry made in any particular case unless we want to.Conclusion10. Recent comment has again emphasised the importance of theGovernment being shown to be ready to deal over a wider field with restrictive practices and with abuses of monopoly power.11. I accordingly invite the agreement of my colleagues to the early publication of the White Paper annexed to this memorandum.E. H.Board of Trade, S.W.1,25th February, 1964.
ANNEX       61DRAFT MITE^PAPER ON MONOPOLIES,MERGERS AND&quot; RESTRICTIVE.PRACTICESLegislation on monopolies and restrictive practices is designedto improve the efficiency of the economy.2.     Frequently the existence of some form of competition is the simplest means of ensuring that an organisation^ resources are used in the most economic and effective way possible.     Competitivetrading conditions encourage individuals and firms to break free from practices and ways of thought that are no longer compatible with the noods of a vigorous, up-to-date and efficient economy.They encourage firms to make use of modern equipment, and toadopt without delay desirable innovations in technique.     Theyensure that the benefits of technical progress are shared byconsumers, since the prices that the public pays are not undulyinflated by restrictive agreements between firms,3.     The forces of competition can be frustrated by agreements to suppress, control or prevent competition.     Such agreementsrestrict the flexibility of the economy, hinder the adoption ofthe most efficient methods of production, and militate againstthe most efficient allocation of scarce national resources.     Theyare therefore detrimental to a sustained growth of the economy.Legislation on restrictive practices is designed to prevent thedistortion of competition by such devices.k.     The operation of monopoly may also be detrimental to the economy.      In monopoly situations, competition is by definitionlimited or excluded.     In competitive trading conditions, themarket makes a judgment on the relative efficiency, enterprise,costs and acumen of firms.     Legislation on monopolies is designedto provide a means for forming a judgment on firms&apos; operations in conditions where the forces of a competitive market arelacking or inadequate.     Monopoly legislation is not necessarilydesigned to foster competition;    its more important purpose maybe to ensure that no harmful effects arise from the absence of effective competition.     Mien a single firm dominates the market,there is always the possibility either that its power may beabused, or, on the other hand, that its resources may not be fully exploited to the benefit of the economy.5.     The present statute law on monopolies and restrictive practices is contained in the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices(Inquiry and Control) Act, 1948, and the Restrictive trade practices Act, 1956.     In recent years there has been growingdiscussion and debate on whether the 1948. and 1956 Acts are inpractice doing all that is necessary to implement the intentionswith which they were introduced.5.     The Government have made a thorough study of experience bothin this country and abroad, in the course of which they have given careful consideration to all the views expressed to them by industry and others.     They have reached the conclusion that thelavir, although to a considerable degree effective, needs to be strengthened and extended.     The principal changes proposed aresot out in this paper.7.     The Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (inquiry and Control)Act, 1948, provides for the investigation of monopoly situations&quot;by the Monopolies Commission at the direction of the Board ofTrade.     For the purpose of this Act, a monopoly situation is1
broadly speaking one where at least one-third of the market isin tho hands of a single firm (or connected group of firms).The Commission may he required to report on whether the monopolysituation or the &quot;things done&quot; as a result of or to preserve that situation operate against the public interest.&apos;8.     The attitude to monopoly in the law is neutral;    there is nopresumption that monopoly power is pjpijna^f aci  had..Approach to monopoly9.     The Government believe that it is right to continue thisneutral and uncommitted approach to monopoly.     Optimum efficiency of operation may demand large plants, costly research and highly developed marketing arrangements.     Units must be large enoughto raise the necessary capital to take risks.     Large-scale production may be necessary to compete in the export market.Thus there may sometimes be room only for one or two large firms in an industry, but even in such cases, there may be genuinecompetition between the firms, or there may be competition fromimports or from substitutable products.     There may also bepotential competition from other concerns looking for profitableand unexploited markets.10.    The Government have concluded that it would be wrong tointroduce into the law any presumption that monopoly is in itselfundesirable, without regard to the conditions under which itoperates, or to the manner in which it conducts its business.It follows from this basic approach that judgment should only bereached on a particular monopoly after investigation into howit is in fact operating.     Such inquiries can best be carried outby an administrative tribunal like the Monopolies Commission.The Government do not therefore propose to make changes in the basic principles of the lav/ on monopolies.11.    There are, however, some important changes in the law whichthe Government think desirable.     The Commission&apos;s inquiries havebeen of great value, but criticism has been expressed of certain aspects of the law as it stands;    the length of time which mustgo to the production of a Report, the lack of powers on the partof the Government effectively to implement the Commission&apos;srecommendations, and the impression that the same body is being asked to carry out the function of &quot;both judge and prosecutor&quot;.12.    This latter point has been made particularly by industry.It rests perhaps to some extent on a misconception.     TheCommission is not (like the Restrictive Practices Court) a judicial tribunal concerned with the aioplication of a body oflaw in which the legislature has laid down rules for determining whether particular practices are or are not against the publicinterest.     Nor is it more concerned with establishing the facts&quot;against&quot; a firm under review than with establishing the facts in its favour.     As an administrative tribunal, the Commission&apos;stask is to elicit and examine impartially all the relevant facts.13.   Nevertheless, the Government believe that it would be desirableto draw a clearer distinction between the two stages of an inquiry into a monopoly - the investigation into the facts, i.e. intowhat is done by the monopoly, and the subsequent determination ofthe consequences of these acts for the public interest.1U.    The Government consider that this object would be achieved bythe appointment of a Registrar of Monopolies, who would beresponsible for making the investigation into the facts and for setting out for the consideration of the Monopolies Commission the2
questions and issues involved.     He would be available to assistthe Commission in their task of determining where the publicinterest lay by making such further investigation endelucidation as the Commission might require.15.    The Government contemplate that the Registrar of Monopoliesshould have the following additional responsibilities in thefield of monopolies:-(i)    the compiling and publication of a !Iregister&quot; ofmonopolies.     In effect this would be a working list;it is not envisaged that firms themselves would berequired to notify a monopoly;(ii)    the selection, subject to approval by the Board ofTrade, of cases for inquiry by the Commission;(iii) the &quot;supervision&quot; of undertakings given by firms tothe Board of Trade, or of Orders made by the Board,in implementation of recommendations of the Commission.1.6.    The Government thus envisage that the Registrar would maintain a general oversight in the field of monopoly.     He would needsimilar powers to those now possessed by the Monopolies Commissionin order to enable him to make his investigations.17. The Registrar would also have the duty of carrying outinvestigations required under the Government&apos;s proposals onmergers (paragraph 26) and commercial services (paragraph h,9).Powers to implement the Commission^ ^oj^jnoenjd^tioj^18.    The Government are satisfied that their existing powers to implement recommendations of the Commission are inadequate forthe purposes these pov/ers now have to serve.     When the powers were obtained in 19k8 they were in the main designed to enableGovernments to act against collective restrictive agreements.In 1956 the responsibility for dealing with collective agreementspassed to the Restrictive Practices Court, and the responsibilityof the Monopolies Commission was confined, primarily to monopolysituations.      The powers in Section 10 of the Monopolies and restrictive Practices (inquiry and Control) Act, 19U8, canseldom be brought effectively to bear to compel a firm to changetrading policies which the Monoplies Commission in its presentsphere may find to be against the public interest.19.    The Government would always wish to proceed where possible by the negotiation of voluntary undertakings from the firms concerned.     But if the object of the legislation is not to be frustrated, they must have reserve powers to deal with any ofthe considerable variety of ways in which the Commission may find that a situation or practice is against the public interest.The Government propose to arm themselves with such poyrers.20.    For the extreme case,  they would include the power, under ascheme approved by Parliament, to give directions requiring the monopoly firm to divest itself of undertakings or of holdings,in other companies.     The Government believe that such action would rarely if ever be necessary, but they would wish to providefor the possibility that an occasion might arise where nothingless would safeguard the public interest.21.    Between 1953 and 1956 the Monopolies Commission was larger than it is now and was empowered to work in groups.      The size of the Commission was reduced when collective restrictive3
agreements were transferred to the Restrictive Practices Court,by the 1956 Act.     The Government believe that the commission should be enlarged, so that it can complete inquiries more quickly (and be able to take on new work on mergers and services),and that it&apos;should again be given the right to work simultaneously in groups on several inquiries at one time.     The Government there-fore propose that provision should be made to increase the membership of the Commission to a maximum of twenty-five.     Thiswould allow it to work in three groups.     Two Deputy Chairmenworking full time would then be required.A^fJSLJi^trumejvt22.    By the changes described in the preceding paragraphs theGovernment will be equipping themselves with a new and more effective instrument for investigating the operation of predominantenterprises, and with appropriate powers for safeguarding thepublic interest.Merger^23.    The present 1m makes no provision for inquiry into mergersor takeovers as such, even where they would result in monopolysituations which would then be liable to inquiry by the monopolies commission.21)..    The Government recognise the contribution which mergers can make to the well-being of the economy by producing the strongerunits under progressive management which are essential in the increasingly competitive conditions of international trade.     Theywelcome such mergers.25.    There is, however, a small minority of mergers which may haveharmful results.     The Government think that they should be ableto have an inquiry made into mergers of a kind where thepossibility of damage to the public interest cannot be excluded.It is expected that in practice an inquiry would be called forrelatively seldom.26.    The Government therefore propose that the new monopolies commission should be empowered to make an inquiry, at the directionof the Board of Trade, into any merger which v/ould produce amonopoly1&apos;5, or would increase the power of an existing monopoly.27.    The Government contemplate that the legislation should direct the Commission&apos;s attention to considerations which would help them in their inquiries to decide where the public interest lay.Such considerations would include efficiency, technical and technological advance, industrial growth and competitive power in international trade.28.    The Government do not propose to take powers to hold up a merger while it is being investigated.     The implication thiswould carry of prior consent to merging being required could wellfrustrate desirable mergers.29,    When the Commission had completed an inquiry, their functionwould be , as in the case of monopolies, to report on whether the merger was against the public interest, and if so in what respects.They would have to evaluate the evidence available on such questions as the extent to which competition would bo reduced andthe benefits to be expected from the larger scale of operation which the merger would permit.     In the light of the Commission^Report, it would then be for the Government to take such action as they believed to be necessary.* In the sense of control of at least one-third of the market
Cmnd. 1603 and 22U6530.    In talcing the requisite powers to act on such reports, theGovernment would have to provide for the possibility that in an exceptional case they might he satisfied that nothing short ofundoing the merger would safeguard the public interest.     Whorea merger had not &quot;been completed they would have to he able to prohibit it, or alternatively, allow it to continue subject tocertain conditions.RestrictivQ ,^rMe P^ctices31.    The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 195o, is based, on theprinciple that restrictive trading agreements are in generaladverse to the public interest because they impede the free playof competition.     Circumstances may exist which justify suchpractices, but this must be demonstrated in each case.     The main features of the Act are thus:(i)    the compulsory registration of agreements embodyingrestrictive practices as defined in the Act andtheir automatic reference to the restrictive practices Court;(ii)    the presumption that such practices are against thepublic interest unless shown otherwise;(iii)    the provision of specific grounds on which the partiescan plead that a restrictive practice is justified.32.    The Government believe that as an instrument for dealing withrestrictive practices the Act does not require any fundamental change.      It has secured the termination of many restrictiveagreements, and thus promoted more competitive trading conditions.33.   At the same time, this Act broke new ground for Britishindustry and for the Courts.     It is not surprising that in thecourse of time loopholes and inadequacies have emerged which werenot anticipated.     The Act has not always succeeded in promotingfully competitive conditions in industry.     Experience has shownthat it is possible to devise agreements and practices whichwill effectively deter competition without being caught by the Act3k.    It is the Government&apos;s intention to amend the Act to closesuch loopholes.Infpjpmaj^ij^35.    The Government have taken account of statements in the lasttwo reports of the Registrar of Restrictive Trading Agreements--to the effect that not infrequently the ending of a price-fixingagreement is followed by the parties entering into an agreement under which price lists and. similar information are exchanged.In certain circumstances, this system may hinder the growth of genuine competition which the ending of the price-fixingagreement was designed to secure.     The Government have concluded that this is a problem which must be dealt with.      They recognisethat there are occasions on which the exchange of informationbetween firms may be beneficial.     Comparisons of costs can, forexample, be used as a means of raising levels of productivity,end the Government welcome such arrangements.     Other exchanges of information may be harmless.      But the Government are notprepared to see the intention of the 1956 Act undermined byexchanges of information the purpose and effect of which is to limit competition.      They therefore propose to make a wide range of information agreements subject to registration.
39.    There are other changes which would strengthen the operationof the Act.     Experience has shown that it is possible to reproduce the restrictive effect of an agreement which has alreadybeen condemned by making another agreement which is restrictive insomewhat different terms.     This, though of course it has to be registered, is not within the scope of the Order already made bythe Court because it is not technically an agreement !ito likeeffect&quot;.      The Government therefore propose that recourse to thisdevice for evading the findings of the Court should be prevented by a provision restraining parties from making such agreementswithout the leave of the Court.40. The Government also propose to introduce a more effectivedeterrent to deliberate evasion of registration of agreements.Gr gund^ 0if jsj^adinghi.    The Government have given careful consideration to the, commonly referred- to as &quot;ggrounds, commonly referred, to as &quot;gateways&quot;, in Section 21  ofthe Act  on which a restriction can be justified.      They believethat these gounds allow all the specific pleas in favour of a restrictive agreement which merit serious consideration, and donot propose to extend them.      In introducing amending legislation,they will, however, give consideration to the desirability of amending Section 21  in the light of experience gained, since thepassage of the Act.k-2.    The Government have taken account of representations made tothem by industry to the effect that the operation of the Act hasbeen unduly stringent and has resulted in the abandonment of restrictions which do no harm to the public or to the national interest and which are beneficial to the industries in question.The Government believe that it would seriously weaken the lav/ to admit justification on the ground of benefit to an industry.That, in the view of industries with restrictive agreements, is636.    The Government&apos;s proposals are designed to keep to a minimum the danger that beneficial or harmless exchanges of information would be impeded.     Registration would not be automatic.      Instead,the Board of Trade would be given power to call up informationagreements for registration class by class, and would use this power to call up only such classes as appeared to be being used as a way round the Act.37.    The Government recognise that the grounds of pleading inSection 21 of the 1956 Act would often not be appropriate for thedefence of information agreements;    such an agreement might beinnocent of restraint of competition, but it could not be shown to confer any of the specific benefits provided for in Section 21.The Government propose, however, to introduce a new ground ofpleading, as an alternative to Section 21.     This is described in paragraph U3.Bilateral agreements33,    Competition can also be restricted by setting up a series ofapparently unconnected bilateral agreements, in each of which only one party accepts a restriction.    These can be used to operate a price ring or a central selling scheme.     At present,these agreements are not registrable because the Act covers onlyagreements in which at least two parties accept a restriction.The Government propose to amend the Act to make agreementsregistrable even when restrictions are accepted by one party only,without at the same time bringing within its scope those ordinary commercial transactions of the kind which are already exemptedunder the 1956 Act.Other changes
CONFIDENTIAL 67their rjy.spn oV etre .     The presumption that such agreements arelikely to he prejudicial to the public interest is fundamentalto the 1956 Act, and the Government are satisfied that this must remain the lynch-pin of policy and legislation on restrictive practices.!j-3.    The object of the legislation is, however, to encouragecompetition.      In this context, the Government believe that itwould be possible without undermining the basic presumption ofthe Act to make one change designed to meet industry&apos;s concern about agreements which genuinely do no harm.      They propose thatthere should be a new ground of pleading, as an alternative to section 21, under which the parties would be allowed to pleadthat an agreement was not contrary to the public interest because it did not restrict or deter competition.kk.    This new ground woliM be particularly appropriate for thedefence of information agreements, when they are brought withinthe scope of the Act, but its use would not be limited to them.1-I-5.    The amendments described in this section do not imply anyfundamental change in the principles which underlie restrictive practices legislation.      Their cumulative effect, however,  shouldbe to make this legislation a much more effective weapon fordealing with agreements and arrangements the effect of which is to limit competition between firms.Services.I46.    The Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (inquiry and Control)Act, 19^-8, and the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956, withcertain minor exceptions apply only to monopolies and restrictive practices in the supply of goods.kl&apos;*    In a modern economy, the sector concerned with the provisionof services becomes increasingly important.      The government believe that it is wrong in principle that there is no legislative provision for investigating monopoly and restrictive practices inthe field of commercial services and they propose to make such provision.h8.    The Government do not, however, think that it would be rightor practicable at this stage to treat services in the same way as goods throughout the legislation on restrictive practices andmonopolies.     Not enough is yet known about the actual operationof restrictive practices in the supply of services to enable theGovernment to say that such practices must be presumed to be contrary to the public interest, or that the considerations setout in the 1956 Act for judging restrictions in the supply ofgoods would he appropriate to services.      Before the 19^4-8 Act,knowledge about restrictions on the supply of goods was equallyincomplete.      Investigations carried out by the monopolies commission under the 19l;-8 Act provided a solid background offactual information in the light of which it became possible and appropriate to introduce the judicial procedure contained in the1956 Act.k10.    The Government propose to adopt in respect of commercialservices the same pragmatic approach which was applied to goodsin ^^^.8.      That is to say, they would take powers to refer to the monopolies Commission for investigation and report restrictive practices, monopoly situations or mergers in the field of such services.     These powers would be wide enough to enable theGovernment also to make a general reference on particular practices(for example, agreements on charges) over the whole field orany part of the field of commercial services.7
50.    These inquiries would follow the pattern established in the19^!-8 Act.     The Monopolies Commission would report to theGovernment on the effect on the public interest, and it would rest with the Government to take appropriate action on theCommission^ report.     The Government would need powers whichwould make it possible for them to deal adequately with anyrestrictive practices or use of monopoly power which theCommission might find to be against the public interest.Conclusion51.     National prosperity depends on the well-being and prosperity of the economy.     The proposals outlined in this paper are means to this end.     Practices in restraint of competition and abuse of monopoly power in industry will be subject to more effectiveprocedures.     The Government will have new powers for dealingwith monopoly and restrictive practices in the provision ofcommercial services.     The Government are at the same time (intheir legislation on individual resale price maintenance) taking action to encourage more- competition in the distributive trades.Taken together, the Government believe that these measures willstimulate enterprise end efficiency in all sectors of the economy.52.    The Government propose to introduce legislation on the lines indicated in this paper as soon as possible;    this will not,however, be practicable in the course of the present Parliament..2U,th February, 196k8
