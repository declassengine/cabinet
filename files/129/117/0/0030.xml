THE WAR AGAINST CRIME IN ENGLAND AND WALES1959 - ^96k
introduction.     It is time to take stock of developments over the past fiveyears in crime, the prevention and detection of crime, and thetreatnent   of offenders, and to look again into the future.2.     Early in 1959 the Government published a White Paper entitled&quot;Penal Practice in a Changing Society&quot; (Cmnd. 62+5) .      It was thefirst general analysis and review of the post-war situation.     Itdealt with the growth of crime and the weapons against crime.It was avowedly designed to &quot;serve, in some measure, as a chart bywhich we can plot our course in administering our penalinstitutions in the years that lie immediately ahead of us.3.     But it foreshadowed a deeper inquiry.     &quot;A fundamentalre-examination of penal methods,&quot; it said, &quot;based on studies ofthe causes of crime, or rather of the factors which cause orinhibit crime, and supported by a realistic assessment of theresults achieved by existing methods, could be a landmark inpenal history and illumine the course ahead for a generation,&quot;I+.     In 1959 it was, &quot;by common consent, too early to put thatfundamental re-examination in hand.     Results of important researchstudies could not for some years he expected to &quot;become available,and the post-war constructional programme in the penal field wasbut newly under way.Five eventful years have passed since then.II - The increase in crime5.     At the time of the 1959 White Paper, crime had been increasing for over three years    the improvement between 1951and 1955 had proved short-lived.     The increase has continued;so too has the tireless search for still more effective ways ofdappling with it,
6.     The tctal number of indictable offences recorded by the policerose between 1953 and 1962 by U3 per cent.     The number of offences of breaking and entering rose by h-7 per cent, and the number of offences of violence against the person by 2+8 per cent.Convictions of indictable offences increased between 1958 and 1962by 39 per cent.     One-third of all those found guilty of indictableoffences each year are under the age of 17? and one-half are under21.     Two-thirds of those found guilty of breaking and enteringoffences are under 21 ,7.     Some part of the increase in the number of known crimes isprobably due to the strengthening of police forces, readierreporting by the public, and better recording by the police.     but even so the actual volume of crime has increased substantially.The criminal statistics as hitherto compiled do not enable it tobe measured and analysed as accurately as could be wished;    our knowledge of the precise incidence and gravity of crime istherefore incomplete.     To remedy this, the Home Secretary ir 1963appointed a committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Wilfred Perks,&quot;to consider and report what changes, if any, are desirable in existing arrangements in England and Wales for the recording and reporting, for statistical purposes, of information about criminaloffenoes and proceedings, and about non-criminal proceedings inmagistrates&apos; courts and in the collection and presentation of statistics relating to these matters&quot;.     This committee, which includes members with wide experience of the compilation and useof criminal statistics, is at work on its important task.
III - The war against crimeThe Police8.     The latest developments in crime prevention and. detectionare &quot;being harnessed to the drive against crimes which are&quot;becoming more complex year by year, and against criminals whouse new techniques and often a high degree of organisation,,Detailed information about the work of the police and theprogress of police methods is published annually in the Reportsof Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectors of Constabulary and the Commissionof Police of the Metropolis.,9o     The Royal Commission on the Police recommend in its first report, in I960, a substantial increase in. the pay of constables0The Government accepted this recommendation, and the immediate result has been a marked and continuing improvement in recruiting,,At the end of I960 there were 69,932 policemen in England andWales;    on 31st December 1963 there were 0    the net increase of in police strength since I960 has beeninvaluable, and the majority of provincial forces all over thecountry are now up to strength;   but in London and other large cities, where the competitive attractions of other employment arehighest and wastage is heavy, many more police are still needed^The Home Secretary has declared that nothing would do more to staythe crime wave than the addition of a further 10,000 to policestrength throughout England and Wales10,   The increase in the number of police has been accompaniedby a review of establishments, to meet increasing crime and traffic needs0    The caseload of detective officers remainsvery heavy, but the strengthening in manpower has made it possible for many forces to allocate additional officers todetective work    There has also been a considerable rise in/the number of
the number of civilians engaged on police work, and in newoffice equipment and other aids to efficiency.    Together,these measures enable an increasing proportion of police timeto be spent on the primary task of prevention and detection of crime.   The amount of attention the police have &quot;been able togive to the regulation of traffic and the enforcement of the traffic laws has also increased steadily, as improved manpowerhas been reflected in the employment of more men in trafficdepartments and on the beat.   A good beginning has also beenmade in the use of traffic wardens (first introduced at theend of I960) who aid the police in dealing with parking offencesand certain other duties,   A further increase in the number ofwardens and their introduction on a wider scale outside Londonare being planned,11.     Following on the Final Report of the Royal Commission, theHome Secretary presented in November 1963 the Police Bill now before Parliament,   The traditional threefold partnership of theSecretary of State, the police authorities and the service itselfwill remain, but the balance within the partnership is re-adjusted.Under the new powers proposed for him, the Secretary of State willbe able to ensure the effective co-ordination of the work ofpolice forces and in a variety of other ways to improve efficiency and satisfy himself that it is maintained,12,     Other changes recommended, by the Royal Commission havealready been made, without need for legislation,   A ChiefInspector of Constabulary has been appointed, together with two additional Inspectors;    and two more are to be appointed in thecurrent year.   New regional offices have been established for the inspector, and staff officers and additional secretarial assistance have been provided, to enable the Inspectors to play an increasingly active part.   They will be the channel through which the Home Secretary can give a strong central lead at all times to higher and higher efficiency,/13,   The increase in
13.     The increase in the complexity of crime and the methods ofcriminals has accentuated the importance of research into methodsof policing and equipment.    In 1963 a Police Research and PlanningBranch was established in the Home Office , under the direction ofthe Chief Inspector of Constabulary.    One of its first tasks is to concentrate on means of combating the growing volume of serious and unsolved crime, particularly through the development of regional crime squads.lh.     The general quality of recruits for the police service is good.    It is, of course, essential to attract into the police service men capable of becoming the senior officer of the future.As part of a major re-crganisation of the higher training of thepolice, young men of outstanding ability are now to be eligible,after three years service as a constable, to compete for places ina new special one-year course at the Police College.    Successfulcompletion of the course carried with it automatic promotion;    andthis opportunity of accelerated promotion will help to attractmore recruits of high quality.    In addition officers of the rank of Inspector or above now have the opportunity of competing forselection for a new senior staff course at the College of sixmonths&apos;  duration.   By this means outstanding officers serving inthe middle ranks are equipped for the highest posts in the police service,15.     Equipment and technical aids of all kinds are being improved.The programme of new buildings required to improve operational efficiency has been greatly expanded;    expenditure for this purpose,which was  1,200,000 in 1958-9, has risen to  5,000,000 this year.Substantial progress has also been made in providing modernhousing for policemen and their families./The ^ ,co^-operation of tjie coramuriity
The co-operation of the community16.   Effective prevention of criminal behaviour requires a jointeffort by all social agencies - statutory and voluntary - and indeed by the whole nation.     Accordingly in February 1959* onthe day of publication of &quot;Penal Practice in a Changing Society&quot;,the then Home Secretary convened a conference of church leaders and others prominent in public life and in voluntary service to the community, to consider how they could help to combatdelinquency and improve by positive measures the moral health of the nation.     Another conference, of a more widely representative kind, took place in November 1961, which led tofurther discussions with representatives of the churches aboutthe ways in which their members might help.      Since then, twolocal conferences on the problem of juvenile delinquency have beenheld, in Leeds and Preston.     They stimulated active localinterest in the problem and in the need for co-operation between public and voluntary services in meeting it, and both resultedin the establishment of representative committees to study thefacts of delinquency in the area and the best ways of usinglocal resources against it.17.    The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotlandhave recently taken the initiative in appointing a strong andwidely based Advisory Committee on Juvenile Delinquency &quot;toconsider and advise on the problems of juvenile delinquency andon measures for its reduction51.     Taking the chair at its firstmeeting on 17th February 196h, the Home Secretary said:-/&quot;The formation
&quot;The formation of this committee is an experiment.With your help I mean to make it a dynamic experiment.We have had many official inquiries and advisory committeeshere at the Home Office, hut this is the first where theHome Secretary has taken the chair himself in order todiscuss the problems regularly face to face with people from all parts of the country who have valuable first-hand knowledge of them.There is another purpose I want this committee toserve.    Through it I want you to see the accumulatedknowledge and the resources of all Government Departmentsfocused on these problems of delinquency. I am sureyou will agree that the home and the family and thepersonality, the school, work or the lack of it,housing conditions and other local facts, all have tobe taken into account in striving to reduce delinquency.Our primary concern in this committee will be withthe reasons why boys and girls go wrong, and what canbe done about it, rather than with the methods of punishment after they have committed offences.At each meeting we will put before you for discussionpapers and proposals on different aspects of thesepuzzling problems.   We shall make available to you allthe information we have, and welcome your suggestions.A great deal of research is going on, in the Home Officeand elsewhere;   we shall tell you about it and get youradvice about priorities.The extent of delinquency in this country and many other countries is a disgrace to our modern age.   But itis not enough to condemn it;   we must be sure we under-stand the causes of it.&quot;/lb. The Government
18.    The Government attaches special importance to theextension of the powers of local authorities in the preventivefield made by section 1  of the Children and Young Persons Act1963, which came into force on 1st October 1963.     This make sit a duty of every county council and county borough council&quot;to make available such advice, guidance and assistance asmay promote the welfare of children by diminishing the need to receive children into or keep them in care ... or to bringchildren before a juvenile court&quot;.     The section also empowersa local authority to make arrangements for the provision ofany of these services by voluntary organisations.     Localauthorities are already doing preventive work:    the expressstatutory authority now given will assist its continued expansion and development.IV - Administration of JusticeThe Streatfeild Committee Report19*    The 1959 White Paper recorded the appointment of acommittee under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Streatfeild to review the arrangements for bringing to trial persons chargedwith criminal offences, and for providing the courts withthe information necessary to enable them to select the most appropriate treatment for offenders.     The Committee reportedin 1 96152.      In Part A of their report they made recommendations to secure that no one should normally have to wait more thaneight weeks after committal for trial.     These proposals wereimplemented by the Criminal Justice Act 1962.      Part B of theReport was concerned with the supply of information aboutoffenders to the courts to enable them to decide upon the mostsuitable forms of treatment.     The Committee&apos;s recommendationsaimed to secure that courts are given full information about/thexReport of the Interdepartmental Committee on the Businessof the Criminal Courts (Cmnd. 1289)
the background of offenders by those best qualified to supplyit, that the various reports are co-ordinated, and that theyare submitted in time to ensure that, wherever possible,sentence follows immediately on conviction.     The recommendationshave been brought into effect by Home Office circulars.20.    The Committee also recommended that &quot;all who have responsibility for passing sentence should be systematicallyprovided with a booklet giving comprehensive information, forevery form of sentence, about what it involves, what it is designed to achieve and what it in fact achieves, together with information about research into the result of sentences&quot;.     Thefirst edition of such a booklet is about to be issued by theHome Office.The -powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal21.    Ever since 1907 the possibility of empowering the Court of criminal Appeal to order a new trial in appropriate   cases hasbeen a matter of controversy.     Widely differing views have however been expressed about the case for making a change inthe law, and about the form which any change should take.     TheGovernment in the present session of Parliament has brought forward a Bill to empower the Court of Criminal Appeal to order a new trial where fresh evidence is submitted to it which appearsto justify this course;    and it is hoped that this will become law shortly.V - The criminal law22..    The White Paper of 1959 referred to the need to ensure thatcriminals do not escape punishment because of defects in the criminal law, and announced the appointment of a StandingCommittee on Criminal Law Revision under the chairmanship ofLord Justice Sellers.     The committee have already submittedreports, accompanied by draft Bills, on indecency with children:suicide:    the order of speeches in criminal proceedings:    theprocedure for dealing with persons found insane when brought/before
before the Courts on a criminal charge:    and the continuance ofa trial where a member of the jury dies or is for any reasondischarged.     Two of the draft Bills have reached the statute book, as the Indecency with Children Act I960, and the SuicideAct 1961.     The third, dealing with the order of speeches in criminal proceedings, is the subject of a Bill now beforeParliament;    and the report containing the fourth - the criminal procedure (insanity) Bill - is under consideration.     TheCommittee is completing its work on the law of larceny:    thelaw relating to perjury:    and the law concerning the attendance of witnesses at criminal trials.23o    The work of the Criminal Law Revision Committee is one part,and one part only, of the task of bringing the criminal law upto date.     Parliament itself has teen engaged on a large scale in modernising old legislation not sufficiently related topresent-day needs.     In the past five years the Street OffencesAct 1959, the Betting and Gaming Act i960, and the Licensing Act1961 have all been enacted, each of them making major changes inold legislation which had become unacceptable and difficult toenforce.     In addition, a Departmental Committee is sittingunder the chairmanship of Lord Crathorne to enquire intothe law relating to Sunday Observance.VI - Research2h-    Criminological research is essential to the battle againstcrime.      It is necessary to obtain a better understanding of thenature of criminality:    to study statistics and the realitieswhich lie behind them:    to examine crime in detail and to evolveways of accurately describing and measuring it.     The social andpsychological aspects of criminality must be investigated.Delinquent behaviour must be studied in the framework of normalbehaviour in order to increase understanding of its causes.Ways of preventing crime must be explored, and experimentscarried out to test them.     The effects on offenders of differentsentences and of the different ways in which treatment can becarried out within the penal system, must be examined.
25.   At the time of the 1959 White Paper, consideration was&quot;being given to the establishment of an Institute of Criminologyat Cambridge.      In 1960 the Institute was established, with the help of a generous grant from the Wolfson Foundation.     TheVfolfson Professorship of Criminology was created, and is heldby Professor Leon Radzinowicz, the Director of the Institute.These developments mark a most important advance in the study and teaching of criminology.     Besides carrying out a programmeof research, the Institute conducts post-graduate courses incriminology, and has held advanced vacation courses incriminology for persons working in the field of delinquency,26.    In other ways also the amount and intensity of research on delinquency and the treatment of offenders has greatlyincreased in the last few years.      The Home Office ResearchUnit now has a staff of 23 qualified research workers, with appropriate supporting staff.     A list of its completed reports and of the studies in which it is at present engaged is given inAppendix A.     Home Office grants for criminological research work in universities have increased to more than  50,000 a year.Appendix 3 gives a list of the reports completed, and the worknow in hand, with the assistance of these grants.27.    It must be emphasised that even with those enhancedresources, rapid progress cannot be expected.     Research projects in this field are inevitably complex and take time to complete;and there is a nationwide shortage of well qualified personswishing to engage in scientific criminological research.28.   Following the second conference mentioned in paragraph 12above, the Independent Television Authority offered to financeresearch into the impact of television on society, withparticular reference to its effect on the young.     This offer was gladly accepted, and the Home Secretary in 19^3 appointed a committee under the chairmanship of the Vice Chancellor ofLeicester University, Mr, T. A. F. Noble,/&quot;to initiate
&quot;to initiate and co-ordinate research into the part whichtelevision plays or could play, in relation to otherinfluences, as a medium of communication and in fosteringattitudes, with particular reference to the ways in whichyoung people&apos;s moral concepts and attitudes develop andthe processes of perception through which they areinfluenced by television and other media of communication;and to administer any funds made available to it for suchresearch&quot;.29.    To co-ordinate research activities and to bring in outsideexperience from different fields in planning future research,the Home Secretary has invited a number of leading researchworkers to form, with representatives of the Home Office,a new committee to advise him on criminological research.VI1 &quot; The Treatment of OffendersChanges in the law30.    Since 1959 important changes have been made in the powersavailable to the cou.rts for dealing with young offenders.     the criminal Justice Act 1961  raised the maximum fines for juvenileoffenders;    reduced the minimum age for attendance at anattendance centre from 12 to 10;    changed the period andconditions of after-care for boys and girls released fromapproved schools:   authorised the temporary removal of unrulyor subversive pupils, and the transfer to borstal of those who cannot benefit from approved school training or interfere withthe training of others;    and empowered the Home Secretary togive directions on the management of approved schools, and toregulate the constitution of voluntary managing bodies.     these provisions came into force on 2nd October 1961.31.   The Act of 1961 reduced from 16 to 15 the minimum age atwhich a sentence of borstal training can be imposed.     This was brought into force on 1st August 19&amp;3.      The Children and YoungPersons Act 1963 provided for the raising of the age of criminal/responsibility
responsibility from 8 to 10, and for many other changes in thelaw relating to delinquent children.     Most of these new provisions came into force on 1st February 196h.32.   The Criminal Justice Act 1961 established the borstalsystem as the principal form of medium-term institutionaltreatment for offenders between the ages of 17 and 21, and for those aged 15 and 16 who are not considered suitable for committalto an approved school.     On 1st August 1 963 imprisonment foroffenders under 17 was abolished.     Imprisonment for those aged17 to 21 is now in general restricted to sentencer of up to sixmonths or more than three years.     Eventually detention in a detention centre will entirely replace short sentences of imprisonment for this age group;    the Act accordingly containsprovision for the abolition by order of sentences of imprisonmentof up to six months.Preventive detention33.    The 1959 White Paper foreshadowed a review of the sentence of preventive detention.     This has since been carried out bythe Home Secretary&apos;s Advisory Council on the Treatment of offenders.      In a report published in 1963 the Councilrecommended that preventive detention should be abolished, andthat the courts should be empowered to impose longer sentences of imprisonment on certain types of persistent offenders. 1The Council also made recommendations about the type of prisonregime and after-care suitable for persistent offenders.These proposals are receiving consideration;    to implementthem would require amendments of the law.3h.    As an interim measure, the Council recommended abolition ofthe system by which selected preventive detention prisoners were released after serving two-thirds of their sentence, whereas theremainder had to serve five-sixths.      They proposed that all should be eligible, like ordinary prisoners, for release after two-thirds.     This change was made last year by an amendmentof the Prison Rules./Probation
Probation35-   A thorough review of the present service was made by theDepartmental Committee on the Probation Service under theChairmanship cf Sir Ronald Morison, Q,.C,, whose reports were published in March and August 1962 (Cmnd. 1650 and 1800).Many of the Committee&apos;s recommendations have already been implemented.     Salaries are being raised substantially,  in three stages concluding on 1st December I96I1, to the new levelsrecommended by the Committee.     A Probation Advisory andTraining Board has been constituted on the lines proposed, withthe Vice-chancellor of Leicester University as independent chairman.36.    The number of students in training was increased byone-third during 1963.     Probation students&apos; grants have been improved.     Pour additional probation inspectors have beenappointed, to enable more frequent inspections to be made andto carry out the extended programme of recruitment and training.The strength of the service has increased from 1,600 at tho endof 1958 to over 2,000;    this was the figure proposed as a firsttarget by the Morison Committee.     The intention is to hit thesecond target (2,750) during 1966.     The Administration ofJustice Bill now before Parliament gives effect to therecommendation that responsibility for the probation service in London should he transferred from the Secretary of State toa Probation Committee composed of representatives of the courts.Institutional Treatment37. -A detailed description of recent developments relating tojuveniles will he found in the triennial Report of the Children&apos;department of the Home Office and in the forthcoming report ofthe Prison Department.38.    In i960 the Home Office launched a large-scale building programme for approved schools in order to provide more places and to continue the much-needed modernisation and improvementof many existing schools.     Expenditure on these purposes has/risen
risen from   in 1958-9 to   - in the current year..The object is to provide &quot;by 1966 some 2,000 more places than wereavailable in 1958 - an increase of about 25/&apos;.     The central council for Child Care has undertaken responsibility for organising the training of approved school and remand home staff.39.    Good progress has also been made with the provision by localauthorities of more places in remand homes.     Since 1958 remandhome places have increased by       %,Prison Service Establishments1+0.    On 1st April 1963 the functions of the Prison commission were transferred to the Home Secretary.     A Prison department was established in the Home Office, where its work is closelyintegrated with that of other Departments concerned with the study and treatment of delinquency,1+1 .    There was a continuing rise in the population of prison service establishments (remand centres, detention centres,borstals and prisons) from 20,800 in 1956 to 32,000 in March1963.      Prom March 1963 it fell to 29,100 in December 19^3, butby the end of February 196k had risen again to 29s900.     TheGovernment announced in the Y/hite Paper of 1 959 a massivebuilding programme in which priority would be given to the needsof the young offenders.      The increase in the capital expenditureon prison service&apos;establishments from  822,000 in 1958/59 to 6,935,000 proposed for I96I+/65 shows the scale of the effort which is being made.      Since the publication of the White Paper,27 new establishments have been opened, and the impetus of theprogramme of building, adaptation and reconstruction is being fully maintained.I42.    The first remand centre was opened in 1961 .     Eight furthercentres, which should be sufficient to cover the whole of Englandand Wales, are under constrxiction.43.    Detention centres have been increased in number since 1959from four to fifteen, including one for girls.     The centres for senior boys (aged over 17 and under 21) have a capacity of about,800 inmates a year, on the basis of the usual sentence of/three
three months, and the centres for junior boys (aged over iJLj. andunder 17) an annual capacity of about 900.     Measures for further expansion are in hand.kk*    Five new borstals for boys, accommodating about 1 ,000, havebeen built since 1959, and one for girls.     Two further borstals,one with 300 places for boys and one with 80 places for girls,are being provided.     The number of offenders under 21  sentenced to imprisonment has fallen as a result of Section 3 of the criminal Justice Act 1961, but among the young prisoners&apos;centres available for this class is one opened since 1959*l\5&apos;    Establishments for adult offenders opened since 1959 includefour new open prisons for men and one for women:    a semi-secureprison for women, at Styal in Cheshire:    a psychiatric institutionwith sections for both sexes, at Grendon near Aylesbury:    and a secure prison for men, at Blundeston in Suffolk, built to anentirely new design.     Five further prisons to a similar designare under construction or planned for sites already settled, andalso a further semi-secure prison for women.      Because of the priority which has been given,  in buildings and staff, to young offenders, and the rise in the prison population, overcrowdingin closed local prisons persists, although the number of mensleeping three to a cell has fallen from 8,600 at its peak a yearago to little over 6,000 now.      The new prisons under constructionreferred to above, will relieve this overcrowding, whether they provide directly for men or release for men&apos;s use accommodation at present occupied by young offenders or by women;   but stillmore provision is required, and sites for further newestablishments accommodating about q.,000 are being sought.h6.   Excellent progress has also been made with the recruitment and training of the necessary prison staff;    the strength of theservice has risen from in 1958 to a total of hire&apos;    These developments have laid foundations for furtheradvances in the treatment of adult offenders.     The outstandingobjects of the Home Secretary now are to implement the proposalsof the Advisory Council on Employment for Prisoners and so enable/prisoners
prisoners in the local prisons to do something more like a fullweek&apos;s work;    to eliminate the necessity for prisoners to sleepthree in a cell:    to improve still further the training facilitiesfor long-term prisoners:    to develop the hostel system which helpsthe transition of long-term prisoners from detention to freedom:&quot;and to establish on a comprehensive basis a sound system ofafter-care.VIII - After-care2+8.    The Criminal Justice Act 1961 provided for a considerableextension of compulsory after-care.     The Home Secretary hasalready extended it, as from 1st January 1 962+, to personsreleased from detention centres.     He also asked the AdvisoryCouncil on the Treatment of Offenders to review the arrangementsfor the organisation of statutory and voluntary after-care for persons discharged from prisons, borstals, detention centres and approved schools.      In their report published in October 1963the majority of the Council recommended that after-care in thecommunity should be undertaken by an expanded and reorganisedprobation and after-care service, making full use of the help of voluntary workers, and that the social workers who are concernedwith the welfare of persons in custody and with their preparation for release should become members of the prison service.2+9.    The Home Secretary announced on 3rd December 1963 theGovernment&apos;s acceptance of these important and forward-lookingproposals.      The Council themselves recognised that theirimplementation must extend over a period of years.     Time willbe needed to recruit and train the necessary staff;   and theremust be close consultation with the many bodies - probationcommittees,  local authorities,  staff associations, voluntary organisations and others - whose co-operation will be essential for the success of this new venture.     It may well be necessary,as the Council contemplate, to introduce the new arrangementsarea by area as soon as local circumstances allow.50.   The Council pay a tribute, in which the Government are glad to join, to the part v^hich has hitherto been played by voluntary/effort
effort in the field of after-care and rehabilitation of offenders.They emphasise that it is essential for the success of their proposals that probation and after-care officers should havethe help of trained voluntary workers, and they hope to seeencouragement and expansion of the contribution made byreligious bodies and voluntary organisations - for example,by work with prisoners&apos; families, and by provision of clubsfor the lonely and hostels for the homeless or for those whootherwise need the support of a residential institution,perhaps for a long period after their release.   The Governmentcordially shares the Council&apos;s views on these matters, and inparticular on the importance of the general public understandingmore fully the part which they can play in the rehabilitation of offenders.IX - Tine for a Fundamental Review51.   Are our existing penal methods producing good enoughresults?   Pew would answer &quot;yes&quot; to that question with fullassurance.   To take but one instance, the falling success rateof boys coming out of approved schools must give ground for concern - and the reason for it may be partly that the devotedmanagers and staffs of the schools are having to deal with boysand girls who are less responsive to training than they use tobe,5-2.   Are we doing enough to devise and experiment with new methods of treatment?   Are we concentrating overmuch on seeking to improve the traditional methods?   To these questions there isno simple answer, but in the present upsurge of crime anddelinquency they ought to be asked,53.   Moreover, are the traditional methods closely enough linkedtogether?   In the case of the young a variety of treatments hasbeen developed separately, under different auspices.   Is thisdispersion a good thing, or not?   Probation is the responsibilityof the magistrates;    attendance centres of the State, actingmainly through the police:    remand homes of the local/authorities:
authorities:    detention centres of the State, acting throughthe Prison Department of the Home Office:    approved schoolspartly of the local authorities and partly of voluntarymanagers:    borstals of the State.   All of these now have a long enough history to be worthy of stocktaking inquiry by an objective and authoritative body which can form an overall view.5U*   The fundamental review of the whole penal system forwhich, in the Government&apos;s view, the time is now ripe is ofsuch importance and magnitude that it needs to be carried outby a Royal Commission.   There has been no comprehensive study of this kind since the Gladstone Committee of 1395.   A purpose will be to reassess the value of our penal system as it hasbeen built up until now - but much more than that.     With thatas the background, it is the time for a deep study of thephilosophy underlying the system - to determine afresh what we ought to be seeking to achieve, to examine how far and in what manner the results of our present practice fall short, and tosift new ideas in order to judge which of them appear bothconstructive and practicable in operation.55.   Her Majesty has approved the Government&apos;s recommendation toset up a Royal Commission with the following terms of reference:&quot;In the light of modern knowledge of crime and its causes and of modern penal practice here and abroad, to re-examinethe concepts and purposes which should underlie the punishment and treatment of offenders in England and Wales:to report how far they are realised by the penalties and methods of treatment available to the courts, and whether any changes in these, or in the arrangements and responsibility for selecting the sentences to be imposed on particular offenders, are desirable:    to review the workof the services and institutions dealing with offenders,and the responsibility for their administration:    and tomake recommendations&quot;,/It will
It will survey the whole field, but it will be asked to give priority to offenders under 21 and their treatment.   A high proportion of adult criminals have been juvenile delinquents.Therefore every improvement we can achieve in the handling ofthe young offender is of value in the war not only againstjuvenile delinquency but against adult crime.X - Conclusion56.   To sum up, a study has been initiated of the criminalstatistics - the means whereby the incidence and gravity of crime are measured.   Research into the causes of crime and the effectiveness of the means of dealing with the criminals is going ahead.   The modernisation of the criminal law, with the help of the Criminal Law Revision Committee and other bodies, isbeing pressed onward.   The police service has been greatly strengthened, and the enlarged Inspectorate and the new PoliceResearch and Planning Branch at the Home Office will enhancepolice efficiency for the dual task of preventing crime anddetecting offenders.   A new committee under the Home Secretary1schairmanship will bring together for regular practical discussiona wide-ranging body of people with first-hand experience of theproblems of young misbehaviour.   A Royal Commission will undertake a fundamental review and reassessment of our penalsystem.   All this will in no way hold up the steady improvements in staffing and in buildings which are now going on.   Taken alltogether, it represents a comprehensive and formidable armouryfor fighting the war against crime.

I96I, and analysis of deaths initially recorded by thepolice as murders and of the types of victim and murderer, withspecial attention to the effect of the changes made by theHomicide Act 1957.5.     &quot;Persistent Criminals&quot;, Report No, 5 in the Home Officeseries of Studies in the Causes of Delinquency and the Treatmentof Offenders.    (H.M.S.0. February, 1963), on the criminalhistories of all men who were liable to preventive detention in1956 and on the comparison between the characteristics of the/small
small proportion sentenced to preventive detention and those of others who received sentences varying from discharge to long-term imprisonment.   It also tries to relate a number of social and personal factors to preventive detainees&apos; chances of selection for hostel places and early release, and to theirprogress after serving their sentence.60     The Home Office Research Unit has also completed research -and its results may shortly be published - on the criteria bywhich problem families are selected as such by the LondonCounty Council.Current research .     Probation ResearchThis has been divided into five sub-projects as follows:-(i)   A study of Criteria of Successful Treatment ofOffendersThe majority of research projects involving evaluationof treatment have considered the subsequent behaviour of offenders only in terms of further convictions.   The purposeof this study is to check whether such criteria are adequate or whether a better measuring instrument isrequired which will, if possible,  give a scale of degrees of success of the outcome of treatment,(ii)   Prior-probabilities Study (Prediction)The object is to estimate probabilities of recidivismin respect of individual offenders,(iii)   Operational research the object is to study modifications of the presenttechniques of probation case work.(iv)    Classification of OffendersThe object is to assist the selection of treatment for offenders by providing data on the varying responsesto particular types of treatment of different classes ofoffendersa
(v)   Types of treatment on probationThe object is to identify and describe different types of probation treatment so that these may be related to types of offenders (sub-project iv), with a view to finding the most effective forms of treatment for particular types.2.     Research on Apprpvedi schools the object is to investigate the effects of various kinds of training on different &quot;^ypes of offenders;    the followingprojects have been started:(i)   A statistical reconviction study, based on a follow-upof the whole 1956 intake;(ii)   A study of vocational training;(iii)   A study of the development of an approved schoolhostel;(iv)   A study of staff conceptions of the approved schoolsyst em;(v)   A study, in collaboration with the psychologists onthe staffs of classifying schools, of methods of diagnosison which recommendations for treatment may be made.3.     General studies of criminal histories and the effectiveness of different treatmentsThe main aims are:    (i) to study criminal careers andpatterns of offending at all stages with special reference topredicting the continuance of criminality;    (ii) if possibleto establish norms (i,e. assessments of vulnerability to subsequent reconviction) of different offender groups;    and(iii) to study methods of analysing biographical data.   Theinformation, obtained under (i) and (ii), together with socialinformation, is being used to predict the number of reconvict ionsto be expected from the nature of the offenders whatever sentencethey are given;    the actual numbers reconvicted following anysentence are then compared with the expected numbers in order to/assess
n n aassess whether the particular sentence results in fewer or morereconvictions than could be expected from the types of offenderconcerned.The material being used for these studies includes:    (a)all Scottish first offenders in 1947,&apos;    (b) all offenders recordedat the Criminal Record Office as committing an offence in theMetropolitan Police Division during March or April 1957;    (c)all offenders liable to preventive detention in England andWales in 1556;    (d) juvenile offenders in the Metropolitan areaborn in 1946;    (e) all offenders liable to preventive detentionin 1956.(!)   Three studies on.first offenders have now beencompleted:(a) a comparison of English and Scottish Offenders;(b) a comparison of treatments given to juveniles;and(c) a comparison of treatments given to adults,(2)   Studies of female offenders(i)   A study of the female offenders in theMetropolitan area, with special reference to the incidence of crime at different ages;    this study also included a five year follow-up of those sentenced in 1957*(ii)   Women discharged from prisons and borstalsA study of women prisoners and borstals detaineesdischarged in 1953. with particular reference to the factors affecting reconviction.4.     Studies of treatment in particular types of institutionThe following studies are in progress:(i)    Comparative Study of Offenders Serving First and second Prison SentencesThe object is to predict recidivism from the factors which differentiate the two groups. -
A pilot investigation into changes in prisoners&apos;social attitudes during their sentence at Pentonville.(iii)   Research into the effectiveness of Prison HostelSchemesThe research has started with an analysis of informa-tion already recorded about men who have been in hostelsand about those who were eligible but not chosen forhostels.   Work record as well as absence of reconvictionis being considered as a measure of success.(iv)   Manchester Senior Attendance.. Centre:    study of thefirst three years&apos;&apos;intake with a follow-up after one a study of the types of boy sent to the centre, oftheir subsequent convictions, and of the possibility ofestablishing a prediction formula for use with subsequentintakes.Other studies(i)   Study of the criteria of successful treatment of offenders ( see&apos; a&apos;l&apos;so&quot;&quot;i&apos;(&apos;i&quot;)i above)&quot;&quot;Two approaches are being made;    one is to find outhow far the objectives of those responsible for varioustreatments are achieved, so that, if possible, a scale ofdegrees of success of the treatments can be produced;    thesecond is to assess the offender&apos;s social adjustment withspecial reference to his stability in employment beforeand after treatment,(ii)   National Survey of Child Health and Development( see alsj^Ajgpjsndix-IT)The Research Unit is participating in the NationalSurvey of Child Health and Development by Dr. Douglas ofthe London School of Economics.   In an attempt to findcauses of delinquency by contrasting delinquents with others, information is being obtained about delinquentsyear/from
from amongst a sample of about 5,000 children born inthe first week in March 191+6, of whom records have been kept from birth,(iii)   Prediction FormulaeA Study of data relating to borstal boys and youngprisoners, to see what predictions can be made for allthese boys jointly and to what extent these may be modified by the form of treatment that they were given.Nev/ methods of analysis of the data, includingmethods devised at Southampton University by ProfessorWilliams and other methods developed within the Home OfficeResearch Unit, have been used, and promising results havebeen obtained.(iv)    Continuous prediction of Borstal BoysThis project was devised to make possible a continuous review of borstal prediction methods, showing what revision of the &quot;prediction tables&quot; was necessary andplotting changes in the sort of material received intoborstals.   Since 1958 information believe to be prognosticof the outcome of borstal training has been obtained aboutall boys passing through the Allocation Centres,   this information includes all items in the original predictiontable, and additional items which may in the future prove to be useful for prognosis,(v)   Polmont Borstal, Scotland a study of the attitudes of inmates to those aroundthem in collaboration with Professor F. Fielder of IllinoisUniversity.(vi)    Methods of reducing delays at Juvenile CourtsThis study is intended to show whether any simple yetscientifically based appointments system for the juvenile Courts would be workable, and, if so, whatbenefit could be expected from it.
