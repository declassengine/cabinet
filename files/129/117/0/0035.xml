Printed for the Cabinet.  April 1964CP. (64) 857th April, 1964CABINETINDUSTRIAL ACTION BY THE UNION OF POST OFFICE WORKERS:EFFECT ON POSTAL services memorandum by the Postmaster-general it has not so far been possible to reach agreement with the Union of PostOffice Workers on the treatment of their claim for increased pay for postmen.Efforts to do so continue.2. The Union has said that, failing agreement, it will call for industrial action as follows:(a) a nation-wide strike on Thursday, 16th April;(b) a ban on overtime and on all Sunday work from 17th April for at least two weeks; and(c) the withdrawal of goodwill for the same period this means &quot; working to rule &quot; or &quot; go slow &quot;.They have also said that they would review the situation at the end of two weeks.3. I expect that most of the men will respond to the Union&apos;s call. As I said inmy earlier paper on postmen&apos;s pay (CP. (64) 54) this will seriously affect the postal services. My colleagues will wish to know of the measures I propose to take.4. Overtime and Sunday work. I am satisfied that, at the start at any rate, weshould not attempt to compel postmen to do overtime and Sunday work in the face of a Union ban. This would quickly lead to mass walk-outs and bring the postal services to a halt over wide areas of the country. For the same reason I do not propose to seek help from servicemen and civilians. The right course, I am sure, isto reduce services to match the reduced staff working hours.5. Effects on Post Office services. Mail services will be at a standstill onApril 16th and on Sundays. On other days, it will not be possible to maintainnormal services anything like fully.6. My main concern will be to maintain the first-class letter service. To do this I propose to suspend, as from midnight 15th/16th April:(a) the inland parcel post;(b) the inland printed paper service; and(c) the house-to-house unaddressed delivery service.I shall also have to reduce and re-time deliveries and collections in many places.7.   Counter services will in general be unaffected.8. Statutory position in regard to suspension of services. I have full powerto suspend the house-to-house delivery service. In the case of parcels and printedpapers, however, there has always been a doubt as to how far their suspension wouldinfringe any implied obligations of the Postmaster-General, under the Post OfficeAct 1953 and the Regulations made under the Act, and so lay the Post Office opento legal action. But the view has been taken in the past that it would not be justifiable to forestall this by making Emergency Regulations, under the Emergency powers act 1920, even if such a course were intra vires, which is doubtful; and that ifnecessary there would have to be a Bill of Indemnity. I see no reason to take adifferent view now.J. R. B.General Post Office, E.C.7th April, 1964.Copy No.  9V t-s?4185
