THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. April 1964CP. (64) 65 Copy No.    5 21st April, 1964CABINETTHE PROSPECTS FOR TAXATION, 1964-67Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretaryto the Treasury and Paymaster general we have been trying to make a first estimate of the Budget problems of thenext four years. This is obviously of great practical and political importance, and wewould like to bring our conclusions to the attention of our colleagues.2. What emerges are the implications of the prospective growth of public expenditure. We warned our colleagues in general terms about this earlier in theyear (CP. (64) 3 and 8); but this is the first time we have been able to express itin specific budgetary terms.Growth of Expenditure3. The December 1963 White Paper on Public Expenditure (Cmnd. 2235)showed a 17i per cent increase of public expenditure at constant prices from1963-64 to 1967-68. Assuming a 4 per cent per annum rise in Gross national product (G.N.P.), this represented an increase in the ratio of public expenditure(excluding debt interest) to G.N.P. from the present 40 per cent to around 4H percent. This will be taking the ratio up from 36 per cent to which it fell in 1957&quot; and1958 to a higher level than it was when we came into power (40^ per cent) in fact tothe highest ever in peacetime.4. Since the White Paper was published the figures have been growing.Defence expenditure, on the present basis, is likely to be substantially more than was allowed for, with many more increases to come in the late 1960s. We have announced the raising of the school-leaving age; and the universities are asking forhuge increases in grants. We are discussing very expensive changes in national insurance. We have accepted the Channel Tunnel in principle.Size of Tax Increases5. Some calculations have been made of the receipts from taxation that wouldbe required to keep the economy in balance, with a reasonable growth in private investment and exports, given the rate of increase of public sector expenditure setout in the White Paper. In addition to the assumptions lying behind the white paper itself, it has been assumed that the present proportion of local government expenditure will continue to be financed from local rates and that increases in national insurance benefits will continue to be financed from contributions on thepresent basis. A crucial assumption concerns the likely rate of personal saving.This has been put as high as seems probable namely, that persons will save 20 percent of the addition to their real incomes over the period. Account has been taken of the fact that owing to the progressive nature of the income tax, and surtax,receipts from these taxes rise disproportionately as incomes rise.6. On these assumptions, the result of the calculations is that by 1967 it willbe necessary to have secured that the rates of taxes are increased, or the tax baseis widened, to the extent necessary to raise an additional  300- 400 million annually.4151
A &quot; Regular &quot; Tax Increase7. Thus, even if the economy is expanding at the full growth rate, the prospective growth of public expenditure implies that there will &quot; normally &quot; haveto be an annual increase in rates of taxation sufficient to produce an additional 75- 100 million. The precise extent of the tax changes required year by year will depend on the way the economy actually develops, and cannot be predicted inadvance. But it can be said that in any cyclical down-turn, when the stimulus of tax reductions may be required, the amount necessary will be lessened by the continuous upward movement in public expenditure; while if we find ourselves ina boom, the rising public expenditure will be feeding it further, so that the taxincreases required to correct it will be the greater.8. This prospect of a &quot; regular &quot; and &quot; normal &quot; increase in tax rates worth 75- 100 million a year would be an important change from the experience ofthe last 12 years, in which we have had an alternation of tax-reducing and no-changeBudgets; and only one substantial operation (1961) to raise tax rates.9. We have not tried to form a view on the political implications of this. Mostof our colleagues would probably agree that the present rates of taxation, direct and indirect, are not so onerous as to subject us to great pressure to reduce them (weare, of course, seeing the pressure on local rates). This subject is not inthe foreground.10. But a steady rise in tax rates, which is the most likely outcome for theGovernment during the next four or five years, could bring this to the front, and give rise to strong pressures, particularly from sectional groups which found themselves hit. Our experience on local rates is very significant, and may becometypical. We sometimes say that people are ready to accept higher rates of tax to pay for public expenditure but so far they have not had to make this choice; thegrowth of the burden has been disguised by the fact that we have been able toreduce the rates of direct personal taxation so frequently.Some Conclusions11. This is not the kind of situation that can be tackled by a few simple steps.At the moment, our purpose is to inform our colleagues of what the prospectseems to be.12. We have asked that thought should be given to the tax structure, to see whether changes could be made that would permit the yield to be increased withthe least political or economic damage; this means thinking also about local rates,and national insurance contributions, and charges for public services.13. At present, however, the dilemma seems clear: if we look to the indirecttaxes as the source of the increase, we shall have to face not only the effect on prices and the cost of living, with the adverse effect on incomes policy, but alsothe strong probability that we shall have to bring into taxation goods and servicesso far exempt in particular foodstuffs. If on the other hand we turn to direct taxation, we shall not only be reversing the policy we have followed since 1951,but it will be said and up to a point, with truth that we shall be damagingincentives and the mainsprings of risk-taking. Either way, the economic as well asthe political difficulties could be serious.14. In the end we must come back to the rate of growth of public expenditure,which is the root of the matter. However important these expenditures are defence,social services, housing, agricultural subsidies, etc. there must be an upper limit to what can be sustained, for it is the private sector, together with the nationalised industries, which have to provide the industrial and commercial investment, the exports, and the goods and services for privately financed consumption.R.
