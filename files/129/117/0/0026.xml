Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1964CP. (64) 76 Copy No.  5119th March, 1964CABINETEXPORT CREDIT COVER FOR CUBAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and regional development at their meeting on 3rd March, the Cabinet invited me, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, to settle the question of providing credit cover in respectof certain goods for which letters of intent had been issued by the Cuban TradeMission, and decided to resume later their discussion of the question of credit cover for further trade with Cuba (CM. (64) 16th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. In agreement with the Foreign Secretary, I authorised the Departmentto cover the business referred to above (amounting to some  1-6 million) on theunderstanding that the question whether the cover would be under Section 1 or section 2 of the Act should be settled after the Department^ Advisory Council had considered whether to give cover for Cuba under Section 1. This the AdvisoryCouncil have now done. They have informed me that they are willing to take Cubanbusiness on a commercial basis under Section 1 of the Act for cover up to thenormal period of five years. They propose to place a limit for firm business andoffers taken together of  4 million on annual repayments with discretion to extend this by up to    million in all if needed to relieve pressure in peak years.3. The Council appreciate that for reasons which would not concern them the Government might wish to impose a limit lower than that which they themselves would feel justified imposing. In that case they would expect the Government tomake it known that this was a Government decision and not one for which theCouncil were responsible.4. This is satisfactory. If the credit insurance is done on a purely commercial basis under Section 1 it will relieve us of embarrassment with the United states which arises from the wording of Section 2. The limit of  4 million a year is thesame as that proposed if we were to act under Section 2. This figure will not bepublished and will not be known to the United States. Nor does it follow that firmbusiness will be taken on up to this limit which must allow for offers which do not result in contracts, e.g., because the business is placed elsewhere. Thus since we last discussed this matter orders for locomotives worth some  4^ million have fallenout because the United Kingdom firms concerned have decided not to supply.5. The Advisory Council&apos;s recognition that the Government may want toimpose a lower limit than they would themselves think justified provides a safeguardin the last resort, but the fact of intervention could not be concealed. Once we fix a lower limit ourselves we are, it seems to me, in the same difficulty as if we were operating under Section 2. Unless these matters are decided on&apos; commercial considerations there is no firm basis for whatever figure we choose and no answer to the United States if they maintain that the limit should be zero. We shall be seen to have departed from the principle which we have hitherto maintained that, apartfrom strategic controls, we make no distinction on political grounds between thecountries with which we are willing to trade; and once any non-commercial limithas been reached the Government will come under heavy pressure on every case to go above it, since firms will know that in the opinion of the Advisory Councilit is commercially prudent to do so.4129THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
6. Accordingly, I ask my colleagues to agree that I should inform the export credits Guarantee Department that they can give cover for Cuba under Section Iin the normal way on the understanding that there will be an initial limit of 4 million on annual maturities, and that I shall wish to have the opportunity of considering carefully the political implications of any changes in.this limit whichthe Advisory Council may wish to make on commercial grounds over and abovethe small working margin proposed in paragraph 2.7. It would, of course, remain my intention to restrict publicity to theminimum.E. H.Board of Trade, S.W.1,19th March, 1964.
