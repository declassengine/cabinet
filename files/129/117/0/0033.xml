Printed for the Cabinet. A pril 1964CP. (64) $3 Copy No.     r6th April, 1964CABINETNATIONAL INSURANCE AND NATIONAL ASSISTANCE:FUTURE policy memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate this report as Chairman of the Committee on Pensions and national insurance.2. The Committee have considered in what directions we should develop our policy on benefits and assistance.Preferential benefits3. We are agreed in principle that future policy for national insurance should include provision for preferential benefit for older retirement pensioners; forinstance, those over 75. Survival to such an age creates for the survivorscontingencies for which it is proper for national insurance to make provision:increased dependence on others&apos; services, and reduced resources apart from pension.This change could be presented as an extension of the policy of giving preferentialbenefits in special circumstances which the Government have adopted in the caseof widowed mothers.4. The National Assistance Board (as such) have not yet been consulted; butwe think that preferential treatment for the aged could be justified in national assistance as well as in national insurance. In the case of national assistance similararguments can be advanced for extending a higher rate of assistance to youngerpeople, for example the chronic sick, who have to live on national assistance fora long time, but we think there would be difficulty in drawing the line.5. The best time to implement preferential benefits and assistance would bewhen a general increase in national insurance and national assistance rates wasbeing made. We should need to consider the details at the time, including the age at which the extra benefit would begin and its amount.Contracting out6. We are convinced that the present arrangements for a graduated retirement pension and for contracting out of it must be altered in due course because furthergeneral increases in benefits and contributions on the existing pattern would eventually produce serious inequities between one contributor and another.7. The graduated scheme in 1959 provided for the contracted out to payable flat contribution whatever their earnings. Those who took part in the scheme,on the other hand, paid a contribution compounded of two elements, one flat,and lower than that paid by the contracted out, the other rising with earnings between  9 and  15 (now  18) a week. The result was that those in the scheme with earnings at the bottom of this band paid less than did the contracted out forthe same benefit, while those with earnings at the higher end of the band paid morethan the contracted out in relation to their respective benefits. In other words,the contracted out with low earnings pay &quot; too much &quot;, and with high earnings&quot; too little &quot;, by comparison with those with the same earnings who are in the graduated scheme. This position would be made worse by any substantial increasein flat rate benefits and in the related contributions.4182a
8. So when benefits are raised again, we ought to mitigate the increase in contributions required of the contracted out with low earnings and make a correspondingly greater increase, in the contributions of those with higher earnings.9. The Minister of Pensions has put to us a suggestion which would do thiswhile preserving contracting out, which is an important provision for encouragingoccupational pension schemes. The essence of this plan is that everyone, even the contracted out, would pay the same graduated contributions and the contracting out would no longer relate to the graduated scheme as at present; instead, thefiat contribution would be abated for those contracted out and there would be acorresponding abatement of their total national insurance pensions, in considerationof occupational pension having been guaranteed for them as at present.10. This rearrangement would overcome the obstacles described inparagraph 7 to fresh increases in pensions and contributions. Further, by puttingeveryone on to the graduated contribution scale in respect of earnings of  9 ormore, it would provide a universal contribution base for a scheme of earnings-related unemployment and sickness benefit and widows&apos; allowances (at presentpaid for the first three months of widowhood). A universal base does not existat present because the contracted out pay flat contributions only.Unemployment, sickness and widowhood benefits related to earnings11. We have considered such a scheme. Where earnings are  9 or less a week,the benefits would be, as now, flat. On the next  9 a week they would produceon the full  9 the same sum again as was payable on the first  9. To go beyond this would incur the criticism that relatively greater benefit would go to the better-off. Allowances for dependants would continue as now. The effect is illustrated in Annex A, Table 1, which is based on the current levels of the benefits and shows how they would vary in size and in proportion of earnings.12. We should have to decide whether the scheme was to apply to unemployment only or to sickness and widowhood as well. The case for applyingit to unemployment is both social and economic; for sickness and widowhood it issocial only. Yet there would be difficulty in treating sudden drops in incomedifferently simply because the cause, although in each case outside the victim&apos;control, is different. For similar reasons it may be difficult to avoid acceding to pressure for transitional arrangements for persons reaching retiring age.13. We should need to think further about the details of any scheme. Inparticular we should have to decide how long the earnings-related benefit shouldbe paid. We have had in mind two alternatives. On the view that what is neededis to mitigate the sudden drop in income before adjustments can be made, paymentneed not continue beyond, say, three months. This would also encourage the redundant employee to seek another job without delay. The other view is that three months would be thought too short a period for sickness; and then it wouldbe even more difficult to limit payment for unemployment to less than the seven months which is the minimum period for flat-rate unemployment benefit; so thatseven months would seem a suitable period for both these benefits. These detailscan perhaps be considered later, but whatever period were chosen, the enormousnumber of claims for sickness benefit for short periods would overburden themachinery for employers and the Ministry if benefit had to be related to earnings from the outset. Because of this, sickness benefit should not be related to earningsfor the first month of sickness.14. On the merits of the principle of short-term benefits being related to earnings, views in the Committee are divided.15. On the one hand, the Minister of Labour strongly advocates the principle and its adoption as soon as possible. In his view:(a) Earnings-related unemployment benefit is essential to our policy of modernisation, and will reinforce our other measures to this end,including our training and retraining programme.ib) It will make an important contribution to improving industrial relations,carrying forward all our other efforts on this including the contracts of Employment Act.(c) We cannot have faster growth without the co-operation of workers, butfaster growth is bound to involve more redundancy.
(d) So long as redundancy means a sharp drop in income, there will be- continuing resistance to it on the shop floor and perpetuation of restrictive practices to avoid it. In particular, overmanning is a majorobstacle to progress. It is difficult to attack this frontally, butmanagement will be less reluctant to tackle the problem if we reduce the hardship of unemployment.\e) Earnings-related unemployment benefit is the best means of reducing thedrop in current income which affects all workers who lose their jobs,irrespective of length of service. Severance payments are also needed,however, for long service workers. These will give appropriatecompensation to the worker who has been in a regular and steady jobfor a long period, who will have come to expect his job to continue andloses it because of economic or technical change.(/) The employers have consistently pressed for earnings-related unemploymentbenefit, though they would like it confined to workers with a goodinsurance record. They have been opposed to legislation on severancepay, but in the light of recent developments the Minister of Labourbelieves that they might now be willing to accept a package consistingof both a statutory severance pay scheme and earnings-related unemployment benefit.(g) The Trades Union Congress also favour improvements in unemploymentbenefit, though they want a substantial increase in all flat-rate national insurance benefits as the first step. The Minister of Labour thinks thatthey too, while not making much show of welcome, might agree to apackage, though, unlike the employers&apos; representatives, they would want graduation extended to sickness benefit.(h) Genuine redundancies at present constitute only a minority of theunemployed. But they would constitute a bigger proportion if it werenot for resistance to change, and will increase as automation advances.It is in any case important to reduce the hardship of unemploymentffor workers in industries like construction, where job changes arefrequent. Otherwise they too will continue to have every incentive tospin out the work and postpone dismissal.(i) The Minister of Labour believes that earnings-related benefits would bea major factor in getting to the real root of many restrictive practices in industry, in facilitating industrial change and in getting workers&apos;co-operation in raising productivity. For these reasons he wants us to concentrate our effort on this as soon as possible.16. The Minister of Pensions adds that it would be in line with our modernpolicy of relating benefit as much as possible to need if we were to take accountof the special form of need created by sudden loss of income; and this would bedone by relating benefit to earnings in these circumstances.17.  On the other hand, Treasury Ministers are sceptical. In their view:(i) The proposal is not well-aimed; the greatest beneficiary proportionatelywould be the single man, who is already the most mobile, and shouldbe encouraged to be mobile, while disproportionate increases in hisunemployment benefit would be likely to work counter,to this, andtherefore operate against mobility of labour.(ii) It would be wasteful as a means of sweetening redundancy: of some3J million claims a year for unemployment benefit, many arose fromseasonal or casual work and only some 300,000 were genuineredundancies.(iii) It would be relatively costly to administer.(iv) Little reduction in the fear of redundancy, and little increase in the mobility of labour or reduction of restrictive practices, can be expected from a scheme which can only mitigate the fall in income on loss ofemployment.(v) Yet increased benefit might marginally reduce the eagerness of the greatnumbers of claimants to benefit, who include many beside the genuinelyredundant, to find fresh jobs.4182
(vi) We should be careful about adding to the cost of our industry, whosecompetitive position is not strong.(vii) There is no reason to believe that graduated short-term benefit would be popular either with employers or trade unions.Cost and timing18. The total expenditure on benefits and assistance under present policy andunder developments of policy of the kinds described above has an important bearing on the nature and timing of the developments of policy, and so on thedecisions that we have to make. This is because we ought to contain expenditureon benefits and assistance within the forecasts given in our White Paper on public expenditure (Cmnd. 2235) for 1967-68.19. At 1963 prices, that forecast is that by 1967-68 our expenditure onbenefits and assistance will rise by  360 million, assuming that rates of benefitare increased in line with real earnings per head and that there is no other changein the scheme.20. The annual cost of the scheme of earnings-related short-term benefits in 1967-68 lies between  20 million and  60 million, depending on the period forwhich the additional earnings-related benefit was paid and its coverage.21. The annual cost of preferential benefits for the very old (paragraphs 3-5above) would depend on detailed decisions. But assuming a 10s. differential (singlerate 16s. married) for retirement pensioners over 75, the annual cost wouldbe about  50 million.22. So, if we were to introduce earnings-related short-term benefit andpreferential benefit for the very old, we should exceed by some  100 million ourpublished forecast increase of  360 million in benefits and assistance. We couldonly keep within the  360 million if we offset the cost of the new benefits by not raising existing benefits generally in line with earnings. We could argue thatthe special increase for the aged justified a lower rate of increase than would otherwise have been possible for the general run of beneficiaries but we could hardly pray in aid the fact that savings were needed to finance graduatedshort-term benefits.23. If we are to contain this expenditure, the timing of benefit increases iscrucial. If we put the rates up as soon as the spring of 1965, the amount ofgeneral increase we could properly afford, in addition to earnings-related benefits and preference for the old, would be too small to be acceptable. Moreover, the pattern of three-yearly increases which prevailed until 1963, when we acted after two years only (incidentally, raising benefits by 17-4 per cent although earningshad risen in the period by only 7-2 per cent) would have been broken twice in succession to create a new pattern of biennial increases; and a further increase onthat pattern would be due in 1967, in Parliaments third year. If the 1965 increasewere 7s. 6d. (under 75) and 17s. 6d. (over 75) and the 1967 increase were on asimilar scale, expenditure in 1967-68 would be some  135 million above the forecast we have published for that year, including  50 million for the cost of earnings-related short-term benefits; and in terms of contributions the  135 million would imply heavy increases, for instance, an additional 50 per cent for the contracted-out man earning  18 a week. So we ought not to contemplate a general increase of benefit rates before, say, April 1966, or perhaps at the earliest the endof 1965.24. If, then, we wanted to start earnings-related short-term benefits in 1965,this would have to be a separate exercise. We should have to provide for it ina separate Bill to be passed by Christmas this year so that the necessarycontribution changes (paragraph 10 above) could be brought into effect inApril 1965. This would be awkward because the Bill would be improving thebenefits of the better-paid who fall sick or unemployed, but it would do nothing,after an interval of two years, for the lower-paid, the chronic sick and the pensioners who number 6 million and are the really big problem, financially and politically. Pressure for a general improvement would be strong and there would beopportunities for amendments in this sense. It must in any case be very doubtfulwhether, among our other preoccupations, we could settle all the detailed problems,both of policy and practice, in time to have a considered Bill on short-term benefitsthis year. If we decide this is not practicable, we cannot introduce the contributionchanges, which are tied to the tax year, until April 1966, and the earnings-related benefits correspondingly later.
25. Under the 1959 Act contribution rates are due to go up in April 1965,with no extra benefit, to meet the cost of the growing number of pensions. Theamounts of the increases can be reduced, but not extinguished, by Order. Therewould be some political advantage if improvements could be brought in at thesame time; but, if they cannot, the Minister of Pensions would prefer to actunder the law as it is rather than to introduce special legislation to defer the increases in contributions.26. Another consequence of increases in benefits must be borne in mind.National assistance will be increasingly limited by the reduced margin betweennational insurance benefit and the wage in the beneficiary&apos;s normal employment.This will bring pressure on us to help the larger families by making some increasein family allowances which have stood unchanged since 1956 (and may attractpressure for improvement on this account anyway). The cost of an increase inthe allowance for third and subsequent children from 10s. to 15s. a week wouldbe about  30 million a year. Our published forecast for 1967-68 contained no allowance for this.Conclusions27. The conclusion which Treasury Ministers draw from this is that weshould not attempt to legislate to increase benefits or to introduce earnings-related short-term benefits before April 1966 and that we should not in the meantimecommit ourselves to earnings-related short-term benefits.28. The Minister of Labour, on the other hand, considers that so strong acase exists on economic grounds for introducing earnings-related short-term benefitthat this should be done as soon as possible. He would like the additionalunemployment benefit to be payable for only three months; and he thinks that,despite the views of the Trades Union Congress (see paragraph 15 (g) above), itshould be possible to sustain a case for confining earnings-related benefit to unemployment, excluding sickness and bereavement, if the basis of our action were avowedly economic. On this basis the annual cost would be less than 20 million, if it proved possible to make this change in isolation. He considersthat this would be a relatively small price to pay for the economic advantages which he expects to result. But he envisages that industry would incur also thecost of a national severance payments scheme, estimated at  5-8 million a year.29. The Minister of Pensions agrees with the Minister of Labour that inprinciple earnings-related short-term benefits are desirable, but he considers that legislation should not be introduced until after April 1965. He believes that itwould be practicable to put through a general increase in all benefits in April 1966or late in 1965, which was somewhat below the amount needed to keep in line with the rise in earnings, provided that at the same time he could introduceboth differential benefit for the very old and the scheme for earnings-related short-term benefits. But in view of all that has been said recently about theconsideration being given to earnings-related benefit, he feels strongly that some indication of the Governments views must soon be given.30.  We seek the guidance of the Cabinet on the following questions:(a) Are we to contemplate introduction of differential benefit for the veryold when benefits are next generally increased?(b) Are we to contemplate introduction of earnings-related unemploymentbenefit? And earnings-related sickness benefit and widow&apos;s allowance?(c) Are we to contemplate either (a) or (b) taking effect as early as April 1965?(d) How far are we to commit ourselves in public on the substance and timing of (a) and (b)lR.
