Printed for the Cabinet. March 1964CP. (64) 7820th March, 1964CABINETFINANCE FOR UNIVERSITY EXPANSIONMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council and Minister for ScienceImmediately after the publication of the Robbins Report last October, wepublished our White Paper (Cmnd. 2165) in which we accepted the recommendations for the expansion of numbers in the universities down to 1967-68, and the calculations of demand and available entrants on which they were based. In this white Paper we stated that resources would be provided for the purpose and that&quot; capital and recurrent grants will be adjusted accordingly &quot;.2. The main increase in numbers falls on the existing universities, including those we have recently founded. The total population has to go up from 124,000 atthe start of the^academic year to 170,000 in 1967-68. The previous target, to whichthe earlier programme of capital grants was related, was 150,000 for a year earlier(1966-67).3. The University Grants Committee (U.G.C.) were asked last November toadvise, after consulting the universities, on the additional building that would be needed to reach the Robbins target. At first the universities put in bids totallingover  100 million and offers to expand by double what Robbins had proposed. TheU.G.C. scaled down these bids by reference to Robbins numbers, and in Januaryinformed me that so far as they had then been able to carry their enquiries it seemed that a ceiling of  55-60 million additional capital would be needed in 1964 and1965, and that they foresaw the need for substantial additional programmes beyond that.4. I discussed this situation with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, whopointed out that these proposals were greatly in excess of any figures mentioned inour discussions in October. We agreed that a decision on starts in 1965 and later years should be deferred until the U.G.C. had been able to examine all the universityproposals individually, and that in the meantime, in view of the time factor, startsto the value of  15 million should be added to the  33 - 5 million already sanctionedfor 1964, and this, together with an undertaking to announce the rest of the provision,has been the subject of a statement.5. The U.G.C. have completed their review, which has included discussionwith each university about its programme, and I have now received their advice.This falls into two parts:(1)  25 million should be added to the  33-5 million already sanctioned for1965 under the original programme. The U.G.C. rider to this is that&quot; if the Government feel unable, on financial or economic grounds, toprovide this amount, the Committee must advise that the objective willnot be attained &quot;.(2) For each of 1966 and 1967, for which no programmes have yet been sanctioned, starts of  35- 40 million should now be announced.Further details showing the way these proposals fit into earlier programmes, and theestimated effect on expenditure, are in Annex A of this note.6. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury has pointed out the substantial additional burden falling on the investment programme which these figuresrepresent and we have not up to now been able to reach agreement upon them.

announcement completing our provision for Robbins cannot possibly be delayedbeyond the Easter holidays, when our acceptance of the Robbins short-term programme will be seven months old.7. The whole three years covered by the U.G.C.&apos;s advice are linked together in relation to the Robbins objective, even though building starts in the latter twoyears will not, in any great measure, directly help towards the Robbins objective for1967-68. The importance of the latter two years is nevertheless great, since they arethe years in which some assurance can be given that after the sustained expansionthe universities will be allowed to make good some of the ground they have lost.From 1953 to 1957 we started only  27-8 million worth of new building. This is the under-capitalised base on which the expansion from 95,000 to 170,000 students inten years has to be sustained.8. One will not, of course, get planning economies if building starts so complexas those for universities are settled only one year ahead. Nor will one get orretrieve the goodwill of the universities themselves.9. The starts for 1966 and 1967 are important. Those for 1965 are vital. 1965is the last effective year to start building for the Robbins target. The U.G.C. havemade it quite clear that their proposal is a considered judgment. It is an illusionto suppose that the universities would achieve the Robbins target if the provisionwe make is announced as falling short of what the U.G.C. advise. I could not suppor tsuch a decision.10. The U.G.C. has twice compressed the proposals of the universities for1964 and 1965 first from  100 million to  60 million to conform with Robbins figuresof student^mee^bere, then from  60 million to  40 million. Officials have subjectedthese proposals to further scrutiny.11.  The results of this scrutiny can be summarised as follows:(a) The provision for student residence would raise the proportion provided with residence from 30 per cent of students now, to 37 per cent in1967-68.(b) So far as buildings other than residence are concerned, the additionproposed in the U.G.C. programme for 1964 and 1965 for an extra17,000 students is about  20 million, or about  1-200 per extra student.This compares with a historic cost in the early 1960s of  2,300 perstudent for academic buildings started as long ago as 1958.(c) Taking into account provision already made but not yet fruitful in termsof academic accomodation, and adding to it what the U.G.C. now propose for 1965, the cost of reaching the Robbins target by adding46,000 students to the present population by 1967-68 comes out at about  2,700 per student. This is less than the figure to be inferred fromthe Robbins Report.12. The pressure from crude student demand, which will slacken after1967-68, is by no means the only matter we have to consider. The development of management studies, the foundation of further new universities (to one of which,in Scotland, we are already committed) and the building up of major technologicalinstitutions, are matters which cannot be indefinitely deferred. They are not allowed for in the U.G.C.&apos;s proposals for 1965, and unless substantial provision isannounced now for 1966 and 1967 our intentions in these respects will not be credited.13. The effect of announcing a programme now, which would not only cover the Robbins expansion with the support of the U.G.C., but give an earnest ofour future intentions on university development cannot, in my view, beoverestimated. The uncertainties and doubts about our long-term intentions arethe real cause of the malaise in the university world.14. The alternative is to announce a programme of university development which is not backed by the U.G.C. I am sure the Cabinet cannot contemplate this.15. I seek my colleagues&apos; agreement to my making an announcement on thelines of the draft at Annex B.Office of the Lord President and Minister for Science,20th March, 1964.

On the 5th February I announced the supplementation of therecurrent grant for the rest of this Quinquennium which is required for theexpansion planned following the Robbins Report, and the additional buildinggrant for 1964, which brought building work to be started in universities this year from  33-5 million to  48-5 million.I said then that consultations on the additional capital starts for later years were still in progress, and would be announced in due course. The U.G.C. havenow advised me on the starts required in 1965, and have indicated the level ofstarts they would consider necessary in 1966 and 1967, without taking account of developments yet to be considered in connection with the 10-year programme.Following this advice the Government has decided that the starts for 1965 shouldbe increased from the  33-5 million already authorised, to  58-5 million; andthat the level of starts to be contemplated in 1966 and 1967 should not be lessthan  35 million in each of those years.I would emphasise that these sums are very large indeed, especially whentaken together with the substantial programme already in train. They mean thatin the four years 1962 to 1965 inclusive, building starts in the universities will havetotalled  162 million, involving expenditure of nearly  250 million when land, fees,and equipment are taken into account. The result of it will be to make our existinguniversities about 50 per cent larger in 1967-68 than they were in 1961-62.It is the advice of the U.G.C. that, together with the contribution from the present.A.Ts. and other institutions which are in process of attaining university status,these allocations to existing universities will enable the objective for 1967-68recommended in the Robbins Report to be attained. The U.G.C. are already working on the 10-year programme of university development, required for thenext stage of university expansion, but we can now be certain that, given the efforts and goodwill of all concerned, the first stage is provided for.
