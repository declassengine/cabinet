THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1964Copy No.   5 1CABINETPOST OFFICE SAVINGS BANK: REMOVAL FROM london memorandum by the Postmaster-GeneralFollowing the Government&apos;s general acceptance of the Flemming Report thedecision has been taken to move the Post Office Savings Bank to a location wellout of London. After interdepartmental discussion, I believe that only three areas,Glasgow, Liverpool and Tees-side, fit the general specifications. They all havehigh unemployment rates, are in need of clerical employment and can meet theBank&apos;s large need for local staff. To this extent the national interest would be served by sending the Bank to any one of the three.2. The Annex to this paper sets out succinctly some of the factors bearing on a decision. The view of the Bank Management is that Tees-side has the edgeover the others. The view of the junior London staffs, expressing their preferenceby voting at an earlier stage, was marginally for Tees-side over Liverpool, but their leadership has since come out strongly for Tees-side and the staff have accepted this lead. They have made it clear that they would co-operate in a move to Tees-side. The senior staff are opposed to a move and have, therefore, expressedno preference as to location.3. On the other hand, I think it fair to say that in recent times we havedone more for the North-East than for the North-West. I think the choice reallylies between Tees-side and Liverpool, but being a Liverpool Member I should welcome the views of my colleagues.J. R. B.General Post Office, E.C. 1,9th March, 1964.CP.
