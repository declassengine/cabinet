ffllS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJSSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)31CP.(64) 79 COPY NO,20th March, 1964CAEINETPOST OFFICE SAVINGS-BANKMemorandum by the Postmaster general at Cabinet on 17th March (CM. (64) 19th Conclusions, Minute 9)I was invited in consultation with the Chief Secretary to the treasury to ascertain the probable reaction of the staff of the Post Office savings bank if it were decided to move the Bank to Glasgow.2.       The senior staff, numbering 350, are represented by the society of Civil Servants,    Because they are opposed to the move they have sofar avoided expressing a view on the alternative locations, although Ihave told them that the Governments decision to move the Bank isirrevocable,   I have again seen representatives of the Society and theyhave refused to be drawn as to their preference,    I am, however,hopeful that they will say something to me before next Tuesday.    If theydo I will report orally.3.       The great body of clerical workers are represented by theC.S. C. A, with 5, 000 members.    I have again talked with them.    they said that up to perhaps one third of their members would be willing tomove to Tees-side, while only about five per cent would willingly goeither to Glasgow or to Liverpool.    I sounded them on their reaction ifit were decided to move to Glasgow.    They said they would regard sucha decision as an affront to the processes of consultation, that in their view it would give the impression that the Post Office were indifferent to the feelings of its staff, and that the degree of voluntary co-operation in support of such a move would be very small.4.       Both the Association and the Society clearly understand thatwhile the views of the staff must be taken into account in a matter ofthis kind, they cannot be decisive.    Nevertheless, and subject to what may be said by the Society ox Civil Servants during the next few days,there is no doubt about the strength of feeling for Tees-side.5.      It is difficult precisely to assess the likely results of adecision to override the Staffs clear choice for reasons which howevervalid are not connected with operational considerations.    It isdifficult to exaggerate the importance to the successful carrying through of a large dispersal operation of obtaining at least acquiescenceby the Staff.    I do not say that the dispersal of the Bank would prove impracticable in face of Staff Side hostility.    But I am sure that insuch circumstances it is likely that the programme of the move, whichis bound in any event to take some time, would be prolonged.    It isfor my colleagues to judge whether such overt resistance by the staff to transfer to a particular locality would be helpful in securing movesby private industry to the area in question.-1-secp;tv
SECHET6.       In accordance with the Cabinet Conclusion I have consulted the Chief Secretary,    He tells me that he is somewhat concerned at the possible effect of a row with the Staff in connection with this move on the dispersal operation as a whole.    I understand from him that while dispersal as such is naturally not agreeable to theStaff, on the whole relations with the various Staffs concerned inthe different moves have been good.    The Chief Secretary isconcerned lest this state of affairs, which has proved very helpful in making arrangements for dispersal, be disturbed by a disputearising from a decision in respect of the Post Office Savings Bank,The present dispersal operation, as my colleagues will recall,involves over 10, 000 staffs in addition to those involved in respectof the Post Office Savings Bank.J, R, B.General Post Office, E.C. 1.20th March, 1964-2-SECRE?
