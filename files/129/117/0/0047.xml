PUBLIC SERVICE INVESTMENT IN 1965/66 - housing memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentand Minister for Welsh AffairsThe paper circulated by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster General (CP, (64) 96) proposes a reduction of  13 million inthe new forecast of investment in housing in England and Wales in 1965-66.To this end, the Chief Secretary suggests that it is essential that approvalsfor local authorities and new towns in 1964 be kept down to 116, 000.2.      In a memorandum of 17th March, 1964, to the Economic PolicyCommittee (E, P. (64) 42), I explained why I thought it necessary to beable to approve 125, 000 houses this year, and I gave my views of thepolitical and other implications of limiting approvals to 116,000,    Forthe convenience of the Cabinet I am repeating the views then expressedin this paper.    Experience since March confirms that the difficulties I found in the proposed reduction were in no way over-stated, and before any decision is taken I should like my colleagues to be clear about theeffect of the Chief Secretary1^ proposal on the public housing programme.3,      As the Chief Secretary recognises, overt action would have to betaken immediately in order to keep open the possibility of limiting thetotal of 1964 approvals to 116, 000 - or indeed to 120, 000, as implied inthe previous 1965-66 investment programme.    Action would need to takethe form of a Government statement or a circular to local authorities.4.       I agree that this year&apos;s spurt in private enterprise building will,if maintained, enable us to reach our target of 400, 000 houses a year*with a smaller local authority contribution than was contemplated up to ashort while ago.    But I believe there is a minimum below which we ought not to cut the local authority programme;  and in order to meet what I regard as essential needs I should like to see not a cut in approvals thisyear but an increase to 125, 000.The needs catered for by local authorities5.       The main needs which should be met by local authority buildingare slum clearance, overcrowding, homelessness, old people and over-spill.    For the most part authorities have since 1961 been allowed tobuild only for those needs.    Priority has, however, been given tocertain groups of authorities in order to carry through our policies forrehabilitating the industrial Norm and especially for the vigorousattack on the worst slums, and to meet the pressing needs of Wales and*great  Bi-Itainls target:  rest of paper uses England and Wales figures.CP, (64) 97COPY NO.8th May, 1964CABINET-1-
Greater London,    Elsewhere I have restricted authorities in thenumber of houses they can build even for acknowledged needs.    Inrecent years restraints have been most severe in the Midlands andSouth-East, where pressure of population and other demands on thebuilding industry have been greatest? but there has also been somedamping down of demand, even in the North-West and Yorkshire, andin the South-West.    The result is that there are now pent-up demands to build for acknowledged needs in all parts of the country.6.      Public sector housing has expanded from 103,000 approvals in1961 to 108, 000 in 1962 and 120, 000 in 1963.    Almost the whole ofthis expansion was taken up by authorities in the priority areas.    Therest of the programme has been held steady, but with increasingdifficulty.    The Governments commitment in the White Paper on housing (Cmnd. 2050) and in later statements to a rising housing programme has led to an expectation that all authorities withacknowledged needs will have a share in the increase.7.       The pattern both of output and demand last year was distortedby the bad weather of the first quarter.    But by the last quarter localauthority submissions were running at an annual rate of well over120, 000 a year.   Many approvals had to be held over until the beginningof 1964, with the result that we started the year with the pipeline morethan usually full.8.      Most of the authorities in priority areas got near their targetslast year and will be expecting only modest increases in approvals in1964.    But authorities in the North-Sast have still to make theirspurt and I cannot hold them backj their need is great.    In order tomeet these priority requirements, while maintaining the programme for other needs at the 1963 level, I should need additional approvalsapproaching 10,000.    That is the measure of the reductions whichwould have to be made outside the priority areas if the 1964 approvalswere held at 120, 000.    Li March I estimated that this would representa cut of over 15 per cent for the non-priority areas j and that if theprogramme were reduced to 116, 000, the cut would be over 20 percent.    If I now had to bring approvals down to 116, 000 the cute would,with five months of the year gone, be even more severe, and mightbe as much as one-third of some local authority programmes.9.      Cuts of this magnitude would in my view lead to loss ofconfidence by both builders and local authorities.    The  cuts would fall most heavily on the Midlands and the South, but they would be felt in all parts of the country, except the North-East.10,      To allow the priority areas the programmes they urgentlywant, without reducing other areas below their 1963 level of approvals,I would need to approve 130, 000 this year,    I am asking however only for 125, 000.    I have taken steps to damp down demands outside the priority areas and I hope to keep within this figure:  if I can reduce itlower without a major row I will certainly do so.    But to hold approvalsto 120, 000, let alone to reduce them to 116, 000, could not be done without a series of major local rows.    Against complaints that wewere savaging plans for urgently needed houses for slum dwellers and old people, arguments directed to the general possibilities of overload,of which local symptoms would usually be undetectable, would cutlittle ice - especially with private house building forging ahead,-2-
Efficiency in the industry11 o     In the long-term the ability of the building industry to meetthe increasing demands on it, and our ability to achieve and sustainour Great Britain, programme of 400, 000 houses a year, depend verylargely on increased use of industrialised methods.    In housing, itis almost exclusively in the public sector that progress is being made.Not only do local authorities build most of the high flats, whichparticularly lend themselves to labour-saving methods, but all thepioneering work in the use of industrialised systems for 2-storeyhousing is being carried out in the public sector.    About 18 ^ per cent of all public house-building in 1964 will use these methods, comparedwith 12 per cent in 1963.    Severe restx*iction in public housing over alarge part of the country would be bound to cause a set-back, andweaken the confidence of builders who are developing new systems,for which they need assured and continuing orders.12.    One indispensable means of making faster progress in the useof modern methods is the better organisation of local authority demand.To this end I am now, with the co-operation of the local authority associations, in the middle of a campaign to get all the main house-building authorities throughout the country formed into groups to enablethem to assemble large and continuing programmes.    These efforts,too, will suffer a serious set-back if they have to be made against a background of restriction and reduced allocations.    Local authorities will see no future in combining to carry out smaller programmes.13.     Whatever may be the danger of overload on the construction industry generally later in the year, housebuilding performance inrecent months has remained good.    Under my proposals for a total programme of 125,000 approvals, the substantial increases in localauthority building over last yearTs level would take place in the North. -East where pressure on the construction industries is least likely todevelop.    In the Midlands and South there would be some reduction inthe public programme; but these areas will, of course, receive themain benefit of the increased private programme.    The increase inthe public housing programme over last year&apos;s would be more thanmatched by the additional dwellings built by industrialised methods.Conclusions14.     I accept that an increase in this year&apos;s local authority housing programmes is not essential in order to reach and improve on atotal programme for Great Britain of 350, 000 houses a year.    But I ask my colleagues to agree that I should have authority to give 125,000approvals in England and Wales this year on the grounds that anincreased local authority programme is necessary -(i) in order to avoid the embarrassment of substantial and widespread early cuts in allocations;(ii) to meet acknowledged housing needs in all parts of thecountry; and(iii) to help forward the modernisation of the house-building industry.K.
