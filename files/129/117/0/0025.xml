THIS: DOCUMENT IS THE:PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPOST. OFFICE SAVINGS BANKMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i think it may be worthwhile, following the discussions we have had at Cabinet,ifT set down for the consideration of my colleagues some thoughts on how we might present a decision to locate this project in Scotland to the staffs concerned and to the public. We seemed to have reached the position that these are theprincipal points outstanding.,2. On presentation to the staff, the following seem to me to be the main factors which would appeal to those involved in the transfer:(a) The availability of housing, both for rent and purchase, at costs very much16wer; than those which prevail in the London area. The LocalAuthorities, New Towns and Housing Associations around Glasgoware prepared to provide the widest range of rented accommodation evenin cases where the transferred staff have property to sell in the london area. Those who wish to buy will find a wide choice of both new andolder houses at distances from two miles upwards from the city centre at prices much lower than in London.(b) The ample facilities at all levels for the education of the children of the staffs involved and again the relatively modest cost at which this canbe provided. The reputation of Scottish education still stands high.There is the widest possible range both of non-fee paying schools and of direct grant schools where the scale of fees is much lower than in thesouth. At higher levels Glasgow has two universities: one of these willbe the most advanced technological university outside London. Thereare also special facilities in art, music and drama provided by the glasgow College of Art, and the Scottish Royal Academy of Musicand Dramatic Art. There are also ample facilities for commercialeducation and other specialist forms of training.(c) Outdoor amenities and facilities for the usual sports are of a high standard.The sea coast is readily accessible and there is a wide range of other facilities on offer including skiing, boating and even mountaineeringwithin a couple of hours of the city.(d) Cultural opportunities are also ample. The Scottish National Orchestrais based in Glasgow and within the next few years an entirely newconcert hall, theatre and cultural centre will be provided as ,an earlyphase in Glasgow&apos;s redevelopment. Within recent years Glasgow hasbeen able to mount operatic and other performances of the highestinternational standards. Theatrical performances in the city include&quot; West End&quot; productions: indeed many of the most spectacularsuccesses have been tried out there before being given their full Londonrun.(e) Finally, Glasgow has the reputation of being one of the most hospitablecities in the British Isles. This is one of the reasons, for example, whyso many executives of the very many American and Canadian firms which have settled in central Scotland since the war have decided tomake their homes in and around Glasgow.i.--.

3. As regards presentation to the public, there is of course no Scottish problem.We could fairly point out to Merseyside that the North-West already hadestablishments (other than local offices) providing employment for over 3,000 civilservants at Blackpool, Southport, Lytham St. Anne&apos;s and Liverpool itself. And toTees-side that the North-East had similar employment for over 8,000 at Newcastleand 2,000 at Durham. Our obligation to practise what we preach, and transfer to scotland some of the civil service employment that can be removed from theSouth-East, would surely be widely understood.4. Our final conclusion on this matter will be closely watched by all shades of public opinion. It will certainly not be overlooked that a previous administration in 1948 decided, despite the reluctance of the staff involved (including the higherdirecting staff), to transfer the Mechanical Engineering Research Laboratory of theD.S.I.R. from Teddington to East Kilbride. This move was an outstanding success not only for the area concerned but for the staff. There has been since then publicexpression of the satisfaction of the staff with their new location and the housing and other facilities made available to them: and there has been no difficulty in recruiting and holding the very specialised staff which this project required and agood deal of which is still drawn from the South.5. In the face of this precedent I find it difficult to believe that it is possiblefor us to allow it to become apparent that a final decision against Glasgow has beendictated by the preference of part of the Staff Side in the Post Office Savings Bank,especially as five-sixths of the staff are in the end to be recruited locally. My difficulty is increased because I cannot think of any other consideration disadvantageous to Glasgow that we could publicly put forward: the argument that Scotland shouldhave its share of the Governmenfs own dispersed office employment seems to meincontrovertible.M. A. C. N.Scottish Office, S.W.1,19th March, 1964.
