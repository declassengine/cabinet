IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CP. (64) 98 COPY NO.8th May, 1964CABINETCAPITAL FINANCjBOF THE UNIVERSITIESMemorandum by the Secretary of,State or the Home department the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with certain of mycolleagues, to examine the proposals for capital investmentsubmitted by the universities with a view to reducing &quot;the cost tothe minimum necessary to implement the Government^ under-taking that 170, 000 places would be provided in the universitiesin 1967-68 (CM. (64) 20th Conclusions, Minute 5, Conclusion (1)).2.      Immediately after the publication of the Robbins Reportlast October, the White Paper (Cmnd. 2165) was published inwhich we accepted the recommendations for the expansion of numbers in the universities down to 1967-68, and the calculationsof demand and available entrants on which they were basedjand we said that resources would be provided for the purpose andthat capital and recurrent grants would be adjusted accordingly.3.      Clearly it is the university buildings now under construc-tion and those started in 1964 and 1965 and (in the case of buildingsthat can be put up quickly) in the early part of 1966, which are relevant to the universities&apos; capacity to provide the 170, 000places in 1967-68.4.      Following publication of the Robbins Report, the 1964pi-ogramme of building starts was raised in January, 1964 from 33.5 million to  48.5 million, by agreement between theLord President and the Chief Secretary.5,       The University Grants Committee have proposed that the1965 programme of building starts should be raised from the pre-Robbins figure of  33.5 million to  58.5 million.   In doing so they have said that &quot;if the Government feel unable, on financial or economic grounds, to provide this amount, the committee must advise that the objective will not be attained. &quot;6.      After discussions extending over three meetings, my committee, comprising the Secretary of State for Education and science, the Chief Secretary, the Minister of State for Education-1-CO N FIDE NT! AL
and Science (Sir Edward Boyle), the Minister of Public building and Works and myself, agree to put forward to the CabinetS-(a) that, in the light of the proposals of the university grants Committee and the general economic prospectand the probable capacity of the construction industriesover the material time, the Government should decide on a building programme to implement the K.obbinsrecommendations for expansion of numbers in the universities down to 1967-68, phased as follows:Value of building to be started  million1965 48.5   ) 54First quarter, 1966 6B 0   )      0(b) that this should be the whole of the university building programme for the period up to March 1966j  and that from April 1966 onward the programme should be related(this is generally acceptable) to financial instead ofcalendar years;(c) that, in order to ensure that full value for money is obtained by the universities from the programme, the organisationof the University Grants Committee should be strengthened,and they should be urged to apply fully, with the help ofthe National Building Agency, techniques which put theleast strain on the construction industries.7.      Although they join in making this recommendation, theSecretary of State for Education and Science and the chief secretary regard themselves as not finally committed since the postion may be affected by the cabinet&apos;s consideration of wider aspects of civil public investment.   The Education ministers would have wished to see a larger programme than that indicatedin (a) above, but are prepared to acquiesce in it provided thereis no question of reducing it further: and they think the university grants Committee may be willing now to agree that it will auMice t;enable them, with difficulty, to reach the 170, 000 target.   TheChief Secretary maintains his contention that a lower figure would enable them to reach the target, but is prepared to acquiesce in it provided there is no question of yielding toUniversity Grants Committee pressure to increase it.    Therecommendation is therefore an agreed compromise, which i hope the Cabinet may be willing to accept.X&quot;jl * IB) aHome Office, S.W.18th May, 1964-2-
