2.       By the recent Fisheries Convention a number of european countries have agreed not to fish in a limited belt of the high seas out-side each other!s territorial waters.    The Convention could be ratifiedif a Bill were enacted whose effect was confined to the countries whichare parties to the Convention and their rights in the agreed belt.    once that legislation was passed, we should be free to alter our baselines.3.       In its present form the Fishery Limits Bill goes far beyond a mere implementation of the Convention,    It extends our exclusivefishery limits to twelve miles (which goes beyond the area specified bythe Convention) and provides unilaterally for the right to enforce theselimits not only against the parties to that Convention but against the whole world.4.       I agree with the Lord Chancellor that the mere enactment of theBill in its present form would not be a breach of international law.    Butif the point were taken in either House of Parliament, we should be boundto disclose that in international law its enforcement could be justified onlyon the basis that it involved an extension of the territorial sea of theUnited Kingdom.5.      A Bill on the lines indicated in paragraph 6 of the Lord Chancellor!smemorandum would present no difficulties in international law and could,in my opinion, be put in a workable form,J. G. S. H.Law Officers&apos; Department, W. C.2.6th May, 196452&quot;&quot;CP. (64) 95 COPY NO.6th May, 1964CABINETUNITED KINGDOM FISHERY LIMITSMemorandum by the Attorney general  feel bound to warn my colleagues that the Fishery Limits Bill inits present form could be justified in international law only on the basis that we were thereby extending our territorial sea to twelve miles.   Thiswas the effect of a formal Opinion which the Lord Chancellor whenAttorney General and I gave to the Foreign Secretary on 29th June, 1962.In my opinion, nothing has occurred since then to affect the position.
