Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1964CP. (64) 68 Copy No.    g j10th March, 1964 &apos; &apos;cabinet trade UNIONS AND THE LAWMemorandum by the Minister of labour at our meeting last Thursday (CM. (64), 17th Conclusions, Minute 2,(Conclusion (1)), the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with other ministers concerned, to prepare a further draft statement about trade union law and practice on the lines which had emerged from the discussion. After consultation with theLord Chancellor, the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, I now attach, at Annex A, a revisedstatement dealing with trade union law.It was the general view of Ministers present at the drafting meeting that astatement in this form would cover what was necessary. As the Cabinet indicated a wish for some possible wording on trade union practice to be prepared also, thishas been provided in a short separate note (Annex B), which could be added as anadditional paragraph, if desired.J. G.Ministry of Labour, S.W. 1,9th March, 1964.4070THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
Annex ADRAFT STATEMENT ON TRADE UNIONS AND THE LAWThe statute law relating to trade unions and employers associations is the sameas it was nearly 60 years ago. During this time the trade union movement has developed beyond recognition and now takes its place among the great social andeconomic organisations of the realm.The social and economic climate has completely altered. Full employment and improved social services have transformed society, while new industrial methods and the approach of automation throw out fresh challenges for the future.Recent decisions in the Courts have focused attention on the present state ofthe law. The Government are of the opinion that the time has come when it should again be reviewed. Such a review is likely to be most effective if undertaken withthe willing co-operation of both employers associations and trade unions and free from the atmosphere of political controversy.The Government propose to seek such co-operation and think it advisable thatsuch an inquiry should be undertaken early in the life of the next Parliament. Atthe appropriate time they will discuss with the Trades Union Congress and theBritish Employers&apos; Confederation and others concerned the soope of the inquiry and the methods by which it can best be conducted.
Annex possible ADDITIONAL PARAGRAPH ON TRADE UNION PRACTICEThere are other problems facing employers and trade unions as a result ofthe changes to which I have referred. Full employment and improved social servicesdepend on increasing productivity by more efficient use of labour and capital equipment. These are not matters which can be dealt with by law. The primary responsibility rests with managements and the trade unions. These problems andthe underlying causes, among which fear of insecurity and resistance to changerank high, have been discussed by the Government, management and trade unions on the National Economic Development Council. The Government will initiatefurther discussions with industry in order to ensure the most effective use of ourmanpower resources.
