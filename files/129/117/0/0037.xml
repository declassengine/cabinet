CABINETMAJOR DEFENCE WORKS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IN 1965-66Memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster general cannot agree that decisions on this matter should be deferred in the waysuggested by the Secretary of State for Defence and the Minister of public building and Works in their memorandum (CP. (64) 84).2. I am not seeking an &quot; arbitrary reduction &quot; in major Defence works in theUnited Kingdom. Our present assessment is that if programmes of Civil and defence construction increase by more than about 5 per cent between 1964-65and 1965-66, the construction industry will be overloaded, and the proposals Ihave made on the Civil side reflect this.3. The report by officials of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry ofPublic Building and Works suggests that expenditure on major Defence works inthe United Kingdom will rise from  44-8 million in 1964-65 to  51-56 million in1965-66, an increase of 15 per cent. But these figures, as the officials point out,exclude all expenditure on married quarters. This expenditure will, under thearrangements recently agreed, amount to  13 million in 1964-65 and  16 million in 1965-66. This compares with  10 million under this head in the year 1963-64and is oddly enough described as a &quot; cut &quot; in paragraph 3 of the Secretary of State&apos;sand Ministers memorandum. The total load on the construction industry in1964-65 and 1965-66 on Defence Account thus becomes  57-8 million and 67-56 million, an increase of 17 per cent.4. We have reached agreement very recently, with some difficulty, on the size of the married quarters building programme, and I do not propose to ask now that this question should be reopened or that cuts in other works must be madeto accommodate the large increase in the married quarters building programme.5. I am not, however, prepared to agree that any other type of major defence work should be excluded from our present review. Work which arises out ofour obligations to NATO or the United States Air Force, or out of our decisions about Polaris, represent as much of a loan on the construction industry as anyother Defence works of comparable size. The priority to be given to them as againstother defence works is a matter for the Secretary of State for Defence. these services must, therefore, be brought fully into our calculations. To reach a target of a 5 per cent increase over 1964-65 on all major works excluding married quarters,it will be necessary to hold expenditure in 1965-66 to  47-04 million-that is tosay, a reduction in what is proposed of about  4-^ million, not  2 million as suggestedby the Secretary of State for Defence and the Minister of Public Building and works.6. I do not doubt that it will be difficult to achieve a reduction of this order.To do so it will be necessary to act very quickly to curtail new starts in 1964-65.Delay until after the Defence Review Costings are available would, in practice, makeit impossible to achieve the necessary reductions in 1965-66.4202Printed jor the Cabinet. April 1964   ?CP. (64) 87 Copy No. 5 213th April, 1964
7. I know that reductions of this order in their works programmes will beunpalatable to the Services. But we have, on the basis that the Secretary of Statefor Defence gives priority to them, recently agreed to a substantial increase in the married quarters building programme, which will stand. I hope that this, and thefact that, even as reduced under my proposals, Defence works services will stillincrease between 1964-65 and 1965-66 to about the same extent as Civilconstruction (or perhaps more, if the married quarters programme is included) willbe appreciated.conclusion. I ask my colleagues to agree that the increase in expenditure on majorDefence works in the United Kingdom, excluding married quarters, between1964-65 and 1965-66 should be restricted to 5 per cent.J.
