-  STATIONING COSTS IN germany memorandum by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and paymaster General. Difficult decisions are now required on the handling of the negotiations withthe Federal German Government about new arrangements to offset the balance ofpayments cost of our forces in Germany.2. After the ending of the occupation period in 1955, the Germansprogressively reduced and finally discontinued their direct contribution to the costof our forces in West Germany (apart from West Berlin, where the Allied troopsstill have the status Of forces of occupation). However, the Brussels Treaty providedthat, if the maintenance of the United Kingdom forces on the mainland of Europethrew at any time too great a strain on our external finances, we could invite NATOto review the financial conditions on which our formations are maintained.3. Accordingly, following our balance of payments crisis of July 1961, weinvoked the lengthy NATO procedure in order to obtain a &quot; certificate of need &quot;.Oh this basis, and after a subsequent prolonged bilateral negotiation with theGermans, my predecessor as Chief Secretary to the Treasury reached anagreement with them known as the Agreed Minute of 6th June, 1962 (Cmnd. 1766).This provided that in each of the two financial years 1962-63 and 1963-64 theGerman Government would secure relief to our balance of payments to the extentof DM.600 million ( 53^ million) a year by placing defence contracts in thiscountry, by civil purchases and by taking over United Kingdom overseas aidcommitments. In the first of those two years there was a substantial shortfall inGerman payments under the agreement but over the past year, after a series of negotiations which I have had with Dr. Dahlgruen, the German Minister ofFinance, the Agreed Minute has been implemented. This has been achieved bypayments of DM.970 million ( 87 million) under defence contracts and payments of DM.230 million ( 20 million) in the civil field. These figures were, however,only attained by advance payments of roughly DM.330 million (roughly 30 million), which to that extent reduces the scope for future payments. Theactual benefit which we have enjoyed as a result of the agreement is a good dealless than these figures might suggest, as we should have received part of thisbusiness in any case; for instance, a fair proportion of the payments flow fromcontracts already signed or under negotiation before the Agreed Minute was settled.4. At the time of my predecessor^ negotiation the balance of payments costof our troops in Germany was running at about  70 million a year. For the coming year it is estimated at about  85 million. This is a serious factor in our balance ofpayments problems, and we have therefore been pressing the Germans for a new agreement for a period from 1st April, 1964. Dr. Dahlgruen has invited me toBonn to negotiate about this, and the dates of 20th-21st May have been set aside for this purpose, but not yet announced. (The dates are, however, liable to be made public in Bonn at any time.)5. By way of contrast the Germans arrived in September 1962 at an Agreementwith the United States under which they undertook to offset completely theForeign Exchange costs of the United States forces in Germany (currently running at approximately $650 million) by means of purchase of United States arms.4304Printed for the Cabinet.

..6., It has become increasingly clear for some ,time that the Germans arereluctant to make a satisfactory offer as to the future; Dr. Ernafd, when he was iriLondon in January, spoke of DM.250 million (about  22 million) a year as the prospective figure for defence payments. We have now received a German workingpaper, designed as a basis for the proposed negotiations, which reiterates this figure though apparently having defence contracts rather than defence payments in mind^and proposes no specific level of contracts or payments in the Civil field.Thus, it envisages a two-year agreement on the following basis:     ...(a) Defence contracts. DM.500 million ( 444 million) over the two-year period.(b) Civil and off-shore purchases. A &quot; best endeavours &quot; assurance, with no commitment on figures.7. As in the past two years a substantial proportion of any business whichmight nominally be attributed to such an agreement would have come to usin any case. It is clear that unless the Germans are prepared to improve very substantially on this offer, the benefit involved for us would be incommensuratewith our problem, and it would be politically indefensible to conclude an agreement on this basis.8. The first question therefore for decision is whether I should confirm thearrangements for my visit to Bonn, or whether I should let Dr. Dahlgruen know that there is no point in the visit unless he is in a position to make in advance amuch improved proposal. On balance, I am inclined to feel that I should proceedwith the visit while recognising that it may not be possible to reach agreement. Iwould in this event propose to send in advance a personal message to Dr. Dahlgruen,expressing disappointment at the contents of the working paper, and telling himplainly that agreement on anything like these terms is out of the question. Thealternative, attractive in some ways, of not going would, I am afraid, produce nobetter proposals from the Germans, and a month has already elapsed since the&apos;old Agreement ran out. And it may transpire that the German figure is only an opening bargaining position.9. The second question is what level of payments we should regard as theminimum acceptable for a future agreement. The Germans are adamantly opposedto any direct budgetary contribution, and there are limitations on what can beachieved by the present methods of Government or public authorities procurement.It is therefore certain that, in spite of the increased cost which we are bearing, wewould if we made an agreement have to settle for lower figures than my predecessornegotiated. I am inclined to think that I should be authorised to proceed with aview to an agreement providing for military, civil and off-shore purchases at aminimum of DM.450 million &apos;( 40 million) a year for the next two years.10. If a satisfactory agreement could not be negotiated, we should have toconsider whether to refer the problem to NATO, and whether to reduce thebalance of payments costs involved in our NATO commitment by reducing thenumbers in BAOR. I feel that this is something which in any case we will have tobear in mind, since at best we are not going to recover from the Germans morethan a part of this balance of payments expenditure.11. I would be grateful for the advice of my colleagues on these points, whichhave of course a bearing on Anglo-German relations generally. These seem likely in any event to be of some delicacy in the light of Foreign Office telegram No. 604to Tokyo and subsequent telegrams about the possibility of a visit to germany by President Nasser.J.A.B.-C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,5th May, 1964.
