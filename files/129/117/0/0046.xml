HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)E.P.(64) 627th May, 1964 COPY NO.        jjjjjCABINETECONOMIC POLICY COMMITTEE.PUBLIC SERVICE INVESTMENT IN 1965-66Memorandum by the Chief Secretary tothe Treasury and Paymaster-general at their meeting on 22nd January, 1964, the Economic PolicyCommittee considered E.P.(64) 13.    That paper suggested that public service investment, which, between 1964-65 and 1965-66,was (at constant prices) forecast to rise by  95 million (from 1,275 million to  1,370 million), should be allowed to rise by only  55 million (to  1,330 million).   The Committee, after discussion, invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for officials to review the forecast public service investment programme for 1965-66 and to report on ways in which the increase over 1964-65 might be limited to  55 million (E.P.(64) 3rd meeting,Item 2).2.     The result of the examination by officials was contained inthe report circulated under cover of E.P.(64) 39? on the basisof which I made the recommendations contained in E.P.(64) 41 *The report by officials showed how investment in 1965-66 couldbe limited by the creation of a reserve of investment projectstotalling just under  30 million (not the full  40 millionimplied in the Committee&apos;s earlier decision).

5*     Since our original discussions earlier this year, the pressure of demand on the economy has grown, and somerestraining action has already had to be taken in the Budget.In the ordinary course of events the investment programme for1965-66 would not &quot;be settled until July.     But I am convincedthat in the light of the prospective state of the economy andof these new investment figures, another two months&apos; delay would simply endanger the position further.     The time has now come when we should decide firmly that Departmental investment programmes as now submitted should be scaled down,6.     Although the Chancellor&apos;s and my primary concern is with thetotal demands on the economy, public service investment doesplace a particularly heavy burden on the construction industries.Here too, the prospect is no better than was foreseen in January.Unless, therefore, we make planned adjustments to our programmesnow, however unpalatable these may be individually, ordinaryeconomic forces will produce an unplanned shortfall in performance.7.      In the light of this position I am clear that firm decisions on the level of investment in 1965-66 must be taken now.    In my view the only satisfactory solution would be to cut plannedinvestment from the  1,535 million now forecast to  1,440 million(i.e. the level, translated into 1964 prices, at which it wouldhave stood had the recommendations in E.P.(64) 41 been accepted).I set out below how far I think this can be done.HOUSING- - ENGLAND AND WALES8.      The figure of  340 million (at 1963 prices) which was discussed by the Committee earlier this year related toapprovals in 1964 of 120,000 new houses for local authoritiesand new town corporations.    The proposals in E.P.(64) 41, toreduce this figure by  10 million, related to approvals in1964 of 116,000.    The present proposed expenditure of 435 million (at 1964 prices) relates to approvals in 1964 of125,000 new houses for local authorities and new towncorporations.    It also includes  23 million for BuildingAssociations which, under the new Act, will be partly financed by the Exchequer.    I suggest that it is essential that approvalsfor local authorities this year be kept down to the 116,000level.    Even this, because of the time lag between approvalsand expenditure, will only save about  13l? million of actual expenditure in 1965-66.    I realise that this cannot be donewithoLit it becoming public knowledge, since it me?.ns that theMinister of Housing will have to operate his existing machineryof control over local authority housing applications by restricting the numbers approved;    but this is preferable to allowing the housing programme to develop so as to createdangerous pressures within the economy as a whole.9.      I should add that approvals of even 116,000 houses will mean a considerably larger claim on real resources than wepreviously thought it would.   This is partly because, as it now appears, the cost of building standard houses was muchunderestimated in the Minister of Housing1s earliercalculations;    and partly because his new programme containsmore high flats and other kinds of dwelling which aredisproportionately expensive.2.
Housing - Scotland10.    The figure of  72 million previously before the Committeehas now been increased to  96 million.    Of this increase alittle over  6 million is attributable to price and standardincreases and the remaining  18 million represents more houses.It was not proposed earlier this year to cut back the investment in Scottish housing then intended, but I think it would now be only right to reduce the new figure of  96 million to  78 million which would be the cost at 1964 prices of the level of housingpreviously envisaged.    I fully appreciate that this will requirethe introduction in Scotland of a control over local authority housing starts which has not previously existed;    but neverthe-less I must ask my colleagues to agree that it is time to calla halt to this uncontrolled expansion of demand.11.    I should perhaps make it clear that, if my proposals on housing, on both sides of the Border, are fully accepted, theGovernment&apos;s declared policy of achieving an annual rate of400,000 houses a year by the late sixties would in no way bej eopardised.Universities12.    I have already accepted an increase of building starts for1964 of  15 million (i.e. additional capital expenditure ofabout  22-!- million), involving increased investment of  8.5 million in 1965-66.    The need for an increase in building starts of 25 million for 1965? (i.e. additional capital expenditure ofabout  37-g- million) on top of the  33^ million already approved for that year, is under consideration by a group of ministers under the chairmanship of the Home Secretary:    the proposal if accepted in full would involve additional investment in 1965-66of  9.5 million.The Remainder13.    The report by officials (E.?.(64) 39) demonstrated how afurther  19-20 million could be saved on programmes other thanhousing and universities and in my view we should decide now tomake these reductions.   In some cases the new figures now available show increases in real terms over and above thefigures on which the saving of  19-20 million was based. . Inthese cases, in order to get back to the level intended earlier,it will be necessary to reduce the new figure by that much more.The following are the changes which would be needed to thefigures as now forecast (at 1964 prices) if this principle is applied:3.

SUMMARY14.    In short, I propose &quot;that we should decide now that thefollowing reductions should he made in expenditure on publicservice investment in 1965-66 as at present forecast:Housing - England and V/aless     13 millionHousing - Scotland t     18 millionOther investment(excluding Universities)    s (say)  27 millionWe should also have to consider how whatever is decided inrespect of the universities can be fitted in.J.A.B.-C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.17th May, 1964
annex public    SERVICE    INVESTMENT.  1965-66Report by officials.     Departments have now submitted for the current InvestmentReview their forecasts of public service investment for eachyear up to and including 1968-69.     For 1965-66&apos;the forecastsshow substantial increases in expenditure compared with thetotal agreed last year.      The total to which Departments were working was . 1,370 million at 1963 prices;    the forecast totalis now  1,535 million at 196q. prices.     Price increases( 87 million) account for more than half the increased expenditure now forecast;    the remainder of the increase( 78 million) represents a real increase in demand on resources.The changes forecast for individual Departments are dealt with separately below.     Appendix I compares the expenditure approvedfollowing the 1963 Review (with certain later amendments) withthat now forecast.     Appendix II summarises the earlier proposals for a reserve of public service investment projects for 1965-66 currently under consideration by Ministers.Ministry of Housing and Local Government2*     Housing.     The forecast for 1965-66 shows an increase of 90 million over the previous estimate.     Of this  23 millionrepresents building for letting at cost rents by housing associations under section 7 of the Hoi;sing Act 1961 and thecurrent Housing Bill, which was not included in last year&apos;estimate.3.     Of the remainder  1+6 million is accounted for by increases in the average cost per dwelling.      This is mainly but not whollydue to price increases;    about  15 million of it is the resultof local authorities building a higher proportion of the more expensive types of dwelling (e.g. multi-storey flats) than hadbeen expected.      Something is due to an increase in the size and quality of dwellings.     Another  7 million is accounted forby the increased allowance for land.h.      The estimated numbers of starts and completions in 1965-66were formerly estimated at 127,250 and 122,250 respectively.The revised forecast figures, which assume approvals in 196h of125,000, are now 128,000 and 130,000.     The increase accounts for approximately  13 million.5.      Of the increase of  90 million,  39 million is attributable to price increases (including land);     23 million is ettributableto the inclusion of housing associations;    and  28 million is attributable to extra building, more expensive types of building and higher standards.6-,     Wat er and Sewer age.     There is a small decrease of about 1 million in real terms under this head,7*     QthgJl*     There is an increase of  2^-3 million in real terms under this head.Ministry of Transport8*     goad Progr amguj.     This shows an increase of approximately 1 million compared with last year&apos;s total.     None of this is attributable to price increases.1.
9*     Other.      This shows an increase of over  3 million, or? which 0.1 million is attributable to price increases, and  3.2 million is real.     But some of this expenditure is in effectuncontrolled.Department of Education and Science10.    Universities.      The forecast of expenditure on universitieshas increased by  19.7 million.      Of this, an increase of 8.5 million has already been authorised and a further increaseof  9.5 million is currently under consideration.     The balanceof  1.7 million is attributable to a change in the method of calculation used &quot;between last year&apos;s Review and this year1 sReview.     None of the increase is attributable to price changes.11.   0ther. Educ at ion..     The increase of  11.6 million is attributable as to  6.1+ million to an increase in cost limitsagreed last November and as to  5.2 million to an increasedprogramme, already announced.Ministry of Health12.    Hospitals.     No increase in work to be undertaken is proposed.The whole of the increase of  1.5 million is attributable to price increases.13.    Local Health and Welfare.     The increase of  0.8 million isalso wholly attributable to price increases.Home OfficeIII. Of the total increase of  3 million, approximately half is attributable to price increases and half represents an increasein real demand on resources - but see next paragraph.Ministry of Public Building and Works15.    There is a decrease of  2.3 million, made up of price increases of  0.8 million and a real decrease of  3-1 million.      Of thisdecrease, however,  1.5 million relates to prison building,responsibility for which has only just been taken over from theHome Office.      It can therefore be regarded as offsetting the 1,5 million real increase in Home Office investment referredto above,MJLnistry of Agriculture, ffisherJLej^jand Food16,    There is a decrease of  0.9 million, which more than achievesthe reduction envisaged earlier.Ministry of Aviation17.    There is an increase of  1.3 million under this head, ofwhich  0.5 million is attributable to price increases.     Thebalance includes an element for the re-allocation of the costs of a joint project between the Ministry and the Ministry ofDefence.Board of Trade18.    There is a djecrjsasje of  1.2 million, made up of price increases of  0.2 million and a real decrease of  1.1+ million.2,

It has not beenpossible to identify any element attributable to price increases,Bjcojt t:i sh. Pep ar tm ent s20 *   Hoju^sins.      The programme for development and growth in central&quot; Scotland, togethei-1 with the movement towards the Governmentstarget of 1+0,000 houses per annum in Scotland as a whole has led toan increase of 6,000 in the average number of public housing startsand completions for 1965-66 over the estimate made last year.The average cost per house lias also risen over the year becauseof the rise in prices and the increasing amount of multi-storeybuilding.     At 196h prices last year&apos;s programme would,  therefore,have cost  78.2 million.      The addition to the programme now envisaged accounts for the further  18 million.21.    gjducatIon.      There is an increase of about  1 million underthis head which is wholly attributable to price increases.22.   Road Programme.      There is an increase of  0.2 million underthis head&quot; made up of price increases of  0.6 million, and a realdecrease of  0.1+ million.23.    li^er^J^&amp;^Sjwera e.

There is an increase of  0.5 million of which 0.3 million is attributable to price increases and  0.2 million is real.25.    Otherr*     There is an increase of  3.7 million under this head.This sector covers a great many individually small services.It is assumed that of the  3.7 million about  1.7 million is attributable to price increases, and roughly  2 million to anincrease in real terms.
