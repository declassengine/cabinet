his document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)51CP. (64) 62 COPY NO.   -4th March., 1964CABINETTRADE UNION LAW AND PRACTICEMemorandum by the Minister of labour at a meeting of Ministers on Tuesday, 18th February (GEN. 843/1st Meeting), I was invited to consult trade union opinion further and toreport to the Prime Minister.    This I have now done and the PrimeMinister asked me to submit a short note together with a possible state-ment as a basis for consideration by my colleagues.2.      It is quite clear that the motion on the Order Paper now signed by more than 120 members, together with the recent spate of press comment, has made it impossible for me to secure the co-operation ofthe T. U. C. in any measures directed tov/ards the setting up of a RoyalCommission at the present time.3.      The view taken when this was last discussed was that it would be unwise to appoint a Royal Commission without the co-operation of thetrade unions.    As that co-operation is not now likely to be forthcomingprior to an Election, the alternatives would seem to be:-(a)    to make no announcement in advance of an Election and seek to stave off pressure in the House and in the country on thismatter;(b) to give an undertaking in the Manifesto that if re-elected we propose to take early steps to set up a Royal Commission oran inquiry;(c) to announce now that we have decided, if returned, to set upa Royal Commission immediately after the Election, butto make clear that we were taking no action at this time,nor were we asking either the trade unions or others to commit themselves as to their attitude to the setting up ofsuch a body until the time arose.4.      As regards the first alternative, it should be possible, though itwould be very difficult in the House, to hold the present position.    Thiswill be made more difficult, however, by the publication of the white paper on Monopolies and Restrictive Practices this week.5.      On the second alternative, provided we could indicate to members the way in which the Governments mind was moving on this matter, thisshould go a long way to improve the feeling in the House and an announce-ment in the Manifesto would provide material for use in the constituenciesat the time when it would be most wanted by those who claim it as anelectoral asset.-1-
6i      As regards the third alternative, this Has initial attractions butruns the risk of an attack building up between now and the Election, andalso of the charge that the announcement is being made not in the interestsof industry but as a sop to Conservative M.P.s. who are irritated aboutResale Price Maintenance.    A possible statement if it were decided tofollow this course is attached as an annex to this paper.7.      No final view is yet available from the Law Officers on theeffects of the judgment in this case although it is expected within thenext few days.    The T. U. C. for their part have not yet secured an opinion on it either.    Any announcement at this stage would certainly be greeted with surprise by the trade unions.    Whatever they said aboutthe merits of the case, they would certainly claim that it had been rushedand that there had been inadequate consultation.    The British EmployersConfederation would, also expect to be consulted before any announcementso important as this in this field.8.      There are, of course, many political implications.    These canbe discussed.J. G.Ministry of Labour, S. W. 1.4th March, 1964-2-CONFIBENT1/4&amp;,
DRAFT statement the Government have been carefully studying the recentjudgment of the House of Lords in the case of Rookes v. Barnard,While there may be room for differences of view about its full implications, it is clear that the judgment establishes that the immunity from legal action conferred by the Trade Disputes Act,1906, on those who act in furtherance of trade disputes is lessextensive than had been widely believed.    It does not necessarily follow that it would be right to amend the law on that account, but itis for consideration whether the provisions of an Act passed nearly 60years ago and of other trade union legislation, some of which goesback nearly 100 years, are still appropriate to modern needs andconditions.   Complex questions arise, which could be resolved only by a most detailed and authoritative study, and the Government have concluded that it would be right to appoint a Royal Commission to investigate and report on the whole question of the law relating totrade unions and trade disputes.    The enquiry should cover employers associations many of which are legally trade unions, as well asworkers&apos; trade unions.    The Government think however that it wouldbe preferable not to set up a Royal Commission at this stage in the life of the present Parliament.   They propose therefore to defer itsappointment until a new Parliament has been elected.    At theappropriate time, they will wish to discuss with the Trades UnionCongress, the British Employers&apos; Confederation and others concerned the composition and terms of reference of the Royal Commission andtrust that they will be able to count on general support.   The Govern-ment do not ask for any definite response at this stage, but bearing inmind the doubts raised by the judgment referred to they felt it rightto make clear the decision which they have reached,-3-ANNEX
