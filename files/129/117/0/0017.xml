THIS DOCUMENT IS..THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTROYAL COMMISSION ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentOver long years the development of penal policy and of the methods and institutions by which effect is given to it has, as a whole, been unco-ordinated andfragmentary. In relation to young offenders particularly, diverse administrative arrangements have grown up which may well not be wholly appropriate to modern conditions. I am sure that the time has come for a review.2. Penal philosophy and practice were last comprehensively examined bythe Gladstone Committee on Prisons which reported in 1895. The White Paper onPenal Practice in a Changing Society (Cmnd. 645), which my predecessorpublished just five years ago, foreshadowed a fundamental re-examination of penalpolicy on the basis of the knowledge to be gained from research about the causes of crime and the effectiveness of present methods of treatment. Although somerelevant long-term research projects are not yet complete, I am convinced that we ought not to defer an enquiry further, in view of the increase in crime and thewiedspread view that existing methods of dealing with offenders are not necessarilyright.3. The Home Affairs Committee agreed at their meeting on 14th February(H.P. (64) 5th Meeting, Minute 2) with my conclusion that a review of the scope and magnitude which is called for justified the appointment of a RoyalCommission with wide terms of reference which should be invited to approach itstask in two stages. The first would be to review the treatment of offenders up tothe age of 21, since the study of this age group is likely to offer the best prospectof working out measures which would reduce the scale of the problem of adultoffenders, and would also suitably complement the study of the prevention ofdelinquency among young people now being undertaken through the AdvisoryCommittee on Juvenile Delinquency which the Secretary of State for Scotlandand I recently appointed.4. The second stage of the Commission^ task, which might well not bereached for some two or three years, by which time further research results shouldhave become available, would consist of an enquiry into the treatment of adultoffenders. It is of course essential that the Royal Commission^ enquiry should not prevent us from making meanwhile such improvements in existing methods and institutions as are necessary to meet our current needs.5. The Royal Commission^ enquiry would not extend to Scotland, where a departmental committee under the chairmanship of Lord Kilbrandon has justcompleted an enquiry into the treatment of children and young persons. It wouldbe inappropriate to duplicate that. The Secretary of State for Scotland and Icontemplate, however, that the Commission should include a Scottish member.6. I am in no doubt that the announcement of a Royal Commission withbold terms of reference would meet with wide public approval, and, with the PrimeMinisters agreement, I seek my colleagues&apos; approval of this course. I append draftterms of reference (Annex A) which indicate the range of the enquiry I have inmind, and take account of points raised in discussion in the Home AffairsCommittee.Primed for the Cabinet.

The Home Affairs Committee considered that it would be desirable to publish, simultaneously with the Prime Minister^ announcement of theappointment of a Royal Commission, a short White Paper explaining the background of the enquiry and the need for a comprehensive review of penal policyand practice.

Q &apos;     X 0 STHE WAR AGAINST CRIME IN ENGLAND AND &quot;WALES1959 - 196k
Introduction.1 .     It is time to take stock of developments over the past fiveyears in crime, the prevention and detection of crime, and thetreatnent   of offenders^ and to look again into the future.2.     Early in 1959 the Government published a White Paper entitled&quot;Penal Practice in a Changing Society11&apos; (Cmnd. 61+5).     It was thefirst general analysis and review of the post-war situation.

In 1959 it was, by common consent, too early to put thatfundamental re-examination in hand.

In 1959 it was, by common consent, too early to put thatfundamental re-examination in hand.     Results of important researchstudies could not for some years be expected to become available,and the post-war constructional programme in the penal field wasbut newly under way.Five eventful years have passed since then.II - The increase^ in pr.1 me5.     At the time of the 1959 White Paper, crime had been increasing for over three years;    the improvement between 1951and 1955 had proved short-lived.     The increase has continued;so too has the tireless search for still more effective ways ofgrappling with it.
6.     The total number of indictable offences recorded by the policerose between 1958 and 1962 by k3 per cent.     The number of offences of breaking and entering rose by 1+7 per cent, and the number of offences of violence against the person by L8 per cent.Convictions of indictable offences increased between 1958 and 1962by 39 per cent.     One-third of all those found guilty of indictableoffences each year are under the age of 17? and one-half are under21.     Twc-thirds of those found guilty of breaking and enteringoffences are under 21 .7.     Some part of the increase in the number of known crimes isprobably due to the strengthening of police forces, readierreporting by the public, and better recording by the police.     but even so the actual volume of crime has increased substantially.The criminal statistics as hitherto compiled do not enable it tobe measured and analysed as accurately as could be wished;   our knowledge of the precise incidence and gravity of crime istherefore incomplete.     To remedy this, the Home Secretary in 1963appointed a committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Wilfred Perks,&quot;to consider and report what changes, if any, are desirable in existing arrangements in England and Wales for the recording and reporting, for statistical purposes, of information about criminal offences and proceedings, and about non-criminal proceedings inmagistrates&apos; courts and in the collection and presentation of statistics relating to these matters&quot;.     This committee, which includes members with wide experience of the compilation and useof criminal statistics, is at work on its important task.
III - The war against crimeThe Police8.     The latest developments in crime prevention and detectionare being harnessed to the drive against crimes which are&quot;becoming more complex year &quot;by year, and against criminals whouse new techniques and often a high decree of organisation.Detailed information about the work of the police and theprogress of police methods is published annually in the Reportsof Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectors of Constabulary and the Commissionof Police of the Metropolis.9.     In i960 a Royal Commission was set up, under the chair-manship of Sir Henry Willink, to review the constitutional position of the police throughout Great Britain, the arrangementsfor their control and administration, their relations with thepublic and the principles which should govern their pay.    Inits first report, later that year, the Commission recommended substantial increase in the pay of constables.    TheGovernment accepted, this recommendation, and the immediate result has been a marked and continuing improvement in recruiting.   At the end of \ 9&amp;0 there were 69,932 policemen inEngland and Jales;    on 31 st July 1963 there were 76,81).9*   Anadditional factor in this increase has &quot;been the centrallymounted press campaigns, the cost of which is shared betweenthe Central Government and the local authorities.   The first of these was held in the Spring of 1 962;    the second, which began in July 1963, is still in progress.    The net increase of(/7,O007 in police strength since 1960 has been invaluable, andthe majority of provinical forces all over the country are nowup to strcngthj   but in London and other large cities, wherethe competitive attractions of other employment are highest andwastage is heavy, many more police are still needed,/The Homo &apos;
The Home Secretary has declared that nothing would do more to stay the crime wave than the addition of another 1 0,000to police strength throughout England and Wales.10.    The increase in the number of police has been accompaniedby a review of establishments, to meet increasing crime and traffic needs.    The caseload of detective officers remainsvery heavy, but the strengthening in manpower has made it possible for many forces to allocate additional officers todetective work.    There has also been a considerable rise inthe number of civilians engaged on police work, and in newoffice equipment and other aids to efficiency.   Together,these measures enable an increasing proportion of police timeto be spent on the primary task of prevention and detection of crime.   The amount of attention the police have boon able togive to the regulation of traffic and the enforcement of the traffic laws has also increased steadily, as improved manpower-has &quot;been reflected in the employment of more men in trafficdepartments and on the beat,   A good beginning has also beenmade in the use of traffic wardens (first introduced at theend of i960) who aid the police in dealing with parkingoffences and certain other duties.   A further increase in thenumber of wardens and their introduction on a wider scaleoutside London are being planned.11.    The. Final Report of the Royal CommisBicn was presented in1962.   After extensive consultations with the representativesof police and local authority interests, the Home Secretarypresented in November 1963 the Police Bill now beforeParliament.    The traditional three-fold partnership of theSecretary of State, the police authorities and the service/itself
itself will remain, &quot;but some re-adjustment of the balancewithin the partnership is envisaged.    The Secretary of state will be given new responsibilities relating to the efficiency of provincial police forces.    In particular, it is proposedthat he should have power to require a police authority to effect the retirement of its chief constable in theinterests of efficiency;    to approve the appointment ofdeputy and assistant chief constables;    to call for reports from chief constables;    to set up local inquiries into any matter connected with the policing of any area:    and toensure that adequate arrangements are made for securingco-ordination of the work of police forces./ 12. Other
12. Other changes recommended by the Royal Commission havealready been made since 1962, without need for legislation.     a chief Inspector of Constabulary has been appointed, togetherwith two additional Inspectors;    and two more are to be appointed in the current year.     New offices have been established for the inspector, and staff officers and additional secretarial assistance have been provided;    this is to enable the Inspectorsto play an increasingly active part in keeping in close touchwith police forces, and to provide a closer link between theHome Office and the police.13. The increase in the complexity of crime and the methods ofcriminals has accentuated the importance of research into methodsof policing and equipment.     In accordance with a recommendationof the Royal Commission, a Police Research and Planning Branchhas been established under the direction of the Chief inspector of Constabulary.      Initially it is concentrating on means ofcombating the growing volume of serious and unsolved crime(particularly through the development of regional crime squads)?and &amp;n the best way or organising police resources to deal withthe problems of policing raised by modern road traffic, especially on motorways and trunk roads.1h. It is intensely important to attract into the police servicemen capable of becoming the senior officers of the future.     Aspart of a major re-organisation of the higher training of thepolice, young men of outstanding ability are now to be eligible,after three years service as a constable, to compete for places in a new special one-year course at the Police College.Successful completion of the course carries with it automaticpromotion;    and this opportunity of accelerated promotion will/help
help to attract more recruits of high quality.   In additionofficers of the rank of Inspector or above now have theopportunity of competing for selection for a new senior staffcourse at the College of six months&apos; duration.   By this meansoutstanding officers serving in the middle ranks are equipped for the highest posts in the Police Service.15.   In 1958-59? some  1,200,000 was spent in modernisingexisting buildings and providing new ones of better operational efficiency.   This is important if the service is to make thebest use of its resources.   By 1962-63 such expenditure had risen to  2+m., and this year it will be over  5m.   in parallel, substantial progress has also been made in providingmodern housing for the police and their families./ The co-operation
The ce-operation of the community16.   Effective prevention of criminal behaviour requires a jointeffort by all social agencies - statutory and voluntary - and indeed by the whole nation.     Accordingly in February 1959* onthe day *f publication mf &quot;Penal Practice in a Changing Society&quot;,the then Home Secretary convened a conference of church leaders and others prominent in public life and in voluntary service to the community, to consider how they could help to combatdelinquency and improve by positive measures the moral healthef the nation.     Another conference, ef a mere widely representative kind, took place in November 1961, which led tofurther discussions with representatives of the churches aboutthe ways in which their members might help.     Since then,  twelocal conferences on the problem of juvenile delinquency have beenheld, in Leeds and Preston.     They stimulated active local   .interest in the problem and in the need for co-operation between public and voluntary services in meeting it, and. both resultedin the establishment of representative committees to study thefacts of delinquency in the area and the &quot;best ways of usinglocal resources against it.17.    The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State far Scotlandhave recently taken the initiative in appointing a strong andwidely based Advisory Committee on Juvenile Delinquency &quot;toconsider and advise on the problems of juvenile delinquency andon measures for its reductien;t.     Taking the chair at its firstmeeting on-17th February 196U, the Home Secretary said:-/&quot;The formation
The formation of this committee is an experiment.With your help I mean to make it a dynamic experiment.We have had many official inquiries and advisory committeeshere ai the Home Office, hut this is the first where theHome Secretary has taken the chair himself in order todiscuss the problems regularly face to face with people from all parts of the country who have valuable first-hand knowledge of them.....There is another purpose I want this committee toserve.    Through it I want you to see the accumulatedknowledge and the resources of all Government Departmentsfocused on these problems of delinquency,....   I am sureyou will agree that the home and the family and thepersonality, the school, work or the lack of it,housing conditions and other local facts, all have tobe taken into account in striving to reduce delinquency.Our primary concern in this committee vd.ll be withthe reasons why boys and girls go wrong, and what canbe done about it, rather than with the methods of punishment after they have committed offences.....At each meeting we will put before you for discussionpapers and proposals on different aspects of thesepuzzling problems.   We shall make available to you allthe information we have, and welcome your suggestions.A great deal of research is going on, in the Home Officeand elsewhere;   we shall tell you about it and get youradvice about priorities......The extent of delinquency in this country and many other countries is a disgrace to our modern age.   But itis not enough to condemn it;   we must be sure we under-stand the causes of it.&quot;/lb. The Government
18c   The Government attaches special importance to the extensionof the powers of local authorities in the preventive field made&quot;by section 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act;, 1963,which came into force on 1st October 1963o   This makes it a duty of every county council and county borough council &quot;to make available such advice, guidance and assistance as may promote the welfare of children by diminishing the need to receivechildren into or keep them in care ... or to bring childrenbefore a juvenile court&quot;.     The section also empowers a localauthority to make arrangements for the provision of any of these services by voluntary organisations0     Local authorities havealready been attempting preventive work;      the expressstatutory authority now given will assist its continued expansion and development.19.   Under other statutes local authorities possess a wide range of powers which may contribute indirectly to the preventionof juvenile delinquency,,     Discussions between the Home Officeand the local authority associations have confirmed that no need is felt by local authorities for further powers to help them in combating delinquency,,/IV - Administration.
IV - Administration of justiceThe Streatfeil^Cojmmittee report20,    The 1959 White Paper recorded the appointment of acommittee under the chairmanship of Mr, Justice Streatfeildto review the arrangements for &quot;bringing to trial personscharged with criminal offences, and for providing the courtswith the information necessary to enable them to select themost appropriate treatment for offenders.    The committee reported in 1961*.   In Part A of their report they made recommendations to secure that no one should normally have to waitmore than eight weeks after committal for trial.    Theseproposals have been implemented by the Criminal JusticeAct 1962, under three bread headings.21 .   ,First, courts of quarter sessions are now free to arrangetheir business in the v/ay best calculated to achieve speed inits despatch, instead of being tied by statute^ restrict j onsas to the times of their sittings.   Parallel arrangements have been made to modernise the despatch of business at assizes.22,    Secondly, extended use is made of the Convenient court&apos;procedure, so that cases are committed for trial at a courtwhich is in a better position to deal with them quickly, ifdelay is likely to result from committal to the normal courtof trial for the area,23,    Thirdly, changes have been made in the jurisdiction of courts, so as to ease the burden of work.    Some offencesformerly triable only at assizes (e.g, bigamy) may now be triedat quarter sessions;    and some offences formerly triable only onindictment may now be tried summarily in magistrates&apos; courts(notably, offences of breaking into premises other than dwelling houses)./2k5&apos;:Report of the Interdepartmental Committee on the Business ofthe Criminal Courts (Cmnd. 1289)
ft2h.   Part B of the Streatfeild Report was concerned with thesupply of information about offenders to the courts to enablethem to decide upon the most suitable forms of treatment.The Committee&apos;s recommendations aimed to secure that courts aregiven full information about the background of offenders by those best qualified to supply it, that the various reports are co-ordinated, and that they are submitted in time toensure that, wherever possible, sentence follows immediately on conviction.   The recommendations have been brought intoeffect by Home Office circulars.25.   The Committee also recommended that &quot;all who have responsibility for passing sentence should be systematicallyprovided with a booklet giving comprehensive information, forevery form of sentence, about what it involves, what it is .designed to achieve and what it in fact achieves, togetherwith information about research into the result of sentences&quot;.In respense to this recommendation, the first edition of sucha booklet is about to be issued by the Home Office.The Judges&apos; Rules26,   In taking statements from persons in custody or suspected of crime, the police have hitherto been guided by Rules framed bythe Judges in 1912 and 1918.   The purpose of these Rules has been to ensure that any statements are made voluntarily.   As a resultof representations made from various quarters about the workingof the existing Rules, discussions took place in 1961 between the then Home Secretary, the Lord Chief Justice and the Chairman of theRoyal Commission on the Police, as a result of which the lord chief Justice agreed that the Judges should review the Rules.   this review has been completed, and revised Rules, promulgated by the judges on 20th January, came into force on/--27th January, 1961)..-/The powers
The powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal27o   Ever since 1907 the possibility of empowering the Courtof Criminal Appeal to order a new trial in appropriate caseshas been a matter of controversy.     Widely differing viewshave however been expressed about the case for making a changein the law, and about the form which any change should take.The Government in the present session of Parliament has brought forward a Bill to empower the Court of Criminal Appeal to order a new trial where fresh evidence is submitted to it which appearsto justify this course;    and it is hoped that this will become law shortly.The jury system28.    The existing law and practice in regard to jury service is of great antiquity.     The qualifications which have to besatisfied before a person is included in the jury list are quiteunrelated to modern conditions;    one effect of them is thatcomparatively few women are eligible to serve.     In May 1963the Home Secretary accordingly appointed a departmental committee under the chairmanship of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest &quot;to inquire into the law and practice in England and Wales regarding the qualifications for, exemptions from, and conditions of juryservice, and related matters;    and to make recommendations&quot;.The Committee is expected to report before the end of 196L.Administration of justice in London29o   The reorganisation of local government in Greater Londonbrought about by the London Government Act 1963, made it necessaryto review the arrangements for the administration of justice inthe Metropolis,      In this review account has been taken of therecommendations of a committee appointed by the Home secretary and the Lord Chancellor which, sitting under the chairmanship of the Common Serjeant, Judge Aarvold, considered the integrationinto a single system of the stipendiary magistrates&apos;  courts andthose formed by the lay justices in central London*,      A bill is/now*Cmnd. 1606 January 1962.
now before Parliament to provide broadly for the extension of thejurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court to the whole of theGreater London area:    for the commission of the peace,  quarter sessions and magistrates&apos; courts committees throughout greater london,    and for the development in Inner London - for the first time - of a fully integrated system of stipendiary and laymagistrates,Court Buildings30.   With the growth of crime and the consequent increase in thework of the courts, many court buildings throughout the country are no longer adequate to meet the demands upon them.   Older courthouses are frequently lacking in proper ancillary accommodation for those attending the courts, and many courts ere required to sit in temporary premises far from ideal for the purpose.   The capital investment programme for the provision by local authorities of newcourt buildings has been greatly increased in the past five years.In 1959 a start on court building schemes totalling 5k3,000 was authorised;    in the current year, some 53 schemes totallingLI4.6,000 have been approved.   Many more such projects are planned.31*   The Aarvold Committee recommended a substantial programme   forreplacing court buildings in London.   While juvenile and adultcourts should continue to have separate accommodation, itrecommended that on grounds of both convenience and economy,they should be housed under the same roof.   The Government have accepted these recommendations, and in new Courts built under thelong-term building programme in London adult and juvenile courtswill be in the same buildings.   Meanwhile, vigorous short-term measures are being taken in London to improve court accommodation and to lessen the time that elapses before a case can be heard.
V - The criminal law32.    The White Paper of 1959 referred to the need to ensurethat criminals do not escape punishment &quot;because of defects in the criminal law, and announced the appointment of a StandingCommittee on Criminal Law Revision under the chairmanship ofLord Justice Sellers.     The committee have already submittedreports, accompanied by draft Bills, on indecency with children:suicide:    the order of speeches in criminal proceedings:    andthe procedure for dealing with persons found insane when brought before the Courts on a criminal charge.     Two of the draft Billshave reached the statute book, as the Indecency with ChildrenAct i960, and the Suicide Act 1961.     The third, dealing with theorder of speeches in criminal proceedings, is the subject of aBill now before Parliament; and the report containing thefourth - the Criminal Procedure (insanity) Bill - is underconsideration.     The Committee is completing its work on the major task of revising the law of larceny;    and the HomeSecretary in 1963 referred to it for consideration the questionwhether any amendment of the law is desirable to facilitate thecontinuance of a trial where a member of the jury dies or is forany reason discharged:    the law relating to perjury;    and the lawconcerning the attendance of witnesses at criminal trials.33.    The systematic review of branches of the criminal lawundertaken by the Criminal Law Revision Committee is one part,and one part only, of the task of bringing the criminal lawup-to-date.     Parliament itself has been engaged on a large scale in modernising old legislation not sufficiently related to present-day needs.     In the past five years the StreetOffences Act 1959? the Betting and Gaming Act 1960, and the licensing Act 1961 have all been enacted, each of them makingmajor changes in old legislation which had become unacceptableand difficult to enforce.     In addition, a Departmental Committeeis sitting under the chairmanship of Lord Crathorne to enquire into the law relating to Sunday Observance.
i VI - Research3U.   Criminological research is essential to the battleagainst crime.   Its ultimate purpose is to discover how crimecan be reduced;    but there are many routes to this end, andthe field for valuable research is extensive.    It is necessaryto obtain a better understanding of the nature of criminality;to study statistics and the realities which lie behind them;to examine crime in detail and to evolve ways of accuratelydescribing and measuring it.35.   Next, the social and psychological aspects of criminalitymust be investigated.   Delinquent behaviour must be studied in the framework of normal behaviour in order that knowledgeof its causes may be gradually built up.   Ways of preventingcrime among both juveniles and adults must be explored, andexperiments carried out to test theories about acxions whichmight reduce juvenile delinquency.36k   Finally, examination needs to be made of the effects onoffenders of the different sentences which can be passed bythe courts, and of the different v/ays in which treatment canbe carried out within the penal system, so that, as far as maybe, the amount of recidivism can be reduced.
37*   At the time of the 1939 White Paper, consideration wasbeing given to the establishment of an Institute ofCriminology at Cambridge.    In i960 the Institute was established,with the help of a generous grant from the Wolfson Foundation.The Wolfson Professorship of Criminology was created, and is held by Professor Leon Eadzinowicz, also Director of the institute;   These developments mark a most important advance in the study and teaching of criminology.   Besides carrying out a programme of research, the institute conducts     post-graduatecourses in crimonology, and has held advanced vacation courses in criminology for persons working in the field of delinquency.38,   In other ways also the amount and intensity of research on delinquency and the treatment of offenders has greatlyincreased in the last few years.   The Home Office ResearchUnit now has a staff of 23 qualified reseach workers, with appropriate supporting staff.   Home Office grants forcriminological research work in universities have increasedto more than  50,000 a year.   Even with these enhancedresources, rapid progress cannot be expected because researchprojects in this field are inevitably complex and take timeto complete, and because there is a nationwide shortage of well qualified persons wishing to engage in scientificcriminological research.   But substantial progress has alreadybeen made    a list of completed reports on research carriedout-   by the Home Office or supported by Home Office grant ssince 1959 is given in Appendix A.
39.    The work still in progress covers an equally wide field.The Home Office Research Unit is concentrating on research into the treatment of offenders.    These studies are dividedinto three groups.    The first consists primarily of examining a large number of criminal histories with the objectof relating the recorded information about offenders to the degree of success which different sentences have had in preventing or retarding further offences.    The results of \this research should be of use not only to the Courts when considering what sentence they should pass, but to theGovernment in deciding what forms of treatment should bemade available to the Courts.ho.    The second group of studies is being carried outwithin the probation service.    One of its objects is toexamine the working of probation, including the many different(and some new) ways of dealing with probationers which areavailable.    Another is to investigate variations in treatment,so as to obtain more information about the kind of treatment which may most profitably be given to any particularoffender.    There is reason to hope that the results of this work will be capable of being generalised so as to shedlight on the interaction between types of offender and types of treatment other than probation.    In addition there isa third group consisting of miscellaneous investigations.Particulars of all the studies now being carried out by theHome Office Research Unit are given in Appendix B.1+1.    In the universities a wide variety of criminologies!research is being financed by Home Office grants.    studies of juvenile delinquency and of techniques for investigatingit are among the projects undertaken by Cambridge University/and
mand the London School of Economics.     Oxford, Nottingham,Manchester, Leicester and Durham Universities and university college and Birkbeck College, London, are all undertaking research on particular aspects of crime and its treatment.     /Fullerparticulars are given in Appendix 0^7*      The Home Secretary is anxious to give every encouragement to high-quality criminologicalresearch in the universities and, as the number of universitiesincreases, he hopes that correspondingly more research studieswill be undertaken in fields having a bearing on the causes andprevention of delinquency.h2.    To co-ordinate research activities and to bring in outsideexperience from different fields in planning future research,he has invited a number of leading research workers to form,with representatives of the Home Office, a new committee toadvise him on criminological research.h3.   Following the second conference mentioned in&apos;paragraph 16above, the Independent Television Authority offered to financeresearch into the impact of television on society, with particular reference to its effect on the young.     This offer was gladlyaccepted, and the Home Secretary in 19&amp;3 appointed a committee under the chairmanship of the Vice Chancellor of LeicesterUniversity, Mr. T. A. F. Noble,&quot;to initiate and co-ordinate research into the part whichtelevision plays or could play, in relation to otherinfluences, as a medium of communication and in fosteringattitudes, with particular reference to the ways in whichyoung people&apos;s moral concepts and attitudes develop andthe processes of perception through which they areinfluenced by television and other media of communication;and to administer any funds made available to it for suchresearch&quot;.The Committee&apos;s work, which will clearly take some years for itsfulfilment, should lead to results of great and lasting value.
VII - The Treatment of offendersChanges in the law kh*    Since 1959 important changes have &quot;been made in the powersavailable to the courts for dealing with young offenders.     the criminal Justice Act 1961 implemented recommendations in thereports of a Departmental Committee^ of which Lord Ingleby waschairman, and of the inquiry conducted by Mr. Victor Durand, Q.G.,into disturbances at the Carlton Approved School/-     tfhe maximumlimits on fines for juvenile offenders were raised;    and theminimum age for attendance at an attendance centre was reduced from 12 to 10.     Changes were made in the period and conditionsof after-care for boys and girls released from approved schools:the temporary removal of unruly or subversive pupils, and thetransfer to borstal of those who could not benefit from approvedschool training or interfered with the training of others, were provided for:    and the Home Secretary was empowered to give directions on the management of approved schools, and to regulate the constitution of voluntary managing bodies.     These provisionscame into force on 2nd October 1961.1+5.   The Act of 1961 also reduced from 16 to 15 the minimum age at which a sentence of borstal training can be imposed.     Thiswas brought into force on 1st August 1963.     The Children and young Persons Act 1963, referred to in paragraph 18 above,provides also for the raising of the age of criminalresponsibility from 8 to 10, and for many other changes in thelaw relating to children in care, or the treatment of delinquentchildren.     Most of these new provisions came into force on1st February 196I4.,I4.6,    The Criminal Justice Act 1961 also established the borstalsystem as the principal form of medium term institutuinal/treatment for*Cmnd, 1191, October, i960./Cmnd. 931, January, i960.
0treatment for offenders between the ages of 17 and 21, and for those aged 15 and 16 who are not considered suitable forcommittal to an approved school.     As from 1st August 1963,imprisonment for offenders under 17 was abolished.Imprisonment for those aged 17 to 21 is now restricted tosentences of up to six months or more than three years (exceptfor offenders who have already served or are serving a sentence of imprisonment of six months or of more than three years (excepttraining;    these may &quot;be sentenced to imprisonment for eighteen months or more, as well as to terms of six months or less).The Home Secretary&apos;s purpose is that eventually detention ina detention centre shall entirely replace short sentences of imprisonment for this age group;    and the Act containsprovision for the abolition by order of sentences of imprison-ment of up to six months.     For certain especially graveeffences, a court may order an offender under 17 years of age to be detained for a specified period in such place and onsuch conditions as the Home Secretary may determine./Preventive detention
127Preventive detentionkl *    The 1959 White Paper foreshadowed a review of the sentence of preventive detention.     This has since &quot;been carried out bythe Home Secretary&apos;s Advisory Council on the Treatment of offenders, who had the benefit of the results of researchconducted by the Home Office Research Unit and the CambridgeInstitute of Criminology,     In a report published in 1963 theCouncil recommended that preventive detention should be abolished, and that instead the courts should be empowered toimpose longer sentences of imprisonment on certain types ofpersistei-t offenders.     The Council also made recommendations about the type of prison regime and after-care suitable forpersistent offenders.if,   As an interim measure, they recommended abolition of thesystem by which selected preventive detention prisoners were released after serving two-thirds of their sentence, whereas theremainder had to serve five-sixths.     The Council proposed thatall should be eligible, like ordinary prisoners, for releaseafter two-thirds.     This change was put into effect last yearby an amendment of the Prison Rules.     Their other recommen-dations, some of which could not be implemented without legislation, are under consideration by the Home Secretary.Probationh9o   A thorough review of the present service was made by theDepartmental Committee on the Probation Service under theChairmanship of Sir Ronald Morison, Q.C., whose reports were published in March and August 1962 (Cmnd, 1650 and 180$),Many of the Committee&apos;s recommendations have already been implemented.     In particular, salaries are being raisedsubstantially, in three stages concluding on 1st December 196h,to the new levels recommended by the Committee,     A ProbationAdvisory and Training Board has been constituted on the lines proposed, with the Vice-Chancellor of Leicester University as/independent
128independent chairman.     With the Board&apos;s help, the number of students in training was increased by one-third during 1963, andtraining facilities have been extended to provide for theincreased numbers.     Probation students&apos; grants have been improved.50.    Pour additional probation inspectors have been appointed,to enable more frequent inspections to be made and to carry outthe extended programme of recruitment and training for probationwork which is essential if the service is to meet the increasing demands made upon it.     The strength of the service has increased from 1,600 at the end of 1958 to over 2,000;    this was the figureproposed as a first target by the Morison Committee, and theintention is to hit the second target (2,750) during 1966,51.    The Administration of Justice Bill now before Parliamentgives effect to the recommendation that responsibility for the probation service in London should be transferred from theSecretary of State to a Probation Committee composed ofrepresentatives of the courts.Tra,ining of . Ypjjng,jOf f enderg52.   A detailed description of recent developments relating tojuveniles will be found in the triennial Report of the Children&apos;department of the Home Office.     Others will be described in theforthcoming report on the work of the Prison Department (seeparagraph 55 below).     Suffice it to say here that in 1960 theHome Office launched a large-scale building programme for approved&quot;schools, designed to produce more places tc meet the risingdemand, and to continue the much-needed modernisation and improvement of many existing schools.     The object is to provideby 1966 some 2,000 more places than were available in 1958 - anincrease of about 25^,     The Central Council for Child Care has undertaken responsibility for organising the training of approvedschool and remand home staff.
12953.    In 1959 there were two senior and two junior detention centres for boys, with a total capacity at any one time of about275o     Now there are eleven senior and three junior centres forboys, with a capacity of over 1,200, and two more centres willbe opened in the near future.     There is also a centre for 25girls.5h.    The building of new premises for borstal training has also made good progress.     Three closed and two open borstals forboys, offering 1,000 additional places, have been completed;and one further closed borstal with 300 places is being provided.Prisons55. On 1st April 1963 the Prison Commission became the PrisonDepartment of the Home Office, Beginning with the Report for1963, which will appear shortly, it will in future be the HomeSecretary who will present to Parliament the annual report on/the work
the work of what is now the Prison Department,     Briefly, from1956 to the middle of 1962 there was a continuing and rapid risein the number in prison.     Faced with this situation, theGovernment felt no doubt that it was necessary to give priority in the use of resources - both buildings and staff - to the young offenders;    the local prisons for adults became gravelyovercrowded, and suffered until recently from a serious shortageof staff, now being overcome.56.  Despite all difficulties, much progress has &quot;been made.The great improvement in the recruitment of prison staff, and theopening of the new prisons included in the building programme,have laid foundations for further advances in the treatment of adult offenders.     The outstanding objects of the Home Secretarynow are to enable prisoners in the local prisons to do something more like a full week&apos;s work (a valuable report just submitted bythe Advisory Council on Employment for Prisoners will help inthis):    to eliminate the necessity for prisoners to sleep threein a cell (the number of these has been brought down frcm 8,600to 6,300 over the past year);    to improve the training facilitiesfor long-term prisoners:    and to establish on a comprehensivebasis a sound system of after-care.Af te^r-care57,    The Criminal Justice Act 1961 provided for a considerableextension of compulsory after-care to (among others) personsreleased after serving a sentence of imprisonment of four years or more and persons released from detention centres;    the HomeSecretary by order brought the latter into effect on 1st January196L.     Meanwhile the Advisory Council on the Treatment of offenders were asked, having regard to these developments, to/review
review the arrangements for the organisation of statutory and voluntary after-care for persons discharge from prisons,borstals, detention centres and approved schools,580   In their report published in October 1 9&amp;3, the majorityof the Council recommended that after-care in the community should be undertaken by an expanded and reorganised probationand after-care service, and that the social workers who areconcerned with the welfare of persons in custody and with theirpreparation for release should beccme members of the prison service,59*   The Home Secretary announced on 3rd December 1963 theGovernments acceptance of these important and forward lookingproposals.   The Council themselves recognised that the developments which they propose must extend over a periodof years.   Time will be needed to recruit and train the staff required for the expanded probation and after-care service(the urgent needs of the existing probation service forfurther recruits must not be forgotten), and there must be close consultation with the many bodies - probation committees,local authorities staff associations, voluntary organisations and others - whose co-operation will be essential for thesuccess of this new venture.   It may well be necessary, as theCouncil contemplate, to proceed by stages and to introduce the new arrangements area by area as soon as local circumstancesmake this possible.60.   The Council pay a tribute, in which the Government are glad to join, to the part which has hitherto been played by voluntaryeffort in the field of after-care and rehabilitation of offenders.They emphasise that it is essential for the success of their proposals that probation and after-care officers should havethe help of trained voluntary workers, and they hope to seeencouragements and expansion of the contribution made by religious/bodies
&quot;bodies and voluntary organisations - for example, by work withprisoners&apos; families, and by provision of clubs for the lonely andhostels for the homeless or for those who otherwise need thesupport, of a residential institution, perhaps for a long period after their release.     The Government cordially shares theCouncil&apos;s views on these matters, and in particular on theimportance of the general public understanding more fully thepart which they can play in the rehabilitation of offenders.Time for ja Fundamental Review61.   Are our existing penal methods producing good enoughresults?     Few would answer &quot;yes&quot; to that question with fullassurance.     To take but one instance, the falling success rateof boys coming out of approved schools must givs ground for concern - and the reason for it may be partly that the devotedmanagers and staffs of the schools are having to deal with boysand girls who are less responsive to training than they used tobe.62.   Are we doing enough to devise and experiment with new methods of treatment?     Are we concentrating overmuch on seeking to improve the traditional methods?     To these questions there isno simple answer, but in the present upsurge of crime anddelinquency they ought to be asked.63.    Moreover, are the traditional methods closely enough linkedtogether?     In the case of the young a variety of treatments hasbeen developed separately, under different auspices.     Is thisdispersion a good thing, or not?     Probation is the responsibilityof the magistrates;    attendance centres of the State, actingmainly through the police:    remand homes of the local authorities:detention centres of the State, acting through the PrisonDepartment of the Home Office:    approved schools partly of thelocal authorities and partly of voluntary managers:   borstals of/the State
the State.     All of these now have a long enough history to beworthy of stocktaking inquiry by an objective and authoritativebody which can form an overall view.6k.    The fundamental review of the whole penal system for which,in the Government&apos;s view, the time is now ripe is of such importance and magnitude that it needs to be carried out by a royal Commission.     A purpose will be to reassess the value ofour penal system as it has been built up until now - but muchmore than that.     With that as the background, it is the timefor a deep study of the philosophy underlying the system - todetermine afresh what we ought to be seeking to achieve, toexamine how far and in what manner the results of our present practice fall short, and to sift new ideas in order to judgewhich of them appear both constructive and practicable inoperation.65.    The Government has therefore decided to set up a RoyalCommission.     They will invite it to survey the whole fieldbut, if it thinks fit, to drav/ up in advance of its final reportan interim report concentrating on offenders under 21 and theirtreatment.     A great many adults who have systematically takento a life of crime appeared before juvenile courts when theywere younger.       Therefore every improvement we can achieve inthe handling of the young offender is a valuable step gained inthe advance against adult crime.66,   The terms of reference proposed for the Royal commission are:&quot;In the light of modern knowledge of crime and modernpenal practice here and abroad, to re-examine the conceptsand purposes which should underlie the punishment and/treatment
134treatment of offenders in England and Wales:    to reporthow far they are realised by the penalties and methods oftreatment available to the courts, and whether any changesin these, or in the arrangements and responsibility forassigning particular offenders to particular methods oftreatment, are desirable:    to review the work of theservices and institutions providing treatment, and theresponsibility for their administration:    and to make recommendations.&quot;Its reports should be a landmark in penal history.67.    To sum up, a study has been initiated of the criminalstatistics - the means whereby the incidence and gravity of crime are measured.     Research into the causes of crime and the effectiveness of the means of dealing with the criminals is going ahead.     The modernisation of the criminal law, with the help of the Criminal Law Revision Committee and other bodies, isbeing pressed onward.     The police service has been greatly strengthened, and the enlarged Inspectorate and the new PoliceResearch and Planning Branch at the Home Office will enhancepolice efficiency for the dual task of preventing crime anddetecting offenders.     A new committee under the Home Secretary&apos;chairmanship will bring together for regular practical discussiona wide-ranging body of people with first-hand experience of theproblems of young misbehaviour.     A Royal Commission will undertake a fundamental review and reassessment of our penalsystem.     None of this will hold up the steady improvements instaffing and in buildings which are now going on.     Taken alltogether, it represents a comprehensive and formidable armouryfor fighting the war against crime.

60     &quot;Murder&quot;, Report No. k in the Home Office series of Studiesin the Causes of Delinquency and the Treatment of Offenders,H.M.S.O. 1961.     This report is based on a statistical enquirybeginning with deaths initially recorded by the police as murdersand following them through to the final decision reached, and includes an analysis of the types of victim and the types ofmurderer concerned.     Its object is to give a perspective viewof the subject over recent years, with special attention to theeffect of the changes made by the Homicide Act 1957*7.     &quot;Attendance Centres&quot;, by F. H. McClintock, published as no. XIII in the series &quot;Cambridge Studies in Criminology&quot;,(Macmillan 196l).     This study, based mainly on research carriedout at 9 attendance centres, sets out to discover the considerations which led to the introduction of attendance centres in the criminla justice Act 19^85   how courts used their powers to make orders for compulsory attandance at a centre;   how the centres were run-,   and how effective they were in preventing further offences.8.     &quot;Robbery in London&quot;, by F. H. McClintock and Mrs. E. H. Gibson,published as No. XIV in the series &quot;Cambridge Studies in Criminology&quot;(Macmillan i96i).     This investigation deals with all offences of robbery reported within the Metropolitan Police District in 1950,1957 and the first half of i960, and attempts to give a balancedview of the changes which have been taking place, and to assess the real gravity of this group of offences.     It also includes a study of the backgrounds of offenders and the way in which theywere dealt with by the courts.9.     &quot;Sentencing in Magistrates&apos; Courts&quot;, by Roger Hood,published as No. 7 in the Library of Criminology (L.S.E.)(Stevens 1962).

This survey, based on information collected from employers in Reading, investigates the attitudes and practices of employers (a) towards the engaging of men convicted of criminal offences and (b) towards men already in their employment who were suspected or convicted of committing criminal offences.12,    &quot;The Homosexual Society&quot;, by R. Hauser (The Bodley Head, 1962).This is an exploratory study, based mainly on group interviews, ofaspects of homosexual life.     It attempts to distinguish various types of homosexual, discusses their family and social relation-ships and the homosexuals&apos; views of their own problems, and makessuggestions both for the prevention of homosexuality and for enabling homosexuals to adjust themselves more easily to the &apos;community.13.   &quot;Persistent Criminals&quot;, Report No. 5 in the Home Office seriesof Studies in the Causes of Delinquency and the Treatment of offenders. (H.M.S.O. February, 1963).     This study consists of an examination of the criminal histories of all men who were liableto preventive detention in 1956 and compares the characteristics of the small proportion of those offenders who were actuallysentenced to preventive detention with others who received sentencesvarying from discharge to long-term imprisonment.     It also triesto relate a number of social and personal factors to preventivedetainees&apos; chances of selection for hostel places and early release,and to their progress after serving their sentence./Ik.

This descriptive survey of a hundred recidivists, half ofwhom were serving sentences of preventive detention, combinesfindings from psychiatric interviews, scrutiny of prison records and the results of psychological tests*15*   The Home Office Research Unit has also completed research -and its results may shortly be published - on the criteria bywhich problem families are selected as such by the London CountyCouncil.     A special group in which child delinquency occurredwas distinguished by criminal records of parents or siblings andpromiscuity among parents, but not by othei factors./APPENDIX b
APPENDIX BCurrent Research by the Home Office Research Unit^&quot;     Probation ResearchThis has been divided into five sub-projects as follows:(i) A study of Criteria of Successful Treatment of Offenders.The majority of research projects involving evaluation oftreatment have considered the subsequent behaviour of offendersonly in terms of further convictions.     The purpose of this studyis to check whether such criteria are adequate or whether a bettermeasuring instrument is required which will, if possible, give a scale of degrees of success of the outcome of treatment.(ii) Prior-probabilities Study (Prediction)The object is to estimate probabilities of recidivism inrespect of individual offenders.(iii) Operational research the purpose of this part of the project is to study modifica-tions of the present techniques of probation case work in various ways in various areas.(iv) Classification of OffendersThis study aims at assisting the selection of treatment foroffenders by providing data on the varying responses to particulartypes of treatment of different classes of offenders.(v) Types of treatment on probationThe aims of this sub-project are to identify and describedifferent types of probation treatment so that these may be related to types of offenders (sub-project iv), with a view to finding themost effective forms of treatment for particular types.B.     Research on Approved schools the object of this research is to investigate the effects ofvarious kinds of training on different types of offenders committed to approved schools.Sovoral exploratory projects have been started:(a)   A statistical reconviction study, based on a follow-up of thewhole 1956 intake;/(b)
lift(b) A study of vocational training;(c) A study of the development of an Approved School Hostel;(d) A study of staff conceptions of the Approved School system;and(e) A joint project in collaboration with the psychologists onthe staffs of classifying schools, to investigate and developmethods of diagnosis on which recommendations for treatment maybe made.C0     General studies of criminal histories and the effectiveness of different treatmentsThe main aims are:   (i) to study criminal careers and patterns of offending at all stages with special reference to predictingthe continuance of criminality;   (ii) if possible to establishnorms (i.e. assessments of vulnerability to subsequent reconvic-tion) of different offender groups;   and (iii) to study methodsof analysing biographical data.     The information obtained under(i) and (ii), together with social information, is being used to predict the number of reconvictions to be expected from the natureof the offenders whatever sentence they are given;   the actualnumbers reconvicted following any sentence are then compared withthe expected numbers in order to assess whether the particularsentence results in fewer or more reconvictions than could beexpected from the types of offender concerned.The material being used for these studies includes:    (a) allScottish first offenders in 19^7;    (b) all offenders recorded atthe Criminal Record Office as committing an offence in theMetropolitan Police Division during March or April 1957;    (c) alloffenders liable to preventive detention in England and Wales in1956;    (d) juvenile offenders in the Metropolitan area born in19^6;    (e) all offenders liable to preventive detention in 1956.1.     Three studies on first offenders have now been completed:(a) a comparison of English and Scottish Offenders;    (b) a comparison of treatments given to juveniles;   and (c) a comparison of treatments given to adults.
2.     Studies of female offenders(i) A separate study has been made of the female offenders in theMetropolitan area, with special reference to the incidence of crime at different ages;   this study also included a five yearfollow up of the sentences given in 1957*(ii) Women discharged from prisons and borstalsThis is a general descriptive study of women prisoners andborstal detainees with particular reference to the factors affectingreconviction, based on women discharged from prisons and borstalsin 1953./D.
D. Special studies of institutional treatments

Studies of the following special treatments have been undertaken, making use of the methods or results of the research referred to at paragraph C.1 above.

(i) Comparative Study of Offenders Serving First and Second Prison Sentences

The object is to predict recidivism from the factors which differentiate the two groups.

(ii) Pentonville Project

This study was intended as a pilot investigation into changes in prisoners&apos; social attitudes during their sentence at Pentonville. Prisoners were interviewed shortly after reception and as many as possible were re-interviewed after a year in prison.

(iii) Research into the effectiveness of Prison Hostel Schemes

Research on the use of these hostels has started with an analysis of information already recorded for men who have passed through them and for those who were eligible but not chosen for hostels. Work record as well as absence of reconviction is being considered as a measure of the success of the hostel scheme.

(iv) Manchester Senior Attendance Centre: study of the first three years&apos; intake with a follow-up after one year

The boys sent to this centre have been studied to determine the types of boy being sent there and this information, together with a follow-up of convictions, is being used in an attempt to establish a prediction formula for use with subsequent intakes.

E. Other studies

(i) Study of the criteria of successful treatment of offenders (see also A(i) above)

One of the aims of the various researches reported has been to evolve new criteria of the success of treatments to supplement or, in some cases, to replace the criterion of further convictions /which
which is generally used for this purpose.     Two approaches arebeing followed;   one is to attempt to find out how far the objectives of the case workers or of those responsible fortrying out the treatments in&apos; the various fields are achieved,so that, if possible, a scale of degrees of success of the outcome of treatments can be produced;   the second is toproduce an assessment of the offender&apos;s social adjustment withspecial reference to his stability in employment before andafter the treatment.(ii) National Survey^ of Child iIfeialthian^d ^velpfiment&apos;(see also Appendix C item (b)jThe Research Unit is participating in the National survey of Child Health and Development which is being carried out (withthe aid in part of a Home Office grant) by Dr. Douglas of theLondon School of Economics.     In an attempt to find causes ofdelinquency by contrasting delinquents with others, information is being obtained about delinquents from amongst a sample ofabout 5,000 children born in the first week in Marchwhose records have been kept from birth,(iii) Prediction FormulaeA study is being made of data relating to borstal boys and young prisoners, to see what predictions can be made for allthese boys jointly and to what extent these may be modified by the form of treatment that they were given.New methods of analysis of the data, including methodsdevised at Southampton University by Professor Williams andother methods developed within the Home Office Research Unit,have been applied to the data, and promising results have beenobtained.(iv) Continuous jire^otion iof Borstal jtoyjjThis project was devised to make possible a continuous review of borstal prediction methods, showing what revision of/the
144the &quot;prediction tables&quot; was necessary and plotting changes inthe sort of material received into borstals.     Since 1958 informa-tion believed to be prognostic of the outcome of borstal training has been obtained on all boys passing through the AllocationCentres.     This information includes all items in the originalprediction table, and additional items which may i.i the futureprove to be useful for prognosis.(v) Polmont BorstalA study is being made of the attitudes of inmates of PolmontBorstal Scotland, to those around them in the institution.     the study is in collaboration with Professor F. Fielder of IllinoisUniversity.(vi) Study of AdolescentsAs part of a series of studies on social mobility carriedout by the London School of Economics about 10 years ago, the behaviour, school performance, hopes and fears, personality, andattitudes of some 600 boys were examined.     The Home Office ResearchUnit, in collaboration with Dr. H.
