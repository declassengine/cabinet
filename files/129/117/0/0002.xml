tlS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJSSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C P. (64) 5219th February, 1964:ofy no, .SicabinetRESALE PRICES bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry,Trade and Regional development at our meeting on 15th January, it was agreed that legislation shouldbe introduced in the current Session to make resale price maintenanceillegal, subject to the provision of a right to apply to a judicial tribunal for exemption (CM, (64) 4th Conclusions, Minute 1).    With my colleaguesapproval I accordingly made a statement in Parliament which included thefollowing: -&quot;I come finally to resale price maintenance.    The government believe that this practice is in general incompatible with their objective of encouraging effective competition and keeping downcosts and prices.   They have reached the conclusion thatresale price maintenance should be presumed to be againstthe public interest unless in any particular case it is proved to the contrary to the satisfaction of a judicial tribunal.     they therefore propose to introduce legislation this session designedto bring the practice to an end subject to the right to apply for exemption to the judicial tribunal to which I have referred. &quot;2.       The text of the Resale Prices Bill which I shall introduce into theHouse of Commons on Tuesday next has already been circulated (C. P. (64)53)for the information of the Cabinet.     The Bill has been considered by a group of Ministers including the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney General.I apologise to have to ask my colleagues to take this paper with less thanthe usual notice, due to the need to consider the reprint of the Bill afterthe last meeting of the group.What the Bill does where r.p.m. is prohibited3.       The Bill makes it unlawful for any supplier of goods which are notexempted from the prohibition to fix a price below which the goods may not4.      A supplier will, however, still be free to fix (and enforce) amagjgnurn^ resale price for his goods.    He will also be free to recommendan appropriate resale price.5.       But he will not be allowed to enforce a recommended price by with-holding supplies of goods from a trader who sells below the recommendedprice.    Nor will he be able to seek to achieve the same object by treatingsuch a trader less favourably than he treats other traders (e. g. by refusinghim discounts because he has been selling below the recommended price).In all other respects the supplier will of course remain free to choose hisdealers as he pleases.-1-
6.       There is, however, one case (apart from exempted goods) wherethe supplier will be entitled to withhold supplies from a trader who iscutting prices.    This is where the trader is using goods as loss leaders,i. e.is selling the goods at or below the price he paid for them.7.       I have included this provision with some hesitation.    To judgeby the experience of other countries and our own experience in groceries,loss leadering is not likely to present a real problem.    I do not there-fore regard a safeguard against loss leadering as necessary, but Ibelieve it expedient to provide one.8.      Breach of the provisions of the Bill has not been made a criminal offence but the Crown will be able to enforce compliance by civil proceedings for an injunction.    The Crown has to show in such proceedings that supplies of goods are being withheld from a trader whois a customer and has been selling below the supplier&apos;s resale price.&quot;vYhen this has been established, it is presumed that such selling is thereason for the withholding.    But it is open to the supplier to rebut thepresumption by proving that some other ground is the real reason for supplies being withheld.Provision for exemption from the prohibition9.       The tribunal for dealing with applications for exemption will bethe restrictive Practices Court.   The number of judges will beincreased to deal with these applications.10.      Manufacturers (and other suppliers) who are practising resale price maintenance will be given a period of three months (four months from the date of enactment) in which to apply for exemption.    the registrar of Restrictive Trading Agreements is given power to assemblethe goods in respect of which applications for exemption a.re made intomanageable classes.11.      When an application for exemption has been made, retailers willhave a right of audience in the Court proceedings through a representative body, but they will not have a right of application on their own behalf.12.      When an application has been made and pending the decision of theCourt the prohibition on resale price maintenance will be suspended.   Ifthe application succeeds the goods in question v/ill be freed from theprohibition.    If it does not, the prohibition will come into operation.13.      There is provision for decisions of the Court, either way, to be reviewed after two years if there has been a material change in circumstances.14.      The grounds on which exemption may be sought have been deliberately constructed in such a way as to allow the argumentsnormally put forward in justification of resale price maintenance by those v/ho practise it to be pleaded before the Court.    Briefly, theparties are allowed to show that, if resale price maintenance wereended in respect of the goods in question, consumers would sufferdetriment by reason of:-
(i)  substantial reduction in the variety or quality of thegoods;  or(ii) loss of retail outlets causing severe inconvenience;or(iii)  cessation or substantial reduction of necessary services.If one or more of these grounds are established, the parties must thenshow, under the concluding part of the provision, that the resultingdetriment to consumers of the goods in question would outweigh anydetriment (whether by the restriction of competition or otherwise)resulting from the continuance of resale price maintenance in respectof those goods.Special exemptions15.      I am convinced that we must stand firm against special treatment for any class of goods, such as has been suggested books and tobacco.We have decided as a matter of policy that exceptions should be dealtwith by a judicial tribunal.    It would be quite wrong and unfair to othersfor Parliament then to take the decision out of the Court&apos;s hands in oneor two favoured cases.    Politically also I believe that a firm stand is best.   v.&quot;e would make some friends over books and tobacco but we shouldmake more enemies among those, e. g. the chemists, who would consider their case is at least as good as that of books and tobacco.Conclusion^16.      I believe that the Bill carries out the intention of the Governmentcontained in my statement of 15th January.    At the same time the grounds for exemption provide a fair and just basis for applicants to plead their case before the Court.E.H,&apos;Board of Trade, S. W. 1.19th February, 1964
