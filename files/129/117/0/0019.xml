(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMEN&apos;.51C. P. (64)69 COPY NO._10th March. 1964CABINETPOST OFFICESJWmGSJBANK:B.SMOVALFROM LONDON&quot;Memorandum by the Secretary of State  or scotland the Postmaster General has suggested (C. P. (64) 66) thatthe choice of location for the Post Office Savings Bank lies betweenTees-side and Liverpool,   I wish to press strongly for a decision in favour of Glasgow,   Moving the Bank to either of these areassuggested would do something to help decongest London and improveemployment balance in a less fortunate area.   But the location ofthe Bank is entirely within the Governments control and its removalis part of a programme of dispersal of Government offices.   TheGovernment cannot, therefore, escape the obligation to try to secure a balanced distribution of this programme between one region andanother.2.       The case on regional development grounds for locating this project in Scotland seems to me to be particularly strong for thefollowing reasons:-(a) Central Scotland has ever since the war had a consistentlyhigher rate of unemployment than any other comparableregion of Great Britain,   (Only in recent yeax*s has theNorth East of England matched the Scottish figures.)(b) Emigration of young people from Scotland is a criticalproblem.   It is proportionately very much higher than fromthe North East and is accelerating.   It has risen from25, 000 in 1955 to over 35, 000 last year,(c) The products of the Scottish educational system are stillgood, but more and more of them are having to seekemployment elsewhere. This is particularly true ofCivil Service employment.(d) The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance provide employment for more than 8,000 people in Newcastle,and the savings certificate division of the G. P. O. bytheir recent move to Durham will provide about 2,200Government office jobs ixi the North East of England.The North West of England has also benefited from theGovernment office dispersal programme.   But no unit of Government administration has been settled inScotland since the move of about 50 Scottish Office civilservants from London to Edinburgh in 1935,-1-
(e) Glasgow is the centre o  a very wide labour catchment areawith a total population of 2 million and a very wide range of schools of the grammar school type, which produce verylarge numbers of qualified young people who would be idealmaterial for the Post Office Savings Bank with a totallong term employment of about 6, 500.   The lack of opportunities for the better qualified school leavers isthe main reason why from the Glasgow area in particularso many of our best young people are migrating in such large numbers to England.3.      In his paper the Postmaster General refers to the declaredpreference of the junior staff (as represented by the Savings Bankbranch of the Civil Service Clerical Association) for Tees-side.This is important but cannot be conclusive.   I understand that lessthan l.j 000 of the total complement of 6, 500 will in fact be requiredto move (the remainder being absorbed elsewhere in the greater london area.) and that the others will be recruited locally.   We must,therefore, I suggest, look to the long term effect&apos; of the move on the economy of, and employment in, the area of final choice.   For thereasons I have given, I am myself convinced that the Glasgow area has very strong claims indeed on this account.4.      The local authorities on Clyde side and the New Towns roundGlasgow are prepared to pool all their resources to meet the housing,education and other requirements of this project and of the transferredstaff.   They feel that in relation to the magnitude of their problems,on the one hand - unemployment, a high rate of emigration and anunbalanced industrial economy - and to the range of facilities and amenities they can off^r, on the other, there is almost an unassailablecase for this major move being accommodated in Glasgow.   Iparticularly agree with these authorities in thsir feeling that, if a project of this sort with a very high local recruitment componentcannot come to Scotland, there is very little prospect of Scotlandever being at the receiving end in the overall plan for dispersal ofGovernment office employment.  A decision in favour of Tees-side,following the establishment of the Ministry of Pensions and national insurance at Newcastle and the savings certificate division atDurham, will tend to be regarded as final proof that these movesstop on the south side of the Border.Mi A.
