secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY?S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1964 h&apos;.\r. ?\cv.&apos;hv?4:u\ -CP. (64) 56 Copy No.   5 J24th February, 1964 - --&quot; vji. -t.CABINETRATESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretaryto the Treasury and Paymaster general we submit this memorandum at the request of the Prime Minister, who had asked us to prepare a short straightforward statement to be made in the very near future to the effect that we have decided in principle to lift some of the loadoff ratepayers and that we are only awaiting the reports of the Allen Committeeon the Impact of Rates, and of the general review of central and local government financial relationships, before deciding the amount.2. We start from the basis that it is not now physically possible to affect thelevel of rate demands which will be sent out in England and Wales in April. Thelevel has already been decided by many Authorities and publicly announced bysome. Legislation would be needed to effect a change. Even if it were made retrospective, which would be objectionable on many grounds, it could at best onlyenable Local Authorities to abate their rate demands for the second half of thefinancial year, that is to say the demands sent out at the beginning of October.3. Relief given very quickly in this way could only be given across the board,that is to say, by a general transfer of the burden from local to national taxation.To have any appreciable effect such across the board relief would have to be very substantial. For example a transfer of  100 million a year in this way would onlyreduce the average annual demand per household at present  30 a year by  3a year.  100 million a year is equivalent to 4d. on the standard rate of Income Tax,with corresponding increases in the lower rates.4. All the evidence that we have points to the conclusion not that the generalburden of rates is too high but that the real trouble derives from a certain limited number of areas, coupled to a general long-term fear of continuing futureincreases. To deal effectively with both these aspects of the matter we need thereport of the committees. We have already taken emergency action to deal withthe hardest cases through the Minister of Housing&apos;s Bill which is now through the commons. This has been defended on the basis that it would deal on a short-term basis with the immediate cases of hardship. To make a general announcementnow in advance of the report of the committees would involve a reversal of attitude which might be difficult to explain. Politically this might produce moredisadvantage than advantage.5. It will be clear that we do not think that an announcement promisingrelief could be financially or politically advantageous. Our advice is that it wouldbe better to explain what we have done by way of interim relief, and to stand firm on a statement that we propose to await the reports of the work that is inhand before determining what changes should be made. While it is true that the ratio of rates to taxes has risen during the last decade, it is still less than it was before the war; and we do not believe that a case on merits has been made out.3980
r-Aj&amp;yjWas --truth ^of course, that the very rapid increase in local authority expenditure-and particularly on education has got to be paid for. It is by nomeans clear that a switch from rates to taxes would on balance reduce hardship to individuals and have a favourable impact on the national economy. We have seen no serious argument to suggest that it would.7. If our colleagues feel it is essential that an announcement of the kind proposed by the Prime Minister should be made, we would make it clear that inour view this must be accompanied by an equally clear and unequivocal statement that an amount equal to that transferred would have to be raised immediately byadditional taxation which would almost certainly have to be direct taxation.R. M.J. A. B.-C.24th February, 1964.
