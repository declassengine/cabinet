^confidential:WAGE-RELATED -BENEFITS AND OTHER MEASURES&apos;TO!,DEAL1&apos;WITH&apos; REDUNDANCYMemorandum i by the Minister of i labour I was invited to submit a further memorandum on the introduction of wage-related benefits in the context of the other measures designed: to reduce the impact of redundancy on individual workmen (CM. (64) 24th Conclusions,Minute ;4.)2. The Economic Case. Our policy for economic growth demands muchmore efficient use of our manpower resources, including the greater mobility oflabour required by more: rapid industrial and technological change. The existingwaste and inefficiencies in the use of labour-some of which are due to. restrictive practices imposed by trade unions and workers mean that we face- shortages oflabour earlier than we need as the economy expands; our labour costs areunnecessarily high; capital equipment is used less productively than, it should be;and there are artificial pressures which generate wage inflation.3. We cannot measure exactly the extent to which labour is misused, butthere have been examples in recent months which suggest that there is inefficiencyin many firms and industries as a result of overmanning, demarcation and otherwasteful practices. Restrictive labour practices are notorious in printing,shipbuilding and the docks, but the difficulties are not confined to these industries. a striking recent case which has come to my notice is the Steel Company of Waleswhose management told me that they certainly employed between 2,000 and 3,000too many workers out of a total of 17,000 and that the figure might be a gooddeal higher.4. We should make the more efficient use of our manpower and the removalof restrictive labour practices key issues in our future economic policies. We canonly only do this successfully if we take effective and imaginative measures, to minimise the hardships of redundancy and redeployment of labour which will be unavoidable.5.   Steps to Increase Retraining and Mobility of Labour(1) We are increasing the capacity of retraining in the Government TrainingCentres and by the end of this year we shall be able to train more than10,000 workers annually. Most of the increase is in Scotland, Wales andthe North of England where the problem of redundancy from the maindeclining older industries is most serious.(2) Allowances to trainees in Government Training Centres have been increased twice since September 1962. The effect has been to increasethe single man&apos;s rate by 45 per cent ( 5 to  8) and the rate for the married man with two children by 25 per cent ( 8 to  10).(3) Under the Resettlement Transfer Scheme, Lodging Allowances are payable for up to two years to relevant workers with dependants who transfer to work away from home. The allowances were raised in September1962 from 35s. to 42s.: per week and a further increase is underconsideration. Improvements are also contemplated in some Of the other facilities of the Scheme which include (a) free fares for the worker andhis dependants to the new area; (b) approved cost of householdremoval; (c) a grant of  10 towards incidental expenses of removal;(d) half the cost of fees in connection with the buying and/or selling ofa house (subject to a maximum grant of  50)/.Printed for the Cabinet.

(4) The more important Industrial Training Boards will start work very soon.The Boards will have power under the Industrial Training Act toprovide for the retraining of adults already in employment, and thosein expanding industries will have both the opportunity and the incentive to step up such training. I shall press them to give attention to this assoon as practical.6, These measures are important, but our policies for dealing with redundancywill be incomplete until we make provision to reduce the financial hardships whichthreaten redundant workers by introducing a measure of wage-related unemployment benefit and a national scheme for severance payments to long-service,workers. Until we do this we shall not reduce the fear of redundancy and the resistance to change which are major obstacles to economic growth because theyprevent the efficient use of manpower and restrict the mobility of labour.7. Wage-Related Unemployment Benefit. The economic arguments for wage-related benefit apply only to unemployment benefit and I would not press oneconomic grounds for the principle to be extended to sickness. Subject to this qualification, I support the general basis of wage relation suggested in CP. (64) 83,paragraph 11. In working out the details, I think we should, so far as practicable,exclude those whose unemployment does not entail significant financial hardship,e.g., workers on short time or unemployed for less than a week. As our purpose isto alleviate the effects of transitional unemployment, I would also limit payment toa maximum period of three months. A scheme on the basis suggested in thememorandum by the Chancellor and with these limitations would, I hope, meetmany of the objections of Treasury Ministers (CP. (64) 83, paragraph 17). the wage-related supplement would not be payable on many of the 3\ million claims for unemployment benefit. I estimate that probably a half-million women workers would not be entitled to a wage-related supplement because their average earnings are not above  9; another 600,000 or so workers would probably not qualify becausethey are disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for various reasons; afurther large number, which could be three-quarters of a million or so, would be excluded either because they are unemployed for less than a week or are on short time. I do not think the increased benefit would be enough to reduce the desire of most unemployed workers to find a new job, particularly if the period for whichthe wage-related supplement is paid is limited to three months; in any case, thereare sanctions which can be taken under the present scheme against the work-shy.I am sure that the cost of wage-related unemployment benefit on these lines, whichwould be  19 million a year spread over the whole employment field, would be fully justified on economic grounds. I know that this view is shared by many employersand that a scheme on these lines is likely to be acceptable to the British Employers&apos;Confederation. It is significant that many large firms now have redundancy policiesunder which they make up unemployment benefit to two-thirds of earnings. They-are prepared to carry the financial burden of providing what is, in effect, wage-related unemployment pay, because they are satisfied it helps them to apply efficient labourpolicies.8. Severance Pay. My proposals for a national severance payments scheme are outlined in CP. (63) 169. The cost would be between  5 and  8 million a year.In my view, severance pay is a necessary complement to wage-related benefit. It isa justifiable reward for long service and compensates for the disturbance, uncertainty and financial loss which usually results when a long-service worker is maderedundant. Even if he goes straight to another job, he often starts at a lower wage and loses other advantages which go with long service (sick pay, pension rights,security). Moreover, the increase in benefit, through the wage-related elementsuggested, is limited and many redundant workers will still suffer a heavy drop in income if they are unemployed.9. Conclusion. The introduction of wage-related benefit and severance payon the modest scales suggested would be valuable additional steps in developing a comprehensive redundancy policy. This would materially assist in providing aclimate in which we could press industry to tackle some of the problems in the labourfield which at present inhibit economic growth and retard the modernisation ofindustry. It would be a definite contribution to encouraging more efficient management of labour and it would help to promote a new approach in dealing withrestrictive labour practices.J.
