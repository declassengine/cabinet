af.X64jJJ  COPY NO.19th February, 1964&quot;CABINETPAY CLAIM FOR .POSTM3S.N AND POSTMSN^HIGHER GRADE.Mernjsrju^um^^The Cabinet authorised me on the 13th February, 1964,(CM. (64) 11th Conclusions, Minute 6) to offer the Union of Post office workers a 3-year pay agreement for postmen and postmen higher gradebased on three annual increases of 4 per cent, 3j per cent and 3j percent respectively.2.       This offer was made to the Union.    Yesterday I received the Union1  executive to hear their reply.    They rejected the 4 per cent offer forpostmen, but made it clear that they would recommend for acceptance totheir special conference, starting on Monday next, an agreement asfollows: -1964      1965       1966Postmen and Postmen Higher Grade 570 3j%        3j/o(115,000)Other Grades 3^&apos;yo        3j%        3j%(60,000)3.       The Union made it very clear that they were not prepared torecommend any figure lower than 5 per cent for postmen in the first year.If we cannot offer 5 per cent we shall be faced with industrial action whichwill seriously affect the postal services.4,      Five per cent for the postmen grades in the first year would mean that the average increase in that year for all those grades represented bythe Union not covered by the central settlement for the non-industrial civil service would be 4j per cent.   But for the whole three year period theaverage increase would be only 3f per cent;  and I think it could berepresented that such an average is not incompatible with the governments incomes policy.5.      Hitherto the Union&apos;s claim for postmen has been unspecified.    we now know for the first time the level at which they are prepared torecommend a settlement.    A settlement would not only avert industrialtrouble in the Post Office, but it could also provide the foundation for improving Post Office relations with the Union over a broad field.6.      I strongly recommend that we should agree to my making an offer to the Union on the basis indicated in paragraph 2.    If a further offer isto be made I am sure that it should be  made now and not v/hen industrial action is officially threatened.J. R. B.General Post Office, S.
