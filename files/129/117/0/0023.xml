This is now attached at Annex A.   at annex B I attach a possible supplementary question and answerdealing with the position of restrictive practices of trade unions inrelation to the enquiry.J.G.Ministry of Labour, S. W. 116th March, 1964
165. ANNEX ADRAFT STATEMENT ON TRADE unions and THE LAWThe law relating to trade unions and employers&apos; associationswas last reviewed nearly sixty years ago.   During this time thetrade union movement has developed beyond recognition andundoubtedly has a vital part to play in the social and economic life of the nation.Recent decisions in the Courts have focused attention on thepresent state of the law affecting trade unions and employers&apos;associations,   I understand that the Trades Union Congress are themselves concerned about the present state of the law and areat present giving consideration to the effect of the recent judgments.The Government are of the opinion that the law should again be reviewed.   Such a review will be most effective if undertaken withthe willing co-operation of both employers&apos; associations and tradeunions and free from the atmosphere of political controversy.The Government propose to seek such co-operation and thinkit advisable that such an enquiry should be undertaken early in the life of the next Parliament.   At the appropriate time they will discuss with the Trades Union Congress and the British Employers&apos;Confederation and others concerned both the form and scope of theenquiry.
ANNEX possible SUPPLEMENTARY question and ANSWERQ.      Would the restrictive practices of trade unions be covered by this review?A.      As I have said, we shall discuss the scope of the proposedreview with the Trades Union Congress and the british employers&apos; Confederation,,   What is clearly necessary isa comprohtenaive   review of the law relating to trade unions and employers&apos; associations, but questions of law and practice are bound to overlap and I think the review wouldhave to take account of the role and policies of trade unions and employers&apos; associations in our present society.
