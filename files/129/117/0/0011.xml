IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot;S government cp. (64) 614th March, 1964CABINETRATESNote, by the  Prime MinisterFollowing our discussion last Thursday (CM. (64) 15thConclusions, Minute 7) the Home Secretary and the Chief Secretaryhave prepared a further draft of what might be said.    This isattached.    I should like to discuss this at tomorrow&apos;s Cabinet,A. D, -PI.COPY NO.10 Downing Street, S. W. 1.4th March, 1964
The Government fully understand the apprehensions which many people feel about Rates.    Although these still take a smaller proportion of our gross national product than they did before theWar, and although they have risen a great deal less than nationaltaxation, they have nonetheless risen substantially in the last fewyears.    And many people fear that future increases in spending byLocal Authorities may cause Rates to go on rising.The Government have already taken steps to deal with the worst cases of hardship.    These are confined to a limited numberof people in a limited number of areas.    But with re-valuationsome of these have had very sharp increases in Rates.    In orderto deal with these cases as a matter of urgency we introduced the rating (Interim Relief) Bill which is now before Parliament.    Thiswill enable very early help to be given, in the most difficultindividual cases.The problem hov/ever goes much deeper than this.   For that reason last Autumn the Government set in hand a review of thewhole relationship between central and local government spending.The object is to make   sure that the shares borne by the taxpayeras such and the ratepayer as such (for most of us are both) arefair, and that the rating system works properly.The biggest single cause of increase in Rates is of course the tremendous expansion of our educational system.    Everyonebelieves this is right - but it has to be paid for.    One of the things which we intend to look at in the course of the review of the relation-ship between central and local government finance is as to whether some further part of the cost of education ought to be paid for out of taxes rather than out of rates.    We shall also be considering aspart of the work v/e are doing in the light of the Robbins Report on higher Education whether responsibility for some parts of the educational system, such as teacher training colleges, ought to betransferred from the responsibility of local government to that of central government.We also appointed last summer a committee under ProfessorAllen to go into the question of the human aspect of Rates, that is tosay into the question of the extent to which they cause hardship.This Committee has taken a great deal of evidence, and we are looking forward to getting its report in the Summer.So we have already taken action to deal immediately with thehardest cases;  we are undertaking a thorough review of the relativeburdens of taxpayer and ratepayer;  and undertaking a detailedenquiry into the possibility of hardship.CONFSDENTIAL
