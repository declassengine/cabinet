- , confidential V -(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CP. (64) 72 COPY NO.        113th March, 1964CABINETEX TENSION. OF DIVORCE JURISDICTIONTOjmg COUNTY COURTSMemorandum by the Lord chancellor apologise for troubling my colleagues again on this subjectbut I am in difficulties.    Last November the Permanent Secretary ofmy office when questioned by the Public Accounts Committee aboutpossible savings in the mounting cost of legal aid, disclosed that oneof the matters under consideration was the possibility of transferringto the County Court jurisdiction to try undefended divorce cases.This attracted some publicity and I am now being pressed to say whatis the conclusion arrived at.    Mr. Abse has tabled a question on this in the Commons and Lord Silkin has tabled an unstarred question(which in the House of Lords means that there will be a debate)asking if Her Majesty&apos;s Government are able to make a statement onthe prospect of extending the jurisdiction of the County Court todivorce proceedings.2. This debate will take place on 23rd March.    My difficulty isto know what to say.    To refrain  from announcing any decision on amatter which it was announced last November was under consideration and when the arguments pro and con are so well known will be difficult,and I feel that failure to do so will be regarded as a sign of ineptitudeand incompetence.3. On the other hand, the announcement of a decision is bound,whatever the decision is, to give rise to controversy.    If we were to announce that we had decided not to transfer such jurisdiction, weshould be open to attack.    It would be said that there was a good case for the transfer on the merits and that the Governments lack of concern about expenditure of public money was shown by their failure to make a change which was well justified and would lead to a saving of, it is estimated, at least  300, 000 a year.    Such a change wouldbe strongly supported by the Law Society and my efforts to secureeconomies in the legal aid system which they administer would be weakened by failure to take a course which would bring such asubstantial saving and which they advocate.4. On the other hand an announcement that the Government werein favour of transferring to the County Court Judges jurisdiction to doin the County Courts what they do now as Commissioners of the HighCourt would arouse strong opposition from the Bar and from those who take the view expressed by the Gorell Commission in 1912 which said --1-
&quot;... the gravity of divorce and other matrimonial cases,affecting as they do the family life, the status of theparties, the interests of their children, and the interestof the State in the moral and social well-being of itscitizens, makes it desirable to provide, if possible,that, even for the poorest persons, these cases shouldbe determined by the superior courts of the countryassisted by the attendance of the Bar, which we regard as of high importance in divorce and matrimonial cases,both in the interests of the parties and in the publicinterest. &quot;and by the Denning Committee in 1946 which said -&quot;If there is a careful and dignified proceeding such asobtains in the High Co\irt for the undoing of a marriage,then quite unconsciously the people will have a muchmore respectful view of the marriage tie and of the marriage status than they would if divorce were affected informally in an inferior court. &quot;These views were endorsed by the Morton Commission on Divorcein 1956.5. Personally I doubt whether the form of divorce proceedingsleads to people having a much more respectful view of the marriagetie, and I do not accept the view that divorce would be effectedinformally in the County Court.6. I have had a talk on this with the Archbishop of Canterbury,He told me initially that he did not think that the transfer of jurisdiction would give rise to hostility in the Church but that hewould take soundings.    He has now written to me to say that he believes there would be considerable adverse feeling, broadly onthe grounds mentioned in paragraph 4.7. On 23rd March, I would much prefer to announce a decision^either not to transfer jurisdiction or to do so.    If I do not announce a decision, the pressure to do so will continue and sooner or later i fear we will be compelled to announce one.My personal view is that we should grasp the nettle.    i will not repeat the arguments in my paper C. P. (64) 38 but I dobelieve that when it is explained that County Court Judges will notbe asked to do anything they do not do now, that all divorce cases will start in the High Court and the High Court will retain controlover them, it should be possible to allay the fears of the opponentsto this change.D.Lord Chancellor&apos;s Office,House of Lords, S. W. 1.13th March, 1964-2-
