ANNUAL   REVIEW  AND   DETERMINATION  of guarantees, 1964I. Developments in Agricultural policy. The 1964 Annual Review of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry has been held in accordance with the agriculture act, 1947, and against the background of the statement in the 1963 annual review White Paper (Cmnd. 1968) that further changes would be necessaryin the development of the Governmenfs agricultural policy. The Ministerof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food explained in his speech in the Houseof Commons on 22nd May last the lines along which it was intended todevelop agricultural policy, and the particular need for action in regardto cereals and fatstock, which in recent years have accounted for the major part of the cost of Exchequer support for commodities guaranteedunder the Agriculture Acts.2. At recent Reviews the determination of the guarantees has been influenced by the rising level and unpredictability of Exchequer costarising from instability in market prices. This in turn has been due tothe pressure on our market of total supplies, including imports, and alsoto the fact that, in general, with imports unregulated, it is more difficultto improve the phasing and marketing of home supplies. Accordingly,the Government envisaged for cereals and fatstock a system of controlof imports or import prices combined with the extension at home of thestandard quantity concept into these commodities.3. In formulating such arrangements, the Governments aim has been to secure a greater degree of stability in the market. The intention isnot to raise market prices generally by restricting supplies but to ensurethat the support system is not undermined by excessively low market prices leading to heavy demands on the Exchequer. The system of support through deficiency payments suits us as a nation and is of great benefit to consumers as well as producers. By safeguarding it from unduepressures in this way, the Government are maintaining the system withits advantages to the community.4. The Governmenfs objective has also been to maintain a fair and reasonable balance between home production and imports, starting frombroadly the present proportions of our market which are supplied from home production and imports. As regards the growth in the market which can be expected on account of the increase in population and therise in living standards, it would provide for domestic producers and overseas suppliers the opportunity of sharing in this in a fair and reasonable way. Apart from adjustments due to the natural growth ofthe market, the Government will in any case wish to review from timeto time the balance between home production and imports in the lightof supply and marketing conditions, including changes in the relativeefficiency of suppliers and in consumer demand. In this way, Britishfarmers will have the opportunity of securing an increasing outlet in a growing home market.5. The proposals which the Government formulated in pursuance oftheir policy have been discussed over recent months with the leaders of
the agricultural industry, the representatives of the trade interests con-cerned, and Commonwealth and other overseas suppliers. The first resultof these discussions was the understanding reached in the autumn of1963 with the principal overseas suppliers of bacon for the sharing ofthe United Kingdom market. In consequence of this understanding,exporters of bacon will regulate their supplies to the United kingdom market from 1st April, 1964. The domestic production of pigmeat is subject to regulation by the existing flexible guarantee arrangementsintroduced at the 1961 Annual Review.6. For cereals also, agreement in principle has been reached with our principal overseas suppliers on minimum import price arrangements whichwill secure that cereals, cereal products and by-products are not importedbelow certain minimum import prices. Our other suppliers also are beinginformed of the proposed arrangements. Subject to completion of thenecessary legislative processes in the United Kingdom and to final agreementwith our principal overseas suppliers, regulation of import prices will bebrought into operation in time for the cereal year 1964/65.7. It has been determined in this Review that (subject to the introductionof the minimum import price system) standard quantities will be introduced for wheat and barley as the counterpart to the regulation of import prices. The standard quantities (which will reflect &quot; such part of thenation&apos;s food and other agricultural produce as in the national interestit is desirable to produce in the United Kingdom &quot;f) will be determined at each Annual Review taking account of the growth of the demand for cereals for human consumption and animal feed and any changes necessary as a result of reviewing the balance between home production and imports.The determination of the standard quantities for cereals for the cerealyear 1964/65 is based upon an assessment of the current level ofproduction and is related to the total requirement of cereals in the UnitedKingdom at the present time after making reasonable allowance for imports.Over a number of years, the total requirement has shown a significantgrowth. Whilst it is not possible accurately to prejudge what future requirements will be, the prospects are that demand for cereals will continueto increase. As has been stated, the Government intend to provide Britishfarmers, and also overseas suppliers, with the opportunity of securing a fair share in the growth of the market. The Government intend to increase the levels of the standard quantities as required to provide this opportunity for home producers in the future.8. For meat, it has not been possible to reach agreement with our overseas suppliers on the Government^ proposals for voluntary restriction of exportsto this market, which would have been coupled with standard quantityarrangements for fatstock at home. These cannot therefore be introduced forthe coming fatstock year. The Government will however continue their efforts to secure comprehensive and satisfactory arrangements on these finesand will participate in the work of the G.A.T.T. Meat Group. Meanwhile,the Government are seeking the co-operation of our overseas suppliers inco-ordinating the level and phasing of supplies to the United Kingdom market in the interest of maintaining market stability in the coming months.9. The Government expect to see arrangements for cereals and fatstocksubsumed in any more comprehensive international arrangements which may* Section 1 of the Agriculture Act, 1947.
result from the commodity discussions in connection with the kennedy round. In accordance with their strong support for the negotiations for the kennedy Round in the G.A.T.T., the Government will continue to work forthe successful conclusion of international commodity agreements with theobject of maintaining and expanding world trade and improving the organisa-tion of the world market in a manner fair alike to producers and consumers.10. The Government attach great importance to the efficient marketing ofhome produced cereals and fatstock and will work for improvements in thepresent arrangements. The achievement of greater stability in the market forthese commodities, both as regards imports and through the changes in theguarantee arrangements for these commodities following this Annual Review,will make it possible to tackle the problem of improving the phasing and marketing of the home product at both the national level and the level of theindividual producer. For cereals, the Government are already exploring inconjunction with producers&apos; representatives and other interests, ways of giving effect to these objectives. The Report of the Verdon-Smith Committee on the marketing of Fatstock (Cmnd. 2282) is now being examined in consulta-tion with representatives of producers and other interests and the Govern-ment will make known their views on the recommendations in the report as soon as possible.11. The Governmenfs purpose in working out new arrangements in regardto imports and in adapting the existing system of support has been, and willcontinue to be, to provide for effective implementation of the principles of the agriculture Acts of 1947 and 1957 and thus to ensure the ability of theagricultural industry to develop its prosperity. In this respect they will haveregard to the economic and social importance of British agriculture and tothe special nature of the industry. These considerations were recognised in the agriculture Act, 1947, and in the White Paper on Agriculture (Cmnd. 1249)of December, 1960.* In the light of these objectives and considerations itwill be the Governmenfs intention, subject to consideration of all the relevant factors at each Annual Review, to make such determinations as will advancethese objectives and provide the opportunity for agricultural producers to share in the growing prosperity of the community generally.12. The Governmenfs intention is that arrangements for import controland for standard quantities should be effective in relating home and over-seas supplies to the needs of the market and in ensuring a proper balance between home production and imports. On the assumption that these objec-tives are achieved the Government will be able, in determining the basicguaranteed prices at Annual Reviews, to give greater weight to the level of farmers&apos; returns than would have been possible in the absence of such arrangements.* Section 1 of the Agriculture Act, 1947, defines as the purpose of the Act the promotionand maintenance of &quot; a stable and efficient agricultural industry capable of producing such part of the nation&apos;s food and other agricultural produce as in the national interest it is desirableto produce in the United Kingdom, and of producing it at minimum prices consistently with proper remuneration and living conditions for farmers and workers in agriculture and anadequate return on capital invested in the industry &quot;.The White Paper on Agriculture of December, 1960, referred to the agreement betweenthe Government and the Farmers&apos; Unions that &quot; as the industry strengthens its competitive power and so advances towards its declared objective of reducing Exchequer support to theminimum practicable amount, it is right and proper that it should have the incentive andreward of an increase in its living standards &quot;.7
II. Economic Condition of: the Agricultural industry the Course of Production13. The exceptionally harsh winter of 1962/63 brought about some checkto the continuing upward trend in agricultural output. Lambing and litterrates suffered, the normal calving pattern was upset, and milk output waslower. Arable crop yields were also affected. Agricultural net output in1963/64 may therefore increase at a slower rate than in the previous year, andthe index of net output (average of 1954/55 to 1956/57= 100) is forecast at127 for the year ending 31st May, 1964, compared with a revised figure of 125for 1962/63 and 117 for 1961/62 (Appendix I, Table K, page 27).Changes in Income14. Actual net income for the year ending 31st May, 1964, is forecast at 406^ million compared with the revised estimate for 1962/63 of  445^million. The drop in actual net income is largely the result of the abnormalweather conditions. When adjusted to normal weather conditions the forecast for 1963/64 is  429^ million compared with the revised estimate of  438million for 1962/63,  420^ million in 1961/62 and  3941 million in1960/61 (Appendix II, Table A, page 28).Costs and Efficiency15. The prices of goods and services used in agriculture have in generalcontinued to rise. The main item is an increase in the cost of labourbut there have also been substantial increases in feedingstuffs and rents.There have been significant reductions in the prices of fertilisers and inmachinery expenses. The net increase to be taken into account at this review is about  24 million for Review commodities (Appendix III,page 32). Against this rise in costs there is the gain to the industry fromthe continuing improvement in efficiency. As in previous years the figureof  25 million is taken as an indication of the probable rise on this account in the income of the industry.Cost of Agricultural Support16. The Exchequer cost in 1961/62 was at the high level of  343million. In 1962/63 it fell to  310 million and in 1963/64 it is expectedto be  301 million. The reduction in expenditure over this period wasthe result in the main of a strengthening of market prices. The chiefcauses of the large saving on the Estimates for 1963/64 were the excep-tional weather at home and the strength of world markets as a resultof shortages in Western Europe and crop failures in Eastern Europe,Russia and China. The Estimates presented to Parliament for the coming year (which do not take into account the determinations made at this review) amount to  320 million.*III. Determination of GuaranteesCereals17. In 1963 the total acreage of cereals reached 8 million acres forthe first time since de-control, and the estimated cost of Exchequer support in the financial year 1964/65 is  72 million, compared with about  77million in 1963/64, and  64 million in 1962/63.* The net effect of the Review determinations on the Estimates is shown in Appendix V,Table A, note (viii), page 36.
18. As stated in paragraphs 6 and 7, the Government intend to introduceby 1st July, 1964 minimum import prices for imported cereals. There willalso be new guarantee arrangements for wheat and barley incorporatingstandard quantities and target indicator prices.19. In 1963/64 it is estimated that production of wheat and barleywill be 9-6 million tons. For 1964/65 the standard quantities will be-3 million tons for wheat and 6-5 million tons for barley, together totalling9-8 million tons. If production exceeds these levels, subsidy will be calcu-lated only on the standard quantity figures so reducing the deficiencypayment per ton in proportion to the excess. Standard quantities for future years will be determined at the appropriate Annual Review with due allowance for future growth of the market as explained in paragraph 7. (the separate standard quantities for wheat and barley will be adjusted asbetween each other in any year when the wheat acreage is exceptionallylow.)20. The target indicator prices for 1964/65 will be 20s. Od. per cwt.for wheat, and 19s. Od. per cwt. for barley. These have been fixed inrelation to the proposed minimum import prices for the appropriate grainsafter allowing for the recognised handling differentials, quality differences,and present marketing conditions. They will be reviewed at each annual review.21. The target indicator prices will have two different purposes. Whereproduction is above the standard quantity (or is within a range below thestandard quantity of 3-2 to 3-3 million tons for wheat, and of 6-3 to6-5 million tons for barley) and market prices are weak so that they donot reach the target level, they will limit the rate of the deficiency payment.Where production is below the standard quantity, and market prices arestrong, they will be used so as to increase the deficiency payment on thelower quantity.22. Details as to how the standard quantity and target indicator pricemechanisms will operate, are given in Part II of Appendix VI, pages 42and 43.23. The minimum import prices will prevent unduly low priced importsfrom undermining the market. The new guarantee arrangements will alsobring the cost of the support system under better control, while main-taining the advantages of the present system and providing producers withopportunities for sharing in the growth of the market.24. The new guarantee arrangements will not apply to oats and rye.For 1964/65 the guaranteed prices for all cereals will be unchanged.Milk25. Over the three years from 1958/59 to 1961/62 milk output increasedby an average of 110 million gallons a year while the consumption of liquid milk increased on average by only 22 million gallons a year. Much thegreater part of the extra milk produced therefore had to be sold at low prices by the Milk Marketing Boards for manufacture. As a result theaverage price paid to producers (the pool price) fell by 2d. a gallon over these three years (Appendix I, Table B and Figure I, page 16).9
26. At the last Annual Review there were signs that the increase in production and the increase in consumption of liquid milk were cominginto better balance, and the Government accordingly felt able to increasethe guaranteed price by ^d. a gallon. The increase in production in 1962/63proved to be less than expected and production in the current year* isexpected to be lower than last year.27. During this time the dairy herd was beginning to fall. By the endof 1963 it was about 3 per cent, below the level at the end of the pre-vious year, and the fall seems to be continuing. With changes in feedingpractices and more concentration on improving the quality of milk, yieldsare not expected to rise as rapidly as in the past.28. These new circumstances make it possible for the Government tobring about a much-needed improvement in the incomes of milk producers.They have therefore decided to increase the guaranteed price by 2 d. a gallon. Further, as already announced, a  d. will be added to help finance for the time being the Milk Boards&apos; schemes for the improvement ofcompositional quality.29. The standard quantities will in future be adjusted so as to reflectcurrent rather than past changes in the level of liquid consumption. details are given in Appendix VI, Part II, page 43.Fat Cattle30. There has been some expansion of home production of beef in1963/64 which has been more than offset by a reduction in imported supplies (Appendix I, Table D and Figure II, pages 18 and 19). As tothe future, the beef breeding herd is expanding very slowly and thereduction in the dairy herd reduces the contribution to beef supplies from this source. Demand on the other hand is strong and appearslikely to remain so. The Government consider that some furtherstimulus should be given to maintain supplies from the home producer.The guaranteed price is therefore being raised by 3s. Od. per live cwt.and the rate of calf subsidy will be increased by 10s. Od. a head inrespect of steer calves born on or after 1st January, 1964. The CalfSubsidy Scheme, which expires in October, 1964, will be continued for afurther 3 years.Fat Sheep and Wool31. The expansion of the breeding flock was checked in 1963 by the severe winter, and home production of mutton and lamb in 1963/64will be broadly the same as in 1962/63. There has been some decline in imports (Appendix I, Table D and Figure II, pages 18 and 20). market prices in 1963/64 have been consistently better than in 1962 and 1961.Assuming a normal lambing rate in 1964, home production in the coming year is expected to show a substantial increase. No change will be madein the guaranteed price for fat sheep but an increase of 2d. a lb. will bemade in the guaranteed price of wool.Fat Pigs32. To promote stability in production the Government introduced in1961 the flexible guarantee arrangements under which the guaranteed* The year ending 31st May, 1964.10
price is automatically reduced if production rises above a middle bandand increased if it falls below. It is therefore important that the middleband should be set at the level which will reflect the quantities of pigmeatwhich the market can absorb at reasonable prices.33. The middle band is at present set at 10^-11 million pigs. Market-ings of pigs qualifying for the guarantee in 1963/64 have been running at about llf million. Prices were low at the beginning of the fatstockyear but the market for all pigs has been strong since last summer.34. In view of the strength of the market for pork, and the amount ofbacon which the United Kingdom is to supply under the bacon marketsharing understanding, the Government believe that the middle band shouldbe raised this year to llf-llf million pigs in order to reflect the continuinglevel of demand for pigmeat.35. But stability in production must not be jeopardised. The breedingherd has now been kept at a steady level for about 18 months and theGovernment are most anxious that this stability should not be upset.36. The effect of raising the middle band by f million pigs would be toincrease the present price to producers by Is. 9d. per score. In theGovernments view such an increase would endanger the stability of produc-tion. They are therefore reducing the guaranteed price by 6d. per score,leaving producers with a net improvement of Is. 3d. per score on theirpresent price.Eggs37. Production in 1963/64 will be higher than 1962/63 because theaverage size of the laying flock has increased and egg yields are higher.There has been a large increase in the population of young replacementbirds. The higher yields and the continuing improvements in methods ofproduction are estimated to be worth annually at least Id. per dozen to theindustry. Home supplies fill nearly the whole of the market (Appendix I,Table E and Figure III, page 21).38. Production in 1964/65 is expected to expand much more rapidly than demand, which is inelastic. This is likely to lead to lower prices and higher subsidy. The Board&apos;s selling price has already fallen sharply andin the coming year as a whole is expected to be substantially below theindicator price introduced at the 1963 Review. There is a clear tendency towards over-production which must be checked. On a falling market theindicator price system will itself reduce producers&apos; prices. On the otherhand the industry will gain from the improvement in production techniques.The Government consider that in all the circumstances the guaranteed priceshould be reduced by Id. per dozen.Potatoes39. The United Kingdom crop acreage has increased by about 30,000acres in each of the last two years and is now 768,000 acres. This isstill somewhat below the acreage which, given normal yields, would meet requirements. The Government have decided to increase the guaranteed price by 5s. Od. a ton.11
Sugar Beet40. In the light of developments in the world sugar situation the contractacreage was reviewed in November, 1963, and the acreage to which theguarantee will apply in 1964 was increased by 20,750 acres to 435,350 acres.The price for the 1964 crop for beet of 16 per cent, sugar content will beincreased by 3s. 4d. a ton. The increase in acreage will be continued for1965.Production Grants41. Lime Subsidy. The Agricultural Lime Subsidy Payments Orderexpires in July, 1964, and on the renewal of this Order for a further period the existing percentage grant system will be replaced by a flat rate subsidycontribution which will bring the arrangements more into line with present day conditions in the lime trade, and lead to greater administrative efficiency and control.42. Fertiliser Subsidy. The hard winter and late spring of 1963 resultedin a temporary check to the continued upward trend in the use of fertilisers.The Exchequer cost fell by  1-6 million to  32-3 million. But with normal weather fertiliser use is expected to increase again and the Exchequer cost atpresent rates of subsidy is forecast to rise in 1964/65 to  35 million. TheGovernment have decided upon a reduction in the rate of subsidy to reducethe total annual subsidy bill by  2 million.43. Hill Cow Subsidy. Schemes will be made providing for the con-tinued payment of hill cow subsidy in 1964 and the three following years.44. Winter Keep and Ploughing Grants. To provide further assist-ance for livestock rearers in hill areas the Government propose to maketwo changes in the Winter Keep Scheme. The rates of grant will beincreased by  1 an acre ; and farmers Will no longer have to choose betweenwinter keep grant and ploughing grant. Subject to the approval of Parliamentthese changes will take effect from the outset of the Scheme and will thereforeapply to crops produced this year for feed over the winter of 1964/65.45. Last year the Government decided that the age at which grasslandqualifies for the higher rate of ploughing grant (i.e.  12 per acre) shouldbe advanced by five years and land is now eligible if it has been undergrass since 1st June, 1951 instead of 1st June, 1946. For the 1964 PloughingGrants Scheme the qualifying date will be 1st June, 1952.Other Measures46. It has been agreed that a study group should be set up, with the farmers&apos; Unions, to consider ways and means of encouraging the applica-tion on the farm of the results of veterinary research. The Farmers&apos; unions have also suggested that more attention should be paid to developments infarm buildings design and they have been invited to put specific suggestions to the Agricultural Advisory Council and the Scottish Agricultural Improve-ment Council.
IV; Changes in the Mechanism of Certain Guarantee ArrangementsCattle and Sheep47. As foreshadowed in the 1963 Annual Review White Paper the weekly standard price system for cattle and sheep will be amended sothat market forces will have a greater influence on producers&apos; marketingdecisions. A graduated deficiency payments scheme will provide an incentive for producers to market their stock when prices are good andto hold off when the market is weak.48. The interests of hill sheep farmers, who have less opportunity to adjust the marketing of their lambs to the state of the market, will be safe-guarded by a special arrangement. This special arrangement will havethe further advantage of giving general encouragement to the marketing of lambs at lighter weights. Details of all these changes are in Part ii of Appendix VI, pages 43 and 44.49. Following last year&apos;s Review the seasonal scales for cattle and sheep were adjusted ; further changes on similar lines will be made with effect from 29th March, 1960. Also the quality differential between Grade Iand Grade II cattle will be discontinued from that date.Pigs50. In the 1963 Annual Review White Paper the Government announced their intention of abolishing the separate stabilisers at this Review but expressed their readiness to consider whether some alternative measure wasnecessary.in the interests of bacon pig producers. In the meantime, theGovernment have undertaken in the bacon market sharing understandingto use their best endeavours to keep the production of bacon in the UnitedKingdom at the levels allocated in accordance with the understanding. TheGovernment will now be examining, in conjunction with the producers andthe trade, whether additional provisions are necessary, either within or outside the pigs guarantee, to influence or regulate the production of baconfor this purpose. Until this examination has been completed, the separatestabilisers will be retained in their present form.51. At the request of the Farmers&apos; Unions there will be consultationwith the. industry as to the practicability of a scheme for encouraging long-term contracts for the supply of pigs both to bacon factories and to otherpurchasers of pigs by deadweight.52. Meanwhile, no change will be made in the quality premiums for1964/65, although the Government still intend that they should be dis-continued over the next year or two.Eggs and Pigs Feed Formula;53. As foreshadowed in the 1963 Annual Review White Paper the feedformula?, which provide automatic adjustments to the guaranteed prices for pigs and eggs in accordance with changes in feed costs, will be modified.The present arrangements were introduced ten years ago and do not takesinto account improvements which have since taken place in the efficiency
of feed conversion. The changes which will be made will correct the presenttendency for the formulae to over-compensate for changes in feed costs.Details are in Part II of Appendix VI, page 45. The operation of theformulae will be reviewed again in two years&apos; time.V.   Effect of Determinations54. The determinations made in the light of this Review will increasethe total value of the guarantees by about  31 million.

Note (ii). These two series of aggregate farming net income are calculated in fundamentally different ways. The &quot; Departmental&quot; estimate is built up from the statistics of income and expenditure for the whole &quot; national&quot; farm, whereas the&quot; raised sample &quot; is based on some 3,700 actual farm accounts, which are expanded or &quot; raised &quot; to give an aggregate for all farms in the United Kingdom. There area number of reasons why the levels of aggregate net income shown in these two series should vary, but it is difficult to make a quantitative assessment of the individualcauses.  Both series are of value in indicating the general trend in the level of income.Note (iii). The figures for aggregate net income in Table A include as profit inrecent years about  8 million on the production of food for consumption in the farmhousehold. In other industries the corresponding sums are not treated as profitand are relatively much smaller (in many cases non-existent).Note (iv). From the figures for aggregate net income in Table A certain sums shouldhave been appropriated by farmers to cover the excess of replacement cost overoriginal cost of certain assets (slaughter stock, cultivations, growing crops, etc.) usedup in the course of the year&apos;s production and trade.These sums are: 				  million		  million1937/38	li	1954/55	18i1946/47     ......	23	1955/56	271947/48     ...      ...	23i	1956/57	301948/49     ......	17	1957/58	iii1949/50     ......	29i	1958/59	211950/51     -......	41i	1959/60	20i1951/52     ......	40	1960/61	27i1952/53      ......	21i	1961/62	25i1953/54      ......	14	1962/63	28		1963/64	27 (forecast)Figure IAggregate Farming Net Income in the United Kingdom: &quot; Departmental&quot; Calculation

Note ((&apos;). The figures for years up to and including 1962/63 represent actual expendi-ture recorded in the Appropriation Accounts. The figures for 1963/64 are the latest estimates (Hansard 11th February, 1964, cols. 45-46) of cash expenditure in theUnited Kingdom (Civil Estimates Class V, votes 3, 4, 5, and 6). The figures for-1964/65 are based on the Civil Estimates now before the House of Commons and. donot take account of the determinations in this White Paper (see however Note viii).Note (//). Payments in respect of cereals, potatoes and wool relate partly to the crops or clip of the year indicated and partly to the crops or clips of the preceding year or years.Note (iii). Figures for milk exclude expenditure on school and welfare milk.Following the 1962 Annual Review the retail price of milk was arranged so that neither a deficiency nor a surplus will arise, taking one year with another, from the implementation of the price guarantee.Note (iv). Expenditure on Tuberculosis Eradication relates to Bonus payments under the Attested Herds Scheme only and excludes compensation payments forslaughtered reactors.Note (v). The item &quot; other grants &quot; includes grants to producers in the ScottishIslands, rabbit clearance societies, improvement of livestock, bracken eradicationand machinery syndicates. .Note (vi). The following are relevant production grants for the purposes of the agriculture Act, 1957, and the Annual Review: Fertilisers subsidy.Lime subsidy.Ploughing grants.Grassland renovation.Winter keep.Field drainage grants for ditching and moling (estimated cost  0-5 million in1963/64; figure in the Table includes expenditure on tiling schemes).Marginal Production Assistance grants.Bonus payments under the Tuberculosis (Attested Herds) Scheme.Calf subsidy.Hill cattle and hill cow subsidies.Silo subsidies.Grants to small farmers.Grants to producers in the Scottish Islands.Grants to rabbit clearance societies.Arrangements for the benefit of agricultural producers in Northern Irelandfinanced from the U.K. Exchequer.Grants for agricultural marketing development (estimated cost in 1963/64 0-06 million).Note (vii). The Table excludes the grants for agricultural marketing development projects mentioned in note (vi) above.  It also excludes grants to horticulturists.Note (viii). On the basis of the original assumptions as to output and market prices the estimated effect of the determinations set out in this White Paper, togetherwith the proposed increase in the retail price of milk, is a net addition of about 7 million to the total estimated cost ( 320 -1 million) of agricultural support by theExchequer in 1964/65. This net addition is the result broadly of increases of  4m.on cattle,  4im. on pigs,   m. on wool, a net increase of  lm. on production grants and a reduction of  3m. on eggs.The figures do not include the effect on deficiency payments of any changes in output during the year which may be ascribed to Review changes nor the effect ofthe standard quantity/target indicator price arrangements for cereals.The net effect of the determinations on the Estimates differs from the effect on thevalue of the guarantees for several reasons; the more important are that the priceguarantee arrangements for some commodities do not involve Exchequer payments and that the payment periods for some items do not correspond with thefinancial year.

Od.Notes on Price Tables(a) The guaranteed prices for fat cattle, fat sheep and wheat are average prices subject tovariation seasonally; the guarantee payments for fat cattle and some fat pigs are subjectto variation according to quality; and the method of calculating the fat pigs guarantee pay-ments involves an element of estimation. Because marketings and prices of fatstock and wheat may vary from those forecast, producers&apos; average returns under the guarantees for those products in any year may differ slightly from the guaranteed prices.(6) The guaranteed price for pigs is subject to the flexible guarantee arrangement described in Part II of this Appendix.(c) The guaranteed price for milk determined for 1964/65 includes the 0-25d. per gallonspecial assistance for compositional quality referred to in paragraph 28 above.id) The guaranteed price for barley is subject to arrangements whereby, to enGOurage amore even spread of marketings over the season, the deficiency payments are subject topremiums for barley delivered, after sale, in the later months of the cereal year and deductionsfor barley delivered in the early months of the year.
Part II.  Additional Details of guarantees. The guaranteed prices shown in Part I of this Appendix for livestock and livestock products in 1964/65 and for crops of the 1964 harvest will be on a similar basis to those for the previous year except as stated in the following paragraphs.Cereals2. Introduction of Standard Quantity/Target Indicator Price Arrangements. Thenew guarantee arrangements based on standard quantity/target indicator pricemechanisms will be introduced for wheat and barley with effect from 1st July, 1964.3. Standard Quantities. The standard quantity for wheat will be 3-3 million tons and that for barley 6-5 million tons. In order to relate production to thestandard quantity, the production of both wheat and barley in any year will be calculated by multiplying the acreage in that year by a 3-year average of yields(weighted by acreage in those years) including the November estimate of the year inquestion. In any year when the wheat acreage is abnormally low a crop adjustmentformula will be used to make a suitable reduction in the wheat standard quantity and a corresponding increase in the barley standard quantity.4. Target Indicator Prices. These prices are related to the proposed minimum import prices for the appropriate grains after allowing for the recognised handlingdifferentials, quality differences and present marketing conditions of the UnitedKingdom crop. For the cereal year 1964/65 the target indicator prices are fixed at20s. Od. per cwt. for wheat and 19s. Od. per cwt. for barley. If a change should bemade in the course of the cereal year in the relevant minimum import prices, an identical change will be made in the target indicator price, and an average targetindicator price for the cereal year would be used throughout the calculations.5. Method of Calculation of Deficiency Payment(a) When production is above the standard quantity, the price deficiency is thedifference between the guaranteed price and either the average market price for the cereal year or the target indicator price, whichever is the higher.Example:(1) (2)Guaranteed price        ............26s. 6d. 26s. 6d.Target indicator price.........      ...   20s. Od. 20s. Od.Average market price............21s. Od. 19s. 6d.Price deficiency ............    5s. 6d. 6s. 6d.The deficiency payment is then arrived at by reducing the price deficiency in proportion to the excess of production over the standard quantity.Example:Production       ..................3-5 million tonsStandard quantity       ...     -............3-3 million tons(1) (2)Deficiency Payment     ...   33 33- of 5s. 6d. = 5s. 2d. -of 6s. 6d. ^ 6s. 2d.35 35(b) When production is within a range of 3 - 2 to 3-3 million tons for wheat or 6 - 3to 6-5 million tons for barley (subject to any adjustments consequent on the cropadjustment formula) and the average market price over the cereal year is below the target indicator price, there will be an escalator arrangement illustrated by the follow-ing example: Example:Guaranteed price        ...      ......      .........    26s. 6d.Target indicator price..................    20s. Od.Average market price..................    19s. 6d.Wheat production Deficiency Payment(million tons)3-3        ..................     6s. 6d.3-25      ...................6s. 9d.,    3-2        ..................     7s. Od.(For production below 3-2 million tons the deficiency payment would also be 7s. Od.i.e. the difference between the guaranteed price and the average market price.)
(c) When production is below the standard quantity and. the average market priceover the cereal year exceeds the target indicator price, 25 per cent, of this excesswill be added to the price deficiency (i.e. guaranteed price less average market price)in arriving at the deficiency paymentExample:Wheat production      ...............    3-1 million tonsGuaranteed price................ 26s. 6d.Average market price  ......      ...      ...      ... 21s. Od.Target indicator price.........      ...... 20s. Od.Price deficiency       =   5s. 6d.Deficiency payment =   5s. 6d. plus 25 per cent, ofIs. 0d^5s. 9d.6. Method of payment. The conversion of the deficiency payments on barley andoats to an acreage basis will be made by the use of a weighted 3-year average yieldincluding the year in question in the same way as in relating production to the standard quantity of wheat or barley. The deficiency payment on wheat will be paid as atpresent, though it will be necessary to make advance payments in respect of someor all of the accounting periods, as the final calculations cannot be made until theaverage market price of wheat over the cereal year is known.Milk7. The provisional standard quantity for each area in 1964/65 will be as follows:Million gallonsChange New Standard Quantity(Provisional) (Provisional)England and Wales     ...      ...        plus 29-8 1,772-3Main Scottish Area     ......        plus 0-4 186-9Aberdeen and District......        plus 0-2 20-0North of Scotland      ......        plus 0-4 9-northern Ireland        ......        plus 1-1 99-38. Hitherto the standard quantities have been adjusted according to changes inliquid sales in the previous calendar year by comparison with the year before. Infuture the adjustment will be in accordance with the change in liquid sales in thecurrent calendar year compared with the previous year. As a transitional measure,the change in the standard quantities between 1963/64 and 1964/65 will reflect thedifference between liquid sales in the calendar years 1962 and 1964.9. The standard quantity in any area will also be adjusted in future so as to maintain a ratio of at least 5 to 1 between liquid sales in the current calendar year and the manufacturing milk within the standard quantity.Fat Cattle and Fat Sheep10. Graduated Deficiency Payments Scheme. The basis of calculation of theguarantee payment for fat cattle and fat sheep will be changed as from the beginningof the 1964/65 fatstock year.11. The present system of calculation of provisional and final weekly rates of guarantee will be discontinued. There will be no announcement of a provisionalrate of guarantee and the stabilising limits will be abolished. The guaranteed pricewill continue, as at present, to be broken down into weekly standard prices varyingseasonally throughout the year.12. In the 1964/65 fatstock year, the difference between the average market price for each week and the standard price for the same week (i.e. the deficiency) will be ascertained. If the deficiency is within the range 23s. 0d.-27s. Od. per live cwt. forcattle and 4-25d.-6d. per lb. estimated dressed carcase weight for sheep, a guaranteepayment of the amount of this deficiency will be paid in respect of the week. If therate of deficiency in a week exceeds 27s. Od. per cwt. in the case of cattle or 6d. per lb.. in the case of sheep, the guarantee payment will be at a rate less than the deficiency.
