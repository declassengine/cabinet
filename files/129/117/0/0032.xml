Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1964CP. (64) 82 Copy No.  5 23rd April, 1964CABINETCONTINENTAL SHELF BILL: REGULATIONSMemorandum by the Minister of power am circulating for the information of the Cabinet, as invited by the economic policy Committee at its meeting on 19th March, this memorandum on my proposalsfor the Regulations under the Continental Shelf Bill. These were approved by theEconomic Policy Committee subject to one point. That point has since been settled in consultation with the Foreign Office, whose views are reflected in thismemorandum. The final stages of the Bill are being taken in the Commons on tuesday, 7th April, when I will be expected to indicate the policies I intend to follow;these are outlined in paragraph 9 below.2. It is desirable that, as soon as possible after the passing of the continental shelf Bill, we should be in a position to authorise licensees to proceed with work.In anticipation of this my Department is pressing on with the preparation of a draftof the Regulations which would govern the conditions of operations and licenceson our Shelf. Some important issues have appeared on which my proposals are asfollows.Prospects and Participants3. The general background against which regulatory powers need to be viewedis as follows. Some 20 concerns, including the Gas Council, have been or aresurveying individually or in concert our North Sea Continental Shelf. Althoughthe companies are reticent about the results, it is clear that the seismic surveys,which indicate the existence of structures which are potentially petroleum* bearing,are encouraging as far as they go. It seems too that the interest of the companies islikely to be concentrated for the present in particular parts of the North Sea, andthere will be strong competition among them for licences for particular areas. Ofthe 20 concerns at present showing interest, about one-quarter are British. Apartfrom one or two exceptions the remainder are American or American-controlled companies. This is not surprising. American oil companies are much more numerousthan British oil companies, and they have had more experience in submarineoperations of this kind. Their expertise and financial resources should be of great assistance in exploring and exploiting the North Sea Area: and we must welcometheir participation in these operations which are both expensive and speculative.Among the American companies we ought to have special regard for those whohave already made major contributions to the British economy e.g., throughbuilding refineries here. On the other hand we would be open to criticism if our arrangements were not of a kind which would give full opportunities for British-controlled concerns up to the limits of their capacity. The case for a special position for British concerns was mentioned by one or two speakers in the Second reading debate. We may well find that British participation, even if specially favoured, isin the aggregate less than American.* Petroleum is a generic noun including both crude oil and natural gas.

General Objective4. I think that in considering our licensing and other arrangements for theContinental Shelf, our main objective must be to secure rapid and thoroughexploration, and the economical exploitation of the Shelf so as to obtain themaximum benefit for our fuel economy. The Regulations should be designed toharness competition among the operators to this end. Together with economic advantages to the community, we may hope to obtain substantial financial benefits. to the Exchequer in the form of royalties and similar payments. However, there are some general limitations which we need to bear in mind. The United Kingdom has very important oil concessions abroad and our companies are under continuouspressure about these. We need to be careful that any arrangements we make inregard to the United Kingdom part of the Continental Shelf do not form an embarrassing precedent for our large and proven overseas investments. We mustbe careful, too, that the financial arrangements are not of a kind which wouldimpede development of the Shelf or add unduly to the costs of fuel won therefrom.5. The general considerations in paragraphs 3 and 4 lead towards one or twospecific points.6. I think we should require that the operating companies be incorporated in the United Kingdom, and arrange their affairs so that the profits of their operations are taxable here. This is common practice and will ensure reasonableequality of financial treatment among the licensees. The companies will be requiredto be residents of the United Kingdom and thus subject to United Kingdomexchange control. But the intention is that this should be administered with due regard to the treatment of international oil companies in other countries. No public statement would be made on this point, but enquiries from the oil companies andOthers would be answered in this sense. It seems necessary that the operation ofExchange Control should be liberal in dealing with these companies in order toavoid undesirable repercussions against the interests of British oil companies inother countries. Royalties would be payable to the Government on the same basis as is adopted in most of the main oil producing countries.Discretion in the Issue of Licences7. The Government could issue licences at discretion, or to the highest bidders,and a choice has to be made between these two methods. In some parts of the world,e.g., United States, concession areas are put up to auction. This has advantages administrative simplicity, impartiality, and financial return to the Exchequer,whether petroleum is found or not. I would not, however, regard a system of that kind as appropriate in dealing with our Continental Shelf at the present time.Under such a system there could be no assurance of British shareholding and I donot think we could face a situation where, as a result of the auctioning of licences,there was little or no British ownership and participation in these developments.Moreover, potentialities in the North Sea are still unproven, and I do not think itwould be right to import into these matters a strong element of financial speculation.Where the operating company is foreign-owned we should take into account howfar British-controlled oil companies receive equitable treatment in the foreign country in question. There are other considerations which in any case make it inevitable that the granting of licences should be a Ministerial discretion. It wouldbe clearly undesirable that these stations off our coasts should be in the ownership,direct or indirect, of unfriendly foreigners. I regard it as essential therefore that Ishould have power to issue or refuse licences at my discretion.Disposal of Products8. Under the Regulations and in the licences I intend to require that in generalpetroleum won on the Continental Shelf should be brought to the United Kingdom.There may, however, be some cases in which it would be right to allow direct exportwith my consent, and this will be provided for. British companies operating in themain producing countries overseas are not subject to such a requirement by theGovernments of these countries, but as the oil produced in those countries is almostentirely for export I do not consider that there is any danger of my proposalsinducing the producing countries to adopt a similar measure.
Statement on Third Reading9. The Regulations, which will be subject to negative resolution, will containmodel clauses to be incorporated in licences, but would, under my proposal, leavethe award of licences to the discretion of the Minister. I propose, however, on third reading of the Bill to indicate briefly and in general terms the considerations whichwill guide me in the award of licences. I propose to say that among the general considerations are the following:First: The need to encourage the most rapid and thorough exploration, andthe economical exploitation of petroleum resources on the continental shelf.Second: The requirement that the applicant for a licence shall be incorporated in the United Kingdom, and that the profits of the operations shall betaxable here.Third: In cases where the applicant is a foreign-owned concern, how far british oil companies receive equitable treatment in that foreign country.Fourth: The programme of work of the applicant, his ability and resources to implement it.Fifth: The contribution which the applicant has already made or is makingtowards the development of the resources of our Continental Shelf and ofour fuel economy generally.I would add that there might be other considerations from time to time, includingconsiderations of national security, which would have to be taken into account:and that I expected that in the event all these considerations would lead to substantial British participation and to the encouragement of other appropriateconcerns whose technical and financial help would be welcome.F. J. E.Ministry of Power, S.W. 1,2nd April, 1964.
