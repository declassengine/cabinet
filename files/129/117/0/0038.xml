(63) 6 COPY NO.      d Il6th December, 196,5CABINETCOMMITTEE ON PENSIONS AND NATIONAL INSURANCESELECTIVITY IN NATIONAL INSURANCE AND NATIONAL assistance memorandum by the Minister of Pensionsmand National InsuranceAt the meeting of the Committee on 25th November (I.N.P. (63)3rd Meeting, Item 2, Conclusion (l)) I ?;as asked to discuss with theChairman of the National Assistance Board, in confidence, the praticability and merits of suggestions, including those outlined inP.N.I,(63) 9, for improving the provision made for people, distinguishedindividually or in classes, with exceptional needs;   and then to circulate to the Committee a memorandum exa&apos;zining proposals for developingprovision made for beneficiaries, whether under national insurance or national assistance, on a selective basis, taking account of need.2.     T?e have now taken further selective steps to expand thepreference for widowed mothers by increasing, and extending the scopeof, the allowances for their children.     But changes of this kind cannotbe described as a new framework for selectivity according to needs.3-     I think there are three different ways in which the scheme could develop.     Whichever we choose as the main line of development, theremay be features in the choices we.reject which we shall find worthincluding.     We can choose between:(i)   Giving or extending preferences for classes easilyidentified;(ii)   Introducing some kind of income guarantee, subject to a means test;(iii)   Developing the scheme on lines already established.J\?J*?.$??SrJt9S:.3 fQr classes easily identified4.     Possible candidates are:-(a) Earnings-related unemployment (and/or sickness) benefit,which could be regarded as a response to a new conception of need (related to previous earnings).     I have circulated in I.N.P. (63) 5 the thoughts I have put before the B.E.C.and the T.U.C. on this subject,(b) Lord Ilford&apos;s recent proposals for special age allowanceswithin national assistance, discussed in Annex I to this paper.(c) Proposals for a higher rate of retirement pension five orten years after minimum retirement age.     I deal with this in Annex II.Some kind of income guarantee, subject to a means test5.     National insurance benefit levels have for so long been belowsubsistence levels, that the Beveridge subsistence basis for national insurance benefit lias been lost.     This has led to the search for some.
method of avoiSLng the alleged stigma of application to the national assistance Board for the quarter of retirement pensioners who maybe in need of assistance.     Both the Labour Party and a number of conservative M.P.&apos;s have suggested a universal declaration of income,which it is claimed would remove any stigma that exists, because itwould apply to all.     Apart from the question whether such a plan couldbe made to work acceptably, the fundamental shortcoming of theLabour Party&apos;s income guarantee plan (&quot;Receive As You Need&quot; or R.A.Y.N.)is that it purports to take account of means (through the universaldeclaration), but exercises no selectivity according to need.     Exceptfor its claim to universality, its main substantial point of differencefrom the existing national assistance system is the proposal toinclude in the income to be guaranteed an average figure for rent allowance and other varying needs.     Rents vary widely throughout thecountry and the proposal is therefore less selective than the present practice of the National Assistance Board.     The Labour Party plancontains no specific commitment as to the level of income guarantee,but it would have to be high enough to take most old people offnational assistance, which would certainly be expensive.     Peoplealready on assistance, whose needs are now precisely assessed, would benefit in inverse proportion to the extent of these needs.     TheLabour Party scheme seems to contain no provision for visiting,without which much valuable welfare work would come to an end.     Thevery universality of the Income Guarantee would tend to cast a realstigma on those still needing national assistance, many of whom wouldbe very deserving cases.6.     Apart from these points of substance, the Labour Party&apos;s planappears to be largely a presentational exercise to suggest thatdevices of procedure and Government machinery (the automatic incomereturn to the Inland Revenue and the creation of a Ministry of social security to take over some of the functions of the national assistance Board) would remove the alleged stigma attaching to national assistance.     The Chief Secretary&apos;s paper of 6th November(I.N.P. (63) 2) shows the impracticability of the universal incomereturn to Inland Revenue.     I am nevertheless examining whether there might not be devised procedures for an income return (other than tothe Inland Revenue) by retirement pensioners which might make recourse to national assistance more palatable for at any rate a proportionof them.     I am not unaware of the importance of presentation in amatter of this kind, but I think it is important that we should recognise that this conception of selectivity is largely a matter of presentation, and that, howovor an income return were made, a personaltest of means would still be involved.     Moreover, v/whatever the test of groans^ it seems quite inevitable that any test of individualneeds would be indistinguishable from that undertaken at present by the National Assistance Board.7.     There is no real evidence to support the contention that a largenumber of needy people are reluctant to apply for national assistance;but, whatever views may be held about this, few people think that theexisting national assistance scheme has not done very well the joballotted to it.     If any change, even in the form of income return,is contemplated, it is quite essential that it should be adopted only after its advantages and disadvantages have been thoroughly explored.If this is not done, there is a serious risk that the change wouldmake worse, not better, provision for people who need financial help,and are at present receiving it through the Board.     The LabourParty proposals look like having precisely this effect:   and we must atall costs avoid this mistake.o
8.      In this context of tho relationship of contributory to moans-testedbenefit, it should be remembered that the Labour Party income guaranteeplan is specifically put forward as a temporary expedient while theparty&apos;s ambitious plans for the development of the contributorygraduated pension mature.     It is claimed that these would then bringthe great bulk of national insurance pensions above the income guarantee level.     The Labour Party is therefore promising an increasingly expansive and dominant role for the State contributorypension and a diminishing role for means-tested benefit,     I do notthink it would accord with Conservative policy to adopt the reverseproposition, although we must clearly stand on our fundamentallydifferent philosophy as to the extent to which the State pension should bo expanded.The development of the scheme on lines already established9.     Whatever the attractions of selective improvements for identifiableclasses, or of any features of an income guarantee scheme, it may wellbe that the continued development of national insurance benefit on lines which are now well established would be more in accordance with ourphilosophy and past policy.     This is the conception that thenational insurance basic pension provides a sure income for the largomajority of people, who have, and are increasingly coming to have,other income of one kind or another.     He should face the fact that the basic pension is not intended to be a subsistence payment, but afoundation, sufficient with other income (including occupational pension, graduated pension and increments for deferred retirement) tobring the great majority of pensioners above the subsistence level.For the minority with insufficient other income, national assistanceexists.     We should pay attention to the way in which national assistance is publioly presented, and we shall no doubt findopportunities to remind our opponents that they would better serve the cause of the needy if they applied their efforts to encouragingrecourse to national assistance, than by denigrating the whole system.10.   Under our conception of national insurance, we should encourageindividual provision to supplement the basic pension, and thedevelopment of the graduated element in the national insurance pension(or the equivalent occupational pension for the contracted-out) sothat it played a more dominant role than under the present scheme,where the dynamic element is the basic pension.     In the meantime,it is on that dynamic element in the national insurance pension thatthe expectations of existing pensioners and millions of contributorswithin a few years of retirement age must be centred.     This pension is a necessary condition of increasing private provision because,with too big a gap between the contributory pension and assistance,many people would not find it worth while to save.11.   I should be grateful for tho views of my colleagues.R.f.Ministry of Pensions and National insurance,VT  P   O;&apos; . u . c. .16th December, 1963
ANNEX special AGE ALLOWANCE   WITHIN NATIONAL assistance as the Committee knows, Lord Ilford has suggested that the national assistance scheme should contain provision for the payment of an age allowance.He maintains that people who have for some time been on national assistance, orliving at similar standards, will need re-placement of clothing, bedding andblankets and other things, whioh cannot fully be provided by the ordinary weeklypayments of national assistance.     He thinks that advancing age normallyincreases need, because of infirmity and a generally greater dependence on thesmall comforts of life.     Lord Ilford therefore proposes that people of over 75on regular weekly national assistance allowances should automatically receive a quarterly lump sum payment of  5 or  6.     He thinks that payments of this kindwill help to meet particular personal needs which a great many old people areshy of discussing with the officers of the National Assistance Board.2.     The proposition raises these issues;(a) Do people over 75* as a class, have special needs which do not also apply to other people, such as chronic invalids, who are younger than75?(b) In order to deal with younger people with similar needs, the proposed new quarterly payment might also have to be made (possibly on a discretionary basis) to those of any age who had been receivingnational assistance for at least five years.     It is this presumptionwhich is behind the proposal for the automatic allowance for the aged.This would include not only the long-term invalids, who often have atleast equal need for additional financial help.     Many others, likedeserted wives with a number of children, probably have to live on assistance for a long tine, and have the difficult task, of bringingup their children respectably and without humiliation.     To extend the quarterly payment to people of this kind, would considerablyextend its scope, not only because it would include many people ofall ages, but because anyone retiring at 65 and going straight on to national assistance would become eligible for it at the age of 70.(c) The suggested new quarterly payment would probably remove the need for most of the non-recurring &quot;exceirtional needs grants&quot; for things likeclothing, but the cost of these grants in 1962 was less than  1 million,compared with the  30 million which the now proposal might cost,assuming that it were extended as in (b) above.     This would fallwholly on the Exchequer.(d) The present system of &quot;discretionary additions&quot; paid on top of thenational assistance scale rates for such special needs as additionalfuel, laundry, special diets and domestic help would have to continuestheir total cost is  22 million a year.(e) Apart from the actual merits of the proposal, I should be grateful for the Committee&apos;s view about the political ?;isdom of taking such astep in the remaining lifetime of this Parliament.     The Labour party is proposing an Income Guarantee scheme, which is discussed in thismemorandum.     This has the avowed purpose of replacing national assistance in many cases.     Would it be wise for us to take steps toincrease its scope?     It night also be difficult to bring in any allowance of this kind in isolation from a general increase in all the scales of national assistance, which have actually gained narginallyin real value since the new rates were introduced last May.(f) Many of our supporters are concerned with the wider issue ofcontributory versus means-tested benefits in the future developmentof our social security provisions.     An announcement before the end.
of this Parliament that we were proposing a special allowance forany categories of national assistance recipients would suggest thatwe   had decided it was right to develop selectivity byway of neans-tested national assistance payments and not by developing the contributory national insurance scheme.3. I should like to give further study to the issues raised by Lord Ilford&apos;proposal, and discuss it with the C omit tee early next year.2.
annex IIPROPOSALS FOR A HIGHER RATIO OF FwSTIKSMBMT PENSION FOR OLDERPMSIONIOESThe scope and nature of a differential for older retirement pensioners would depend considerably on the age pattern chosen.   The age for men could probably most suitably be either 70 or 75*   The age forwomen could be t1 e same as for men, or five years younger like theminimum retirement age.   It would, have to be decided whether a wifereceived the differential at the same time as her husband or, more probably, when she herself reached the fixed age.2.     On the basis of a uniform age for all men and women, a differential fromthe age of 70 would benefit about 3*4^0,000 of the 5j850,000 retirement pensioners?   one from the age of 75 would benefit about 1,800,000.3.   Advantages of a differential(-0   Selective.   An age differential would be a selective form ofimprovement to a group who command considerable public sympathy and would thus help to implement the Government&apos;s pledge to concentrate futurebenefits on the groups most in need of help,(ii) &quot;Older generation&quot;.   To a considerable extent the extra pension would go now to those who were in their prime between the Wars and who thereforehad less opportunity for savings and less chance than present employees of joining an occupational pension scheme,(iii) Higher proportions on assistance.   Although the pattern is notcompletely clear, there is a definite tendency for the proportion of retirement pensioners receiving supplements from the Board to increase withage.(iv$   Greater needs of old age.   There is some evidence that, with advancingyears, many pensioners may need greater financial help because they are lessable to do things for themselves and because, after some years on pension,their stock of clothing, furnishings and other durable goods will havebeen depleted.   This is the same thought that has led Lord Ilford tosuggest that national assistance recipients over 75 should receive aquarterly lump sum payment (see Annex i),(v)   Effect on accepted age of retirement.     It is sometimes argued that thepayment of a higher pension at a later age would help to break down the idea that the minimum pension ages were the times at which retirement took place and ought to take place.   The logical (and selective) instrument here is thesystem of increments for postponed retirement.     It is, however, doubtfulwhether a differential for all at 70 could influence attitudes much 5   if75 were chosen the argument would not be worth advancing.4*   Disadvantages of a differential(i)   Difficulty of establishing greater need among the group.   Although atfirst sight the caso for higher pensions at older ages appears to be good,on closer examination it might be difficult to maintain under pressurethat most people over 70 or 75 are in special need.   They will include alarge proportion of the late-age entrants who are on the whole not badlyoff and received pension on particularly favourable terms after ten years&apos;insurance.   They will also include a growing number of people with incrementsof pension arising from deferred retirement, and some people who are stillin full-time employment.   The argument that this age group has been handicappedas a result of the inter-war years will steadily lose force.1.COKSPTOiMTSAL
(ii) Difficulty of maintaining differential amongjretirgment pensioners.Contrasting with pensioners otpt 7? or 75 who were in comfortablecircumstances would be pensioners under the chosen age who were in difficulties, for example, the chronic invalid who had to take hisretirement pension, at the standard rate, at 65*     There would also bethe problem of women pensioners who tend, in general, to have fewerresources than men.     It is relevant that in 1951 the LabourGovernmenfs proposal for a differential from age 70 (65 for women)had to be modified, as a result of back bench pressure,  to include,transitionally, all existing pensioners;    and the differential was infact swept away altogether in 1952 by a Conservative Government, which took credit for restoring uniform rates of benefit.(iii) Diffioulty of^withholding frorn^ other^ national insurance benIt would also be difficult to defend givrng a differential to everyone overa certain age, but not to certain people below pension age who attractparticular sympathy.     The case for the same differential for the widowedmother was accepted in the Labour Government&apos;s 1951 Act;    its force mayhave been reduced by the special increases given for her children inrecent years, but there would still be pressure in this quarter, and also from others such as the chronic sick - especially those with families -who are unlikely to have had the same opportunity as pensioners to providethemselves with additional resources.(^v) N^tiona]^ assistance repercussions.t    The national insurance differentialfor the old would, by itself, provide no extra total income for many of the poorest old people whose benefit is now supplemented by the national assistance Board.     This would probably attract criticism and would be overcome only by a national assistance differential for the old or by thedisregard of some part of national insurance retirement pension by the Board.Both of these ideas would mean a fundamental departure from the presentsystem of assistance, which seeks to provide help on the basis of individualneed;    and any attempt to disregard a portion of national insurance benefits would be open to grave objections.(v)   Non-pensioners.     There are about two-thirds of a million people overpension age but not entitled to a retii-ement pension, many of whom were tooold to join the scheme in 1948.     Many had no opportunity of joining theprevious schemes.     All those too old to join the scheme in 1948 must nowbe over 80 (men) and 75 (women), and most of them will be considerablyolder.     Since pensions became payable in 1958 to late-age entrants, thesenon-pensioners have conducted a grcwinglyvociferous campaign to be allowed a pension on similarly advantageous terms.     Any differential based on age,paid to late-age entrants among others, would make it more difficult to resist paying pensions to this other group, who are considerably older.     Thecost of standard rate pensions to non-pensioners and others over pension age not now entitled to pension would at present be about  80 million ayear net after national assistance savings.
HIGHER RATES OF BENEFIT FOR OLDER PENSIONERSMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National InsuranceThis paper explores the possibility of introducing higher benefits for people over 75o     It considers such a move in national assistance andin national insurance.2.     I attach as Appendix A to . this paper a preliminary analysis of anational assistance scheme which looks possible if the questions it posescan be acceptably answered.     It is in the field of national assistance that we should naturally look for selectivity according to &quot;need&quot; in thefull sense.     It might be possible (but see paragraph 4 below) to giveolder people preferential treatment in national assistance alone, but Ido not think it would be practicable to give it to them in national insurance without similar treatment in national assistance.3.     The case for a national insurance preference for pensioners over75 is considered in Appendix B.     I think a respectable case can be made out forpreferential national insurance treatment for older retirement pensioners, on the ground that survival to that age creates for the survivors as &amp; group a contingency of worsened circumstances.     they become more dependent on the services of others and have fewer resourcesother than the national insurance pension.     These are circumstances forwhich it is proper for national insurance to make provision.     this raises the question of the long-term sick on national insurance.   Similarpreferential treatment could not be extended to them without creatingirresistible pressures for its extension to younger retirement pensioners,widows and others,     A possible answer is that long-term sickness is amisfortune not confined to any age group, and more properly dealt withby national assistance supplementation of the national insurance benefit in the absence of sufficient other income.4.     All this is very much a matter of political judgment,     I think itis relevant to this judgment that, if preferential treatment for the agedwere introduced into national assistance and not into national insurance,present and prospective pensioners might vie?f it with alarm as an indica-tion of the Government&apos;s intention to concentrate improvements for the oldon means-tested benefit to the neglect of the national insurance retirement pension.     I am sure we must avoid such an impression.     If, on the otherhand, preferential national insurance treatment for the aged pensionerwent hand in hand with preferential national assistance treatment, it couldbe represented as a development of the insurance scheme consistent withthe principle set out in paragraph 9 of my paper of l6th December tothe Committee (I.N.P. (63) 6):the basic pension is not intended to be a subsistencepayment, but a foundation, sufficient with other income(including occupational pension, graduated pension and incrementsfor deferred retirement) to bring the great majority of pensionersabove the subsistence level.&quot;9 7I.N.P. (Q*) 4 COPY NO.29th January, 1964CABINETCOMMITTEE ON PENSIONS AND NATIONAL INSURANCE
We should in effect be saying that within this principle the foundationpayment ought to be a bit higher for those over 75.5.     Any announcement of special beneficial intention towards the agedcannot at present be swiftly implemented;   nor can it yet be mounted onan all-round increase of national insurance and national assistancerates of benefit which would enable us to demonstrate that thepreference for the aged was not to be wholly at the expense of otherbeneficiaries.R.W.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance,W.C.2.29th January, 196k
This appendix considers the implications of giving a special assistanceallowance to old people and to others who have lived a long time on national assistance,2,     Any special allowance in the national assistance scheme, which isintended to deal with people in accordance with their individual needs, wouldhave to he defensible on the basis of a special need peculiar to the classconcerned.     It is doubtful whether old people as a class have special needsnot shared by others - in particular, but by no means exclusively, by the chronic sick.3o     A possible course might be to introduce a special allowance which would go automatically to people of 75 and over who were on national assistance, andwould also go to younger people who had teen dependent on the Eoard for asubstantial time, say five years or more,4.     The purpose of the special allowance would be to give additional help to long-term recipients of assistance.     The automatic inclusion of the over-75&apos;scould be justified on the grounds that most of them have probably spent aconsiderable time on assistance or at least on a seriously reduced level ofexpenditure&quot;   and that most of them are virtually certain to continue on assistance for the rest of their lives.     It could be claimed that the people who would benefit from this special allowance are likely to need, unlike most people who are on assistance for a short time, to replace major items of clothing and bedding and other household goods, and that it is reasonable alsoto make modest provision in their case for certain amenities, such as anoccasional holiday.5.     It would probably be undesirable to have a different age qualification for men and women, in spite of the difference in the minimum pension age.The qualifying formula for the new allowance for people over retirement agemight be simply &quot;aged 75 or five years on assistance, whichever is the sooner&quot;.6.     There are a number of questions which call for detailed considerations should everyone over 759 whether a householder or not, who was on assistancebe included automatically and on the same basis, ignoring for example the factthat household replacements (a major factor in the justification of the pro-posed additional allowance) may bear quite differently on people who are nothouseholders?     Should the fact that a person or a married couple had earningsons and daughters living with them be a factor to be taken into account?Should any regard be had to capital, which again puts different recipients ofnational assistance in an entirely different position in relation to such things as replacements and holidays?     There are also special considerations in regard to national assistance recipients who may be in Part III accommoda-tion, hospitals, nursing homes, etc,, and who are already receiving somethingdifferent from the normal scale rates,     (These last considerations inparticular mean that the additional allowance can hardly be completelyautomatic, even for the old people,)7.     The principle of an additional allowance for long-term recipients ofnational assistance would presumably have to apply also to people belowretirement age on the basis of a qualifying period of five years.     If this were not done, many people with needs similar to those of the over-75&apos;s on assistance would be denied the benefit of the improvement proposed.Paragraph 2 mentions particularly the chronic sick.8.     There would again be a number of decisions to take.     For instance -(1)   How should the broad principle of having been on assistance for five years be applied to younger people?     Should it be subject to anyfurther qualification, or should it be subject only to the general dis-cretion always exercised by the Board?     Such discretion will be unavoidable, in order to deal with complications like broken periods,and, in some cases, to exclude people where there seemed good reason todo so,
(2)   Should there be a more specific definition at least of some ofthose under retirement age who should receive the special allowance,leaving others not specifically covered by the definition to beincluded on a discretionary basis?(3)   Should the special allowance be restricted in the case of youngerpeople to those who are householders, those who have no independentearners living with them, and those who have not more than a certainamount of capital etc?     The considerations mentioned in paragraph 6 are equally relevant here.(4)   Should the special addition be varied in accordance with the totalnumber of dependants?9.     The method of payment of the special allowance would also needconsideration.     The Chairman of the Board in his personal Memorandum stressed the advantages of quarterly payments, but it would be necessary to marry themethod of payment with any increases that might be made on the insurance side.10.   Until the questions posed in paragraphs 6 and 8 are further examined,no firm estimate of cost can be given.     The following very tentative figures are offered by way of illustration.     The approximate national assistancecost of -(1)   an increase in the scale of 5s. a week (8s. 6d. for a married couple)for those over 75 on assistance and other retired people who had been on assistance for at least five years =  13 million ( 7 million of this wouldbe offset if 5s. (8s. 6d.) were given at the same time on pensions at 75)I(2)   the special allowance payable to younger people if it were restricted to the long-term sick who had been five years on assistance, with specialdiscretionary additions in other cases = about  2 million (about  1 millionif householders only were included)5(3)   the special allowance payable to younger people if it were given toall or almost all those who had been on assistance for five years or morewithout restriction as to category =  7 million.11.   The cost of a 5s. a week supplement(8s, 6d. for a married couple) or itsquarterly equivalent, paid to everyone over 75 on assistance and broadly to everyone who had been on assistance for at least five years (paragraph 10,(1) plus (3)) would therefore be something like  20 million.      7 million ofthis would be offset if similar increases in national insurance were made for those over 75&apos;4.
This appendix considers the implications of paying a higher rate of retirement pension to older pensioners.2.     There have been two exceptions to the Beveridge policy of uniform ratesof national insurance benefits.     The first was the Labour Government1 sincrease for older pensioners and widowed mothers in 1951*   This exceptionwas brought to an end in 1952 when the Conservative G-overnment restoreduniform benefits.   The second is the preferential rate of children&apos;allowances which we introduced in 1956 for widowed mothers.   We have since increased this, and are increasing it again in the present Bill.The preference for widowed mothers has been generally accepted to be properto a contributory insurance scheme because of the special problems of bringing up a child without a father&apos;s help.3.     It would similarly seem necessary to justify a differential for the older pensioner in national insurance terms.   It would not be enough to showthat there are some older pensioners who have special needs, because theseare dealt with through the national assistance scheme.     Some evidence orstrong presumption would be needed that the main body of older pensionerswere in a special position which could properly be covered by national insurance.   In 1954, the Phillips Committee on the Economic and financial problems of the Provision for Old Age obtained medical evidence which ledthem to say:-&quot;To the extent that old age entails dependence on others for services previously self-supplied, old age first becomes a majorcontributory factor in the period from 70 to 75 years of age.   Thisis true of both men and women.&quot;This could be used to support an argument that, while the retirement pension payable from minimum pension age is intended as an insurance benefit againstthe contingency of loss of earnings on-retirement,&apos; ^subsequent agev-differential would be an insurance benefit payable to compensate, at least in part, for the changes of old age which made persons more dependent onothers for services.   Another argument would be that of erosion of resources.As the years pass from retirement, most old people tend to find their resources eroded, so that it is reasonable for an insurance scheme toprovide higher benefits for periods after this is likely to have happened.Against this, it can be shown that more than two-thirds of retirement pensioners over 75 manage without recourse to national assistance.   Someof these have substantial resources and will need an increase in their national insurance pension much less than a number of other youngernational insurance beneficiaries.4.     Preferential treatment for older pensioners would stimulate pressure for concessions for younger retirement pensioners and people belowpension age.   The treatment of long-term invalids is probably the most difficult question.   It could be argued that much the same considerations apply to them, in that they are more dependent on other people for servicesand also that any resources tend to disappear.   If any conoession were madeto them, it would be extremely difficult to contain, because chronic invalidsbecome retirement pensioners and it would be quite impossible to take away from then a differential benefit because they were 65.   There would then bea group of younger pensioners with a differential rate, which it would become increasingly difficult to deny to other younger pensioners in ill-health.The breach in the line drawn between younger and older pensioners would mean that the differential rate would increasingly become the general rate ofbenefit.5.    The advantages, disadvantages and cost of a differential would vary considerably according to its amount and the age at which it was paid.   Adecision on the amount would not be easy.   Three considerations would haveto be reconciled:-
(l)   It would be difficult to introduce a differential except aspart of a general uprating of benefits.(2)   The general increase must be enough not to seem derisory andwould at least have to match the rise in prices.(3)   The cost should not be materially greater than would have been involved in a uniform all-round increase,60     The age at which the differential was fixed would greatly affect the costand therefore the extra increase which could be afforded.     The higher the agethe smaller the cost.     But there are general grounds for choosing a fairlyhigh age,    For men, there seems much to be said for taking the age of75.     At 70, a significant number of men are still working and some will justhave retired from work with a fully incremented retirement pension.     After 75the regular supplementation of pension by earnings would seem lesspracticable.    Even more important, the selection of 75 would make this concession a very special one and would reduce the repercussions in other national insurance fields.     There are about two million men pensioners!nearly a third of them are over 7507.     The age for women would best be the same as for men.    Women have a greaterexpectation of life, and there is little medical evidence to support a lowerage for them.     If 75 were the age for women, as well as for men, this should apply to wives with pension on their husband insurance as well as to womeninsured in their own right.     Of about four million women pensioners, againnearly a third are over 75*8,     There are nearly six million retirement pensioners, of whom rather lessthan two million are over 75*      45 million would be the isolated cost of a differential of 10s, a week for pensioners over 75, with 6s. a week for apensioner wife over 75.     If a differential were introduced at a time when ageneral increase in national insurance rates became necessary, the cost of the differential might be offset, partly or wholly, by a reduction in the amount ofthe general increase which would otherwise have been given.    Eor instance,instead of a general increase in all the standard rates of national insurance benefits of 10s. - as in 1963 - it would be possible within the same cost tohave a general increase of 7s, 6d. with an increase of 17s. 6d. (i.e., 10s.extra) for those over the age of 75.6

(6k) .6 COPY NO., ^_ 6th March, 1964CABINETCOMMITTEE ON PENSIONS AND NATIONAL INSURANCEPROBLEMS OF CONTRACTING OUTMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National InsuranceIntroductoryThe 1959 Act introduced graduated national insurance pensions and contributions.     It was then thought essential to allow people to contract out from both in order to safeguard existing occupational schemes and to ensurethat those continued to develop.     Two main conditions for those contracting out wore thats-(l) thoy must bo guaranteed an occupational pension not less than theamount tho State scheme would provide for those constantly payinggraduated contributions at tho maximum rate?(2)   thoy must pay an additional flat-rato contribution instead of graduated contributions.     The reason for this was that all workers,whether contracted out or not, remain entitled to all national insurance benefits othor than tho graduated pension^    and part oftho graduated contributions helps to pay for tho flat-rate benefits.2.     I am sure it was right to choose this form of contracting out in 1959*Tho graduated scheme has been launched very smoothly, and tho structure of occupational pensions strengthened, but certain problems arc now developing.They are due partly to the changes forced on occupational pensions schemes bythe enlargement of the State nchome since 1959 and partly to the possibilityof other changes in the State scheme.Problems needing attention5.     These arc tho main problemss-(a)   The additional flat-rato contribution boars hardly on tho lower-paidcontracted-out,     Their total contribution is greater than it would hoif thoy wore participating in the scheme.     On tho othor hand, higher paid contractod-oui-&quot;workers iand their employers are contributing lesstowards flat-rato benefits &quot;than those participating.     This did notmatter much as long as tho amounts involved were small and until thespan of earnings which attract graduated contributions was increasedlast Juno.     Since then a man earning  18 or more a week has paid a contribution to national insurance of 15s, 11-gd. if participating inthe scheme, but 10s, 8jgd. if contracted-out,     Tho difference of5s, 3d, is considerably more than can bo justified in relation to thoamount of State pension which ho forgoes by being contracted-out.A man earning  9 a week also pays 10s. 8-igd. if contracted-out,compared with 8s. 3:^d, if participating;    in cither case he isqualifying for tho same amount of State pension and othor benefits.This is much harder to defend.     These difficulties will be augmented by tho further increase in contributions in April 1965already provided for in legislation, and by any further incroasonecessary when benefits arc next raised.1.
(b) Whatever they earn, people who are contracted-out have to beprovided under their own occupational scheme with pension rightsequivalent to the maximum that could be earned over the same period(by a worker earning  18 a week or more) in the graduated part ofthe State scheme.   Each time the span of earnings which attractgraduated contributions is extended, the level of this pensionprovision is increased.   When the 1959 legislation was passed, thebenefit rates were such that a man contracted-out v&amp;th earnings of  9 a T?eek would be paying contributions geared to a pension ofat least  6 2s. (State plus occupational) for himself and his wife.This did not mean that he would get  6 2s. when he retired, becausehis earnings, money values, pension rates and other conditionsmight by that time have changed a great deal.    6 2s. was, however,a measure of the provision he was being required currently to make and, therefore, of the reasonableness of his contribution liabilityjit was a reasonable proportion of his earnings and did not involvetoo heavy a contribution burden.   But as a result of the changessince 1959 the contracted-out man on  9 is now contributing for pension rights of at least  8 12s. for his wife and himself.   Thisis considerably more than his take-home pay, and it involves a heavy contribution in relation to his earnings.   His total state contribution (including that for the national health service) is14s. Id. - on top of which is any contribution to his occupational scheme,   A further general increase of benefit rates and contribution-tions on the same pattern as last year1s, even if more modest in amount, would raise this  8 12s. to something well over  10.   Thiswsuld &amp;e quite disproportionate to his earnings and would be an intolerable contribution burden.   These large increases in thecontributions of the lower paid contracted-out (and in the levelof pensien for which they are paying) are due mainly to theextension ef the span of earnings liable to graduated contribution-tions; and it is virtually certain that this span would have tobe widened beyond  18 a week (thus increasing the amount ofpension which employers have to provide), if benefit rates wereto be improved.(c) If we decide to introduce earnings-related unemployment orsickness benefit, it must be supported by earnings-relatedcontributions, part of which must be paid by the employee.   Wecould not exclude from the earnings-related benefits thoseemployees who are contracted out of the State graduated pension scheme, so we must provide for the payment of graduated contribu-tions by those contracted out.   This is not practicable withinthe present contribution structure.(d) Under present arrangements the level of flat-rate pension can beincreased from time to time to maintain or improve its real value in face of rising prices.   But it would be very difficult toincrease the graduated part r f the pension and thus maintain itsreal value, because such an increase could not be matched bycontracted-out schemes.   So far, since 1961 the value of graduated pensions has not been significantly eroded, but the trouble isbuilding up for the future.(e) Although a husband&apos;s graduated contributions provide some widow-hood cover, this is lost on contracting out, and it is impracticableunder present arrangements to require such cover to be provided asa condition for contracting out.   The amounts involved are atpresent too small to cause serious dissatisfaction, but there hasalready been criticism and there may be trouble ahead.4.     The development of occupational pension schemes and the approach tocontracting out may be increasingly affected by the fears of employers whoare contracted out that they would be unable to match developments which a future Government might import into the State scheme, particularly if theGovernment were in time forced to revalue graduated pension rights earned in the past.2,
ConfidentialOutline ofisuggested change5.     I have come to the conclusion that it would he right, when national insurance benefits are next increased, to change the method of contracting out.   The purpose of the new system is to overcome the problems listed inparagraph 3;    to continue to avoid an undue overlap between national insurance and occupational provision;    and to encourage the spread of occupational prevision above the general national insurance level.   It mustnot force employers to choose between either excluding their lower-paid workers from contracting out or over-pensioning them, with the very heavycontribution this makes necessary.6.     The employer who Is now contracted-out has to provide Is. 4d. a week in occupational pension for each year of contracted-out employment.   I proposethat this obligation should continue but, instead of being regarded asalternative to the State graduated pension, it should simply be offset by anabatement of the total State provision made for the worker in question.   the contracted-out would no longer be exempt from the ordinary graduated contributions and excluded from the ordinary graduated pension;    instead,their total State pension would be abated by an amount related to the pensioncompulsorily guaranteed by the employer.    In consideration of this, theirflat-rate national insurance contributions (instead of being higher than thoseof people fully within the State scheme) would be abated by a fixed amountactuarially assessed as appropriate to the obligation assumed by the employer and to the commitment of which the State would be relieved.7.    This change would overcome the difficulties mentioned in paragraphs 3 and4 above.     In particular it would provide a basis on the contribution side fora system of earnings-related short-term benefits.    Existing contracted-outschemes would continue to satisfy the conditions for contracting out,although some employers might eventually want tq reconsider their arrangementsbecause the altered contribution structure would affect the balance ofadvantage in contracting out.        There is the further advantage that thechange in contribution arrangements could be introduced in any April providedthat all decisions of principle and of detail were made, say, six months inadvance.   If introduced, graduated short-term benefits vfould have to startrather later.Level of abatement8.     If the contribution rebate for the contracted-out were too strictlycalculated in relation to the amount of State pension forgone, a large partof the incentive to contract out would be removed, and the contracting-outarrangements would no longer do anything to encourage provision underoccupational schemes better than that under the State scheme.    encouragement of the best development of occupational schemes was one of the stated purposesof the present system.    We could keep this desirable element in the system ifemployers who contracted out their workers had to provide a greater amount ofpension than the amount forgone under the State scheme.    While the employerwould be required to provide Is. 4d.. a week for each year of contracted-outemployment, the amount of State pension forgone by his workers might belimited to, say, Is. a week.     This ivould enable us to allow a fairlygenerous contribution rebate in relation to the State pension forgone,although it would be modest in relation to the occupational pension required of the employer.      This is not an essential feature of my proposals, butI attach importance to it.     It would innort a clear social purpose intoa move which we might otherwise appear to be making for technical reasons only.Broad effects on individual contributors9.     For all those now participating in the graduated pension scheme therewould be no change beyond the addition of earnings-related short-term benefits(if we decide to introduce them) and an increase in the graduated contributionto support them.     The worker contracted-out and earning  18 a week or more would have the same national insurance retirement pension entitlement as atpresent.   His contributions would also earn a prospective graduated retirement pension for his widow, a benefit now usually lost when he is contracted out
(see paragraph 3(e)).   His contribution would be rather more than he paysnow.   This increase would in part pay for the cover for his widow and in partrectify the existing bias in his favour.     Paragraph 3(a) explained that he atpresent contributes considerably less towards flat-rate benefits than a man with the same earnings who is contracted in.   Men contracted-out and earning 9 a week or less would have their contributions greatly reduced.   Theirprospective national insurance pensions would be reduced by the amount of the abatement (is. a week for each year of contracted-out employment), but their national insurance and occupational pensions taken together would be greaterthan the pensions of men with the same earnings who had been contracted in.The position of those earning between  9 and  18 a week would fall between thesetwo extremes.     The effect of the changes is set out in more detail in the annex to this paper.Possible difficulties and objections10,   Because the rebate would be the same irrespective of age, the suggestedn    change would give a substantial financial incentive to employers to contract out their younger employees, as in their case it costs less, commercially, toprovide for them the compulsory level of pension.     This incentive already exists, but is largely countered by the disincentive to contract out lower paid(and generally younger) employees.     We could not entirely prevent employerstaking advantage of this opportunity for financial advantage at the expense ofthe National Insurance Fund, but defences can be devised to prevent anysubstantial and organised abuse.11.   The removal of the present disincentive to contract out lower-paid workers should make it easier for employers to make further occupationalprovision for lower paid workers and also produce some immediate increase incontracting out.     Employers may also be encouraged by the removal of the fearsreferred to in paragraph 4, but it is true that the new arrangements whichremove these fears also make it technically possible to develop the Stateprovision without forcing corresponding changes on those contracted-out.   Tothis extent the change may be thought to remove a technical barrier against theundue enlargement of State provision which, whatever form it takes, must in thelong run be destructive of occupational and private provision.     But the over-inflation of the State scheme is likely to be prevented less by maintainingtechnical barriers against it than by:-(l)   strengthening the common concern of occupational schemes, in many ofwhich trade unions have a strong interest, by involving them all,whether contracted-out or not, in the payment of graduated contributions.(2)   maintaining a strong bias in the State scheme in favour of lower-paid workers, and so making sure that better-paid workers will prefer to seek better provision for themselves through an occupational scheme or other private provision rather than through State action.12.   Although these proposals involve a departure from the arrangements embodied in the Government&apos;s 1959 Act, it is only those concerned in contracting out whowould be affected and they are already aware of the difficulties which face them,as well as us, when the contribution rates next have to be adjusted.Representatives of the Life Offices recently asked for discussions with myofficials and said that, if some further substantial alteration in the schemebecame necessary, they would like a system of the kind I am proposing.   Inparticular they said that their members would be likely to favour the idea,discussed in paragraph 8, that employers contracting out should have to providea greater amount of pension than the amount forgone under the State scheme.Timing13.   Under the 1959 Act, contribution rates will go up in April 1965 to meet the growing cost of existing benefits.   When the time comes, it may be difficult toavoid introducing benefit increases, which will need still more contribution income.   The problems mentioned in paragraph 3(a) and (b) would then becomeurgent.   If these problems were dealt with on the lines discussed above,legislation would be necessary at the latest this autumn and a broad decision4.
would have to he taken early in the summer. This timetable accords with the related proposal to introduce earnings-related short-term benefits.Finance14*.   The contribution changes examined in this paper would probably increaseimmediate income and produce a rather more buoyant income for the future. Ifthere were an abatement of Is. a week in the pension for each year ofcontracted-out service, the reduction in contribution would probably be between   Is, 6d. and 2s. 6d. a week   each for employer and employee.   Ifthis reduction were fixed at 2s. and there were no consequent change in thenumbers contracted-out, the extra income would be about  36 million a yearimmediately.   The effect on the numbers contracted-out is hard to assess,but if a further million were contracted out the extra income would be about 1$ million less.Conclusion15.   I hope the Committee will agree that we should adopt the proposal putforward in this paper.    If we do so, there is no need for an early announcement but it would provide the only foundation on which we couldcommit ourselves to introduce earnings-related short-term benefits.   whatever decision we reach on that problem, which is discussed in my memorandum I.N.P. (64-) 7?   it is essential that we should satisfy ourselves in the nearfuture that we are prepared to meet the problems which will arise whencontributions go up in April 1965, as well as those arising when benefitrates are next increased.E.

Effects of^hejproposal on^ jjidivi^dualsThe attached table illustrates the effect on individualcontributors of the proposals in this paper.     It is based on theassumption that the contribution rebate for the contracted-out would be 2s. in return for a reduction of State pension of 1s. aweek per year of contracted-eut employment and an obligation onthe employer to provide 1s. 4d. a week by way of occupational pension.     These figures are tentative.Sectien A of the table relates to men participating in theState graduated pension scheme f9r whom there would be no changeunder the proposed system.     Sections B and C relate to mencontracted-out under the present system and under the proposedsystem.     Comparing C with A one can see how men who are contracted&apos;out would fare compared with those participating.     A comparison of C with B shows the effect of the changes on men who arecontracted- out.The figures in the right-hand part of the table show the pension (for single men) which would become payable after a working life at the earning level shswn and with benefit ratesunchanged.    There are two reasons why these figures are unreal.A man&apos;s earnings do not remain unchanged for 47 years;   and, moreimportant, the rates of benefit may be expected substantially toincrease over a working life.    The figures, therefore, show no more than the rate at which entitlement to pension would accrueduring the early years of the proposed system.The table shows that men contracted-out and earning  15 a,week or less will get a smaller &apos;Net State Pension&apos; than theirpresent expectations.     On the other hand, a general increaseof benefit rates of 5s. every five years (much less than thepresent pattern of increases) will make sure that no one wouldactually be awarded a State pension of less than the present standard amount of 67s. 6d.    The reason for this is that theamount of the abatement need not be increased as the pension rateswent up.6.

COMMITTEE ON PENSIONS AND NATIONAL INSURANCEEARNINGS-RELATED SHORT-TERM benefits memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National InsuranceIntroductoryI promised the Committee on 10th February (I.N.P. (64) 1st Meeting,Conclusion l(3)), to put forward a paper containing the essentials forany scheme of earnings-related short-term benefits.2.     My predecessor set out (in P.N.I. (63)6) the principles on whichgraduated short-term benefits might be based within the framework of thepresent scheme, and summarised the conclusions then reached.     Theproblems involved have since been discussed with representatives 0:&quot; theemployers (B.E.C.) and the T.U.C.     This paper takes account of these discussions.Amount of benefit3.     Most people will want to know what extra benefit they would get froman earnings-related scheme and what they would have to pay for it.Earnings-related benefit would supplement the present uniform flat-ratebenefits, with allowances for dependants, which would remain the basicprovision.     Graduated contributions for this supplement could only be collected on the same band of earnings as for graduated pension (atpresent  9 -  18 a week) and the supplement would have to be related to earnings in that band.     Those earning  9 a week or less would not be eligible for the supplement.     This would not affect many men, but would cut out the majority of women, whose average weekly earnings are under 8 10s.4.     For people earning between  9 and  18 a week, the supplement would bea proportion of their earnings within that band.     What should thatproportion be?   A single person at present gets  3 7s. 6d. flat-ratebenefit, payable on the first  9 of earnings.     If the amount payable onthe second  9 (that part of earnings between  9 and  18) were more tnan 3 7s. 6d., it would provide a higher proportionate compensation for lossof earnings above  9 a week.     This would treat the higher-paid workerbetter than the lower paid.     The graduated addition to the present flat-rate benefits could not therefore be a bigger proportion of gross earnings than the ratio of  3 7s. 6d. to  9 - i.e., three-eighths.   Thiswould not be too far out of line with the standard set by the graduated pension scheme, where the maximum graduated pension after a lifetime of contributions is an addition of  3 3s. a week to the flat-rateretirement pension.5. Another consideration supports a graduated addition of about this size. The flat-rate benefit of a single man on about average earnings( 16 a week) is at present only 27 per cent of his net earnings, but a married man with two children gets 49 per cent; and with six ohildren68 per cent. People earning substantially less than the average get a much higher proportion. Much of the publicity on this question has emphasised the reduction in income which a single man suffers when hisCOPY6th March, 1964CABINET1.
earnings stop, and has ignored tho substantial additions for a wife andchildren. A substantially larger graduated supplement for higher-paidsingle men might make it necessary to apply a &quot;wage-stop&quot; for a married man with children.6.     The following table shows (l) the total benefit (flat-rate andgraduated) payable at different levels of earnings for different familiesif the graduated supplement were exactly three-eighths of gross earnings in the  9 to  18 band;   and (2) the proportion benefit would be of netearnings:- 10 a	week	 16 a	week	 18 a	week total of	Benefit	Total of	Benefit	Total of	Benefitflat-rate	as a	flat-rate	as a	flat-rate	as aplus	percentage	plus	percentage	plus	percentagegraduated	of net	graduated	of net	graduated	of netbenefit	earnings	benefit	earnings	benefit	earningsSingle     3.15s.Od.

In calculatingnet earnings deductions for income tax and the national insurance contribution (flat-rate plus graduated) have been taken intoaccount.     Unemployment and sickness benefits are not taxable.7.     This scale of graduated short-term benefit would seem a naturaldevelopment of the existing scheme with flat-rate benefits at theirpresent level and the present span of earnings for graauatea pensions.If flat-rate benefits were increase! ana the existing ceiling of weekly earnings were raise a above  18, as wouia probably be necessary in orderto finance the increase, there wouia be room for a rather bettergraauatea benefit with a higher maximum if it were thought desirable.8.     The B.E.C. thinks the present flat-rate benefit should be supplemented by an amount equal to one-quarter of all earnings up to 18 a week, subject to total benefit (flat-rate and graduated) notexceeding two-thirds of earnings.     Although this would provide2.
substantial increases for single men and women, many married men withfamilies already get benefit equal to two-thirds or more of their earnings.     The B.E.C. proposal would give them nothing extra for theirgraduated contributions.     The T.TJ.C. wants higher flat-rate benefitsfirst.     It is unlikely to agree to less than the Labour Party&apos;sobjective, which is about half-pay for the worker on average earnings,and would like a higher proportion for the lower-paid worker.     TheT.U.C. sees the difficulty of combining a substantial rate of benefitwith high dependency allowances, but suggests paying smaller benefit increases for dependants but giving larger family allowances, which aman would draw whether or not he was working.9.     I am convinced that, within the present framework, there arestrong objections to a higher supplement than that suggested inparagraph 4*     On the other hand I du not think it could be put much lower, because those who want graduated unemployment benefit are looking for a higher proportionate benefit for the single man.     Paragraph 6shows that, with the graduated additions suggested, benefits would bemarkedly better than at present even for the single man.     although he would not get much more than one-third of his gross earnings, hewould get almost half his take-home pay, compared with a generallymuch lower proportion at present.     Married men with families would get a high proportion of their net earnings.     If we go for graduatedshort-term benefits, I therefore recommend a graduated supplement ofthree-eighths of weekly earnings between  9 and  18.Duration of benefit10.   Eor how long should the graduated supplement be paid?   The B.E.C.thinks a fairly high rate of benefit would help mobility by making it easier for employers to discharge redundant work people and foremployees to accept redundancy.     The employers therefore want to restrict the period to about three months because they think a high rateof benefit for a longer period might deter people from accepting other work quickly.     The standard period for unemployment benefit, on theother hand, is limited to seven months and may be extended to a possiblemaximum of nineteen months for people with a good contribution and benefit record.     The Labour Party proposes that graduated short-term benefits should be paid for twelve months.     I myself think it wouldbe difficult to pay the graduated supplement for less than the standardperiod of seven months for flat-rate benefit.Should graduation extend to sickness benefit?11.   The B.E.C. opposes the extension of graduation to sickness benefit and, indeed, wants graduated unemployment benefit restricted to people with a good employment record.     The pre-war differentials betweenunemployment and sickness benefits were greatly resented, and the T.U.C.thinks the two earnings-related benefits must be as closely integrated asthe flat-rate benefits are now.12.   The arguments for restricting graduated benefit to the unemployed isthat its main purpose is economic, to encourage mobility of labour;secondly, that sickness benefit claimants normally have a job to returnto;   and thirdly, that over half the total employed population are recovered to some extent by employers&apos; sick pay schemes.     Sickness benefitalso presents a greater administrative problem.     Each year there are over nine million claims to sickness.     A quarter of them are for a week or less, over half for t?1958-59 weeks or less, and over three-quarters for four weeks or less.     Claimants of sickness benefit are not availableto discuss the details of their previous employment, and enquiries by post are bound to cause delay.3.
13.   The argument for including sickness benefit is that unemployment and sickness benefit in the present scheme are designed to serve the samesocial purposes, and that it would give rise to anomalies and seriouspractical difficulties to leave sick people out of graduated benefitsaltogether.     Nearly half of them get no sick pay from their employers,and the proportion is a good deal higher for weekly paid industrial workers.     The sick pay cover that employers give is not always of longduration.14-   If we decide to include sickness benefit, I think that graduatedsickness benefit should not be paid for spells of less than four weeks1sickness nor for the first four weeks of longer spells.     this restriction is essential if the administrative task, which would bevery severe in winter, is to be manageable for employers and mydepartment.     Flat-rate sickness benefit would be payable from the outset and we should encourage employers to provide supplementary sickpay at any rate for short spells of sickness.     It would aooordgenerally with our present policy on sick pay schemes, if employersprovided sick pay to supplement the State flat-rate benefit for the firstmonth of sickness.     Graduated sickness benefit would follow for sixmonths and flat-rate benefit for periods beyond that.15.   The extension of graduation to sickness benefit would undoubtedlylead to claims on behalf of widows.     If graduated sickness benefitwere payable only for a limited period and the flat-rate benefit remained the long-term provision, the introduction of graduated sickness benefit would not itself involve any change in widows&apos; pensions, which are anyhowmore akin to retirement pensions.     Insofar as graduated benefit forunemployment and sickness was a relatively short-term &quot;cushioning&quot;arrangement, it would be natural to extend it to the &quot;widow1sallowance&quot;, which is paid to widows for the first thirteen weeks after their husbands&apos; death.     If graduated unemployment benefit were paid for seven months and graduated sickness benefit for up to six monthsafter the first month, I think we should consider lengthening theperiod for widow&apos;s allowance to six months as part of our improvement of short-term benefits.     The industrial injuries scheme would also beaffected, because injury benefit (not sickness benefit) is paid forup to six months to someone incapacitated by industrial injury ordisease.How to ^relajse. beneflit^to^earrdngsl6.   How should we without delay get reliable figures of recent earningsto which benefit should be related?   The most likely possibility whichhas emerged from discussion with the B.E.C. and T.U.C. is to calculateearnings by reference to the gross figure of earnings for P.A.Y.S. forthe last tax year.     This would give a period long enough to iron outfluctuations in earnings.     Gross earnings in the period could be readily obtained from employers&apos; P.A.Y.E. records, and checked ifnecessary.     Employers would have to be asked to carry forward lastyear&apos;s total to the current record for each employee.17,   Whatever basis were taken for enquiries to employers about earnings,it would certainly be difficult to establish firm figures in a minority of casesj   for instance, where an employee has changed his job (thereare some nine million changes of job a year);   again, about l-g- million people have more than one job at the same time.18.   The figure of total earnings in the base period would be reduced ifthere were weeks of no earnings because of sickness or unemployment.     if no allowance were made for this in converting total earnings for theperiod to a weekly average, men who had been out of work or ill in the base period would have their current benefit reduced.     The T.U.C. thinksit very important to make proper allowance for this, so that benefit is always related to normal earnings.     This would be a considerableadministrative complication which needs more thought.4.
19.   Earnings-related short-term benefits must be supported by-earnings -related contributions, part of which must be paid by the employee.     It would not be practicable to collect earnings-relatedcontributions from the self-employed, who could not be included ina graduated short-term benefits scheme.     They are excluded from the graduated pension scheme for the same reasons;   and they do not inany event qualify for unemployment benefit.   But we could not exclude from the earnings-related benefits those employees who are contracted out *f the State graduated pension scheme.     So we must provide for thepayment of graduated contributions by those contracted out.     Thiswould be a necessary condition for the introduction of graduatedshort-term benefits.     The only solution I can see is that proposedin my memorandum I.N.P, (64) 6.Finance20.   The cost of graduated short-term benefits would depend ondecisions about the range of benefits to be graduated and about thescale and duration of graduation.     The benefit payments would costsomething like 39 million a year (requiring a contribution of about? per cent a side on earnings between  9 and  18 a week) on the assumptions that:-(a) both unemployment and sickness benefit are graduated forthe first seven months (except for the first four weeks of sickness);(b) widow&apos;s allowance, now paid for the first three monthsof widowhood, is also graduated in accordance with the husband&apos;s earnings and is extended to six months;   and(c) the wage-related element of benefit is on the scaleoutlined in paragraph 6 of this paper.Of this cost about  17 million is attributable to unemployment benefit, 16 million to sickness benefit and  6 million to the improvements ofwidow&apos;s allowance.21.   The administrative costs of providing graduated short-term benefits would be comparatively heavy, especially in terms of extra staff.This, and the new system of contributions might need about 500 extrastaff in my department and about 1,300 in the Ministry of Labour,assuming the present level of unemployment, if graduation were confined to unemployment benefit.     About 1,500 more than this would be needed in my department if sickness and widows&apos; benefits were also graduatedon the lines I have suggested.     In the latter case, the total extraadministrative costs falling on the National Insurance Fund would benot far short of  J+ million a year.22.   The total extra costs might therefore be something over  40 million,requiring the contribution increase suggested in paragraph 20.     The1959 Act already provides for a substantial increase in contributions inApril 1965, which, if imposed in full, would produce over  80 million a year.     It looks as if something like this amount will be needed to pay for the growing number of retirement pensions and to enable the scheme as it stands to pay its way.     We may also want to raise benefit ratessometime next year.     If we are to give the older pensioners a worth-whiledifferential, the total increase could not cost much less than  200 million a year.     Together with the extra  40 odd million for short-term benefits,and the quinquennial contribution increase in April 1965, this would makenecessary some very steep contribution increases for higher wage earners.5.
R.W.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance,T&quot;&apos; ft C ft 2 a6th March, 19646.23.   I should be grateful for the Committee&apos;s advice on these questions(l)     Assuming that my proposals about a revised contributionstructure (in Pa.per I.N.P. (64) 6 )    are acceptable, should we commit ourselves to introducing an earnings-relatedsupplement to unemployment benefit on the scale suggestedin paragraph 6?    If so,(2)     For how long should it be paid?(3)     Should sickness be covered as well as unemployment&apos;?(4)     Should widow&apos;s short-term benefit (the 13 weekresettlement allowance) be included and extended to sixmonths?
