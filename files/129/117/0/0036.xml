ANNEX minute BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER TOTHE PRIME minister the NUCLEAR POWER programme in answer -to a Question by Mr. Pentland on the 17th Marchyou told the House that you hoped that an announcement of theGovernment&apos;s conclusions following their study of the report ofthe Powell Committee on the Nuclear Power Programme would be made immediately after the Easter Recess.2.     On 25th March the Economic Policy Committee considered adraft White Paper.    This followed generally the line recommendedby the Powell Committee:   technical and economic assessment ofthe main reactor types had led to the conclusion that the economic advantages to be gained by further development of the presentMagnox system were likely to be smaller than those offered bynew systems;    and that the advanced gas-cooled reactor developedby the Atomic Energy Authority was likely to prove one of themost promising types for the continuance of our nuclear power programme;    for planning purposes a programme of 5.000 MW of nuclear generating capacity should be adopted for commissioningduring the six years 1970-75?   but it was impossible at thisstage to make a firm choice of a particular system becauseinformation had lately become available about American water-moderated reactors which were said to have lower capital costsalthough higher running costs than those of the advanced gas-cooled reactor;    and the next step should be to obtain tendersfrom British industry for reactors of two different systems, the advanced gas-cooled reactor and the water-moderated reactor,the latter to be manufactured under licence to Americandesign.3.     The Economic Policy Committee was troubled by thepossibility that an announcement that we were willing to contemplate reactors of American design would kill the prospects/of our own
of our own nuclear power industry and involve us in writing offthe very substantial sums of money which have been devoted tonuclear power research in the past.    They took the point that if,at this stage, no nuclear system was competitive with the latestconventional power stations the choice should lie between aBritish nuclear system, even if this were more expensive than an american alternative, and conventional power.4.     In the light of these reactions in the Economic PolicyCommittee, I have had further discussions with the Secretary ofState for Education and Science, the Minister of State for education and Science and the Minister of Power.   The Minister of power has been pursuing enquiries and in our discussions has produced the following information:(a) The British industrial consortia which build nuclearplant are themselves interested in water-moderated reactors.One of them intends in any case to offer a tender for such areactor to the Central Electricity Generating Board (C.E.G.B.),and not to offer a tender for an advanced gas-cooled reactorstation.    Another intends to submit a tender for a water-moderatedreactor along with a tender for an advanced gas-cooled reactor,as a specula/tion.(b) The C.E.G.B. intend to invite tenders not merely for oneadvanced gas-cooled reactor but for a second as well in order tobring out any reduction in price which could be obtained bybuying more than one.   This should help towards making tenders for the two systems comparable.(c) Until we have tenders there simply is no basis forjudging the merits of the two systems.(d) It is not&apos;necessarily intended that all the reactorsin the new programme should be of one type:    and if both typeswere running in Britain this might help our export industry,since we could show both types operating./5.   In the light
5.     In the light of this information my colleagues and I have concluded that the line taken in the draft White Paper is theright one, subject to some minor amendments which we have madein the text attached.   None of us regards this text as prejudgingthe eventual decision on the system or systems to be adopted.It is even possible that in the end conventional power may be preferred for the time being, and we are satisfied that the invitations to tender would not rule out this course.6.     I am circulating copies of this minute and of the revised draft White Paper to my colleagues in the Economic PolicyCommittee, and I am also arranging for those members of theCabinet who are not members of this Committee to be consulted.I have asked them to send any comments they may have on thedraft White Paper to me and to the Secretary of State for education and Science, his Minister of State, and the Ministerof Power, not later than noon on Monday, 13th April.    In thisway we intend to have the draft White Paper ready for publication on Wednesday, 15th April, the day after Budget day.So, when you answer your Questions on Tuesday, 14th April, youwill be able to say that the White Paper is to be piiblishedon the following day.R.M.9th April, 1964
ANNEX ii draft   WHITE   paper the SBCQNP..MJCIME-PWM.^PQRAMMEOrders have now been placed for all the nuclear power stations under the present nuclear power programme;    the lastthem was ordered in 1963 and will be commissioned in 1968/69oThis White Paper sets out the programme which lias been adopted for planning purposes for commissioning in the six years1970 to 1975,The Present Nuclear Power programme .     The nuclear power programme &quot;A Programme of nuclear power&quot; (cmnd 93S9), was first prepared in 1955, at a time when there had been a prolonged shortage of coal which was expectedto continue.     Ifprovided for the installation of 1,500-2,000 MW of nuclear capacity by 1965, but emphasised the needfor flexibility to take account of later developments.     In1957, when oil supplies also seemed at risk, the programme wastrebled to provide for the installation of 5,000-6,000 MW of nuclear power by 1965.     This was announced in Parliament inMarch, 1957, and details were given later in the Appendix to&quot;Capital Investment in the Coal, Gas and Electricity Industrie(Cmnd. 132).     By 1960 the strain on our coal supplies hadeased and the prospects of oil supplies also had improved.At the same time there was a substantial reduction in theestimated capital costs of conventional stations from about 55 per kW for those planned in 1955 to about  37 per kW forstations planned in 1960 because of technical advances whichpermitted the use of larger units employing higher steampressures and temperatures;    and these advances have been reflected in lower running costs.     Moreover, the estimatedrelative cost of nuclear power had risen since 1955, not
because of any change in technical assessment, but because ofthe increased emphasis on the importance of earning   a properrate of return on the capital investment, the rise in interest rates and the reduction in the credits for plutonium.     As aresult it appeared that nuclear power would not compete in costs with conventional power as early as had been expected.The period of the programme was extended to provide for theconstruction of about 5,000 MW by 1968.     This was announced in &quot;The Nuclear Power Programme&quot; (Cmnd. 1083, June, i960).The second part of Wylfa, the last station under the firstprogramme, is now expected to be completed in 1969.3.     There are nine commercial stations in the present pro-gramme, all of the Magnox type initially developed by the atomic Energy Authority at Calder Hall,     They use carbondioxide gas as coolant, graphite as moderator and naturaluranium as fuel.     The first two, Bradwell and Berkeley, werecommissioned in 1962 and Hunterston has now begun to supplypower to the Grid.     Another two, Hinkley Point andTrawsfynydd, are nearing completion;    and four more are under construction.     Although these stations will produce power ata higher cost than was originally expected, the generation of nuclear power, from the technical standpoint, has achieved allthat was expected of it.     Bradwell and Berkeley made a valuable contribution to electricity supplies during the diffi&apos;cult period of the 1962/63 winter and the estimates of capital costs and total generating costs of the later stations showmarked reductions;    thus whereas Berkeley and Bradwell cost about  180 per kW, Wylfa, which will be commissioned in 1968and 1969, is estimated to cost about  100 per kW.     Againstthe relatively high capital cost of nuclear power must be setrunning costs which are substantially below those forconventional stationsa-2-CONF1DENT5AL
THE SECOND PROGRAMMETypes of Reactorh.     When the British nuclear power programme was launched in 1955j the Magnox reactor system, developed in the UnitedKingdom and using natural (unenriched) uranium as fuel, wasin advance of other systems.     Now there is a wider choice forthe second programme, because several new types of reactor,most of which use enriched uranium fuels, have been intensivelydeveloped in this country and abroad.     The Central electricity generating Board and the Atomic Energy Authority have made ajoint technical and economic assessment of the main reactortypes, namely developments of the Magnox system, the CANDU&apos;&apos;heavy water system, the American Boiling Water Reactor (B.W.R.)and other water systems, and the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor(A.G.R.),     Their conclusion is that the economic advantages to be gained by the further development of the present Magnoxsystem are likely, in the circumstances now prevailing in theUnited Kingdom, to he smaller than those offered by new systems.Of the rest, the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor developed by the atomic Energy Authority from the same concept as the Magnoxreactor is accepted as one of the most promising for thecontinuance of the British nuclear power programme.     Recently,however, information has been received that some American watermoderated reactors are said to have lower capital costs, althoughhigher running costs, than those of the A.G.R., and thesereactors warrant further consideration before a firm choice ismade.     The emergence of these new types of reactors doesnot mean that the Magnox type should be regarded as obsolete;it is indeed the best-proved reactor for large stations andin some conditions it would still be the most appropriate typeavailable,Canadian Deuterium Uranium Reactor
5.      The information about available reactor systems hasbeen examined by the Government with the Atomic energy authority and the electricity supply industry.     As a result,the Government are satisfied that it is right to continue witha substantial nuclear power programme, and that the Britishline of development has an important part to play in thise6-,     The Central Electricity Generating Board will issue an enquiry for tenders for an Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor station,,They will also be ready to consider tenders from Britishindustry for water-moderated reactor systems of provecL Assign?provided that full supporting evidence is submitted withthe tenders and that requirements of safety and performancecomparable with those of the A.G,R. are met.     They will ensure that these tenders are judged on a comparable basis,7o      The Government will review with the supply industry andthe Atomic Energy Authority the results of this enquiry inorder to decide the type or types of reactor to be builtaThis procedure will allow time for the further considerationwithout which a firm choice of reactor cannot properly bemade;    at the same time it will permit orders for new stations to be placed promptly enough to ensure the continuity of the nuclear power programme and the flow of work to the manu-facturing industries.Size of Programme8,     The unit cost of electricity depends on the characteristics of the load on the generating system, the location of power stations, the cost of construction;, the assumed life of thestation and the cost of different kinds of fuel, in addition toother costs of operation,,      Comparisons of the costs ofbuilding alternative types of stations using different methodsof electricity generation must be based on particular economic-k-
and technical assumptions, and may convey no true indication of the burden of costs of different methods of generation onthe whole generating system.     There are many uncertaintiesabout both the economic and technical assumptions used, butdetailed studies show that nuclear power is likely to have aneconomic place in the British electricity system by the early1970&apos;s and suggest that, thereafter, it will become cheaperthan conventional power for the generation of base load.9e     Nuclear power stations at present have a heavy capital cost, but their running costs are low.     Coal and oil-firedplants have lower capital costs, but higher running costs.The economics of both types of plant benefit from intensiverunning, but this is particularly important with nuclear power.     The nuclear stations to be commissioned during1970-1975 will be in use at least until the 1990&apos;s.Together with the Magnox stations of the first nuclear pro-gramme they will form a significant portion of the nation&apos;sgenerating capacity but should not exceed base-load require-ments for the expected electricity demand.     The onlyqualification is that, if new nuclear power stations after1975 became so cheap in capital and running costs that thepurchase of an extremely large proportion were justified,pre-1 975 stations of all types would be displaced to lessintensive service because of the lower running costs of thenew power stations.10.    Because of the heavy capital cost of nuclear power andthe many calls on the country&apos;s scarce capital resources,it is necessary to steer a course between committing thecountry to an excessive immediate burden of capital costs andfailing to take advantage of the prospective low total costs of nuclear power.      It is also necessary to ensure that the pro-gramme is large enough to provide adequate experience and to sustain facilities for rapid expansion in later years.
11,    In the light of the technical and. economic assessmentsit has &quot;been decided, in agreement with the authorities concerned, that for planning purposes a programme of 5,000 MWof nuclear generating capacity should &quot;be adopted in Englandand Wales for commissioning during the six years 1970-75.The programme is intended to he flexible and it will be reviewed at regular intervals in the light of later informa-tion.     The question of a further nuclear station in scotland will be considered in these reviews.     Reactors to be installedin the later stations of the programme may be larger thanthose in the earlier stations to enable advantage to be taken of advances in technology and economies of scale.C.9.h..6k
