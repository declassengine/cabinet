SICiRiT343MAJOR^DSFSNCB, WORKS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for defence the Cabinet will be taking papers on Defence Building.I regret that I am unable to be present at the discussion,2.      I think it right, however, to call attention to the fact thatthere are pol political as well as military implications in following the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposal for a further attack on the defencebuilding programme.   We have just had a debate which has coveredsome aspects of these problems.   Despite all my efforts, theheadline we have earned lias been &quot;The Army in Verminous Slums&quot;,This headline is unfair and unjust, but it reflects the fact that theEstimates  Committee, like our own supporters, regard ourprovision for soldiers&apos; accommodation as inadequate.3,      I have made great efforts to economise on building by cutting back the requirement wherever possible.   Recently we agreed on a very controversial decision to limit the number of families in Aden to not much more than half the entitlement.It may well be that we shall have to limit the degree of accompaniedservice in other theatres.   In Aden and Bahrein alone the savingsrepresented a figure of some  15. 5 million up to the end of1968-69.4,      The corollary of cuts of this nature is surely that we donot restrict accommodation at home,   Recently we had our plans for married quarters cut from  50. 25 million to  47 million over the three year period 1964-65 to 1966-67. I accepted thisregretfully, and we have been much attacked for it.   It means that we shall be unable to meet our obligations until a much later date than I had hoped and that the Royal Navy will continue to lagbehind the other two Services,   The failure to grapple with theprovision of married quarters is among the most importanthandicaps to sustaining volunteer forces.   Now, and against this background, at a time when our party is growing openly critical of our performance, I am asked to accept a further restriction on our plans, which can only have the effect of curtailing thebarrack rebuilding programme as well.   I say frankly to myCOPY NO.8th May. 1964CABINET
colleagues that, if this cut is accepted, our supporters will notbe turning their guns upon the enemy, and it is a waste of time myasking them to do so.   They will be turning their guns upon theirown front bench.   We shall be accused on all sides of neglectingconventional requirements in general, and slumping on the well-being of fee troops in particular.   Ail this to achieve a cut ofone-tenth of 1 per cent in the total load on the constructionindus tries.5.       I do not, however, despite these considerations, askat this stage for a final decision rejecting the Chief Secretary!sproposals.   I do ask that no decision to endorse his proposals may be taken in my absence, in isolation from the rest of thedefence budget, and without weighing it carefully against otherbuilding plans, including building programmes sponsored by someof my colleagues.   In particular, I would point out that we are currently engaged on the annual forward costing exercise.   If Iwere to ask the Treasury for increased provision for anything atthis stage, I should be told immediately that my duty was to wait for the completion of that exercise.   I am clear that thesame argument must be applied to the Treasury arguments for a cut in the programme.to    ministry of Defence, S. W. 18th May, 1964-2-SECRET
