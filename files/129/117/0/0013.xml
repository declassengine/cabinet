SERVICES42.     The supply of goods is dealt with, so far as monopolies areconcerned, by the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry andControl) Act, 1948, and, so far as restrictive practices are concernetby the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956.    Apart from certain minor exceptions neither of these Acts applies to services.43.    In a modern economy the sector concerned with the supply of services is becoming increasingly important.    Not enough is yet known, however, about the operation of restrictive practices in thesupply of services to make it possible to say whether it would be appropriate to bring services within the scope of the restrictive practices legislation.    The Government propose to adopt the samepragmatic approach which was applied to goods in 1948.    They will therefore seek authority for the Monopolies Commission to makeinquiries in the field of commercial services (in particular servicesrelating to goods) at the request of the Government where the latterconsider this to be necessary in the public interest.    It will then rest with the Government, subject to the approval of Parliament, to take appropriate action.
