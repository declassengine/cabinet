M.COPY NO.Treasury Chambers, S. W.I..8th May, 1964
PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN 1965-66;DISCUSSION In&quot;tHE^SCONQMIC POIj^XiiQMMITTEENote by the Secretaries of the Economic Policy committee at their meeting on the 8th May, 1964 the Economic PolicyCommittee considered the memorandum by the Chief Secretary whichhas been circulated to the Cabinet as C. P. (64) 96.    The centralrecommendation of that memorandum is that planned public service investment in 1965-66 ought to be cut from the  1,535 million nowforecast to  1,440 million;  and towards this he makes proposalsamounting to  58 million.    He leaves university investment on one side for the purposes of his paper.    The reasons why the chief secretary has made his recommendations are summarised inparagraphs 4-6 of his paper.Discussion in the Committee of the implications of therecommendation showed that the following main issues arise on whichrulings by the Cabinet are required as the next step:(a) Should the total of approvals of public authorities&apos; housing in England and Wales in 1964 be restricted to 116, 000against the 125,000 which is now forecast (thus saving 13 million in 1965-66)?The main consideration in favour of so doing is the need to reduce thehousing programme, as the greatest single part of the public service investment programme, if there is to be sufficient relief of the expected overload on the construction industries in 1965-66,and the consequent inflationary pressures;  the greater part of housing invest-ment being private enterprise, and therefore uncontrolled, restrictionsmust fall on the public sector.The main opposing considerations are that, since the areas ofthe country to which the Government are giving priority must be excluded, the proposed restriction would entail severe reduction of thepublic housing programmes elsewhere and would fall largely on theprovision for special needs, such as slum clearance and old people&apos;housing, for which private enterprise building does not normally caterjthe      time taken to complete houses is still falling;  and restriction of the public housing programme would be likely to be a severe setbackto the introduction of industrialised building methods, since theGovernment have so far concentrated on facilitating the introductionof these methods for housing, persuading local authorities and thebuilding industry that there is a firm prospect of sustained demandsuch as these methods require.(b) Should the Scottish housing programme be restricted towhat it was as forecast in March, since whenthe forecasthas risen sharply?   (The proposal is that the expenditureof  96 million now forecast for 1965-66 should be reducedby  18 million to   78 million.)The main consideration in favour of doing so is again the need to avoid inflationary strain on the construction industries, coupled withthe dominant position of public authorities&apos; housing in public service investment,-1-
The main points on the other side are that the Scottish housing programme is heavily concentrated in Central Scotland, to which theGovernment are giving priority; private enterprise housing inScotland is relatively minor; and there is no evidence o  overstrainon the contruction industries in Central Scotland,(c) Should the Ministry of Health programme for hospitals and local health and welfare be reduced?   (The chief secretary&apos;s paper (paragraph 13) proposes a reductionof  2. 75 million.)The Minister of Health has pointed out that he controls the phasing of work under the hospital programme by reference to themoney allocated to it.   Accordingly, he considers that his programme is penalised if a reduction is imposed upon it because of generalstrain on resources while other programmes are not equally tightlycontrolled.(.&quot;.) Should the compromise solution to the problem of the1965 programme for university building, as set out inthe Home Secretary&apos;s memorandum C.P(64) 98 be adopted?The Home Secretary reports in his paper that his committee decided to put forward the compromise to the Cabinet.   Neither theChief Secretary nor the Secretary of State for Education and Scienceare finally committed to it.   The Chief Secretary has reserved hisposition pending the outcome of the Cabinet!s consideration of thecomplete field of public service investment.   The Secretary of state has undertaken to accept the compromise, with the approval of theCabinet, if the Chief Secretary does so.(Signed)Cabinet Office, S. 77.18th May, 1964-2-P,,S..
