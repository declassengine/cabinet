SOUTH EAST ENGLANDForeword1. Today, 18 million people-thirty-five out of every hundred in GreatBritain live in South East England. In the last thirty years the populationof the area has gone up by 3 million. During the next twenty years it islikely to increase by another 3J million, mostly by the process of natural growth. Such a rate of increase creates major problems of land, housing,employment and transport. Their solution is of crucial importance, not only for the very large numbers of people who live and work in the South East,but for the whole country. Much of our national prosperity depends on the prosperity of South East England and the distribution of its population and employment must, therefore, be planned so as to promote its maximum efficiency. At the same time a balance must be kept between the growth. of the South East and the needs of other parts of the country.2. The Government decided in 1961 to assess the land requirements ofthe whole South East over the next 20 years, and to seek solutions forLpndon&apos;s problems over a wide front. The growth of population andemployment in Greater London and the area it dominates had been muchgreater than could have been predicted when the post-war plans wereprepared. The birth-rate had risen and was rising fast and the continuingdecline in the average size of households meant that more homes were needed for the same number of people. London was in danger of choking.Much more land is required for its current needs, and for the future needsij of the whole South East.3. The outcome of this decision by the Government is &quot;The SouthEast Study &quot;*, a report by officials, published at the same time as this white paper, with which it should be read.  The Study covers the area south easti of a line from the Wash to Dorset.  It is a comprehensive examination of1 the housing and land use problems of Greater London and the South EastI during the period up to 1981.Expected Population Growth4. The Study finds that nearly 2\ million of the expected 3^. million population increase in the South East over the period 1961-1981 will bej excess of births over deaths, and just over one million net inward migrationI from other parts of Great Britain, both for employment and for retirement,I and from overseas. Further growth probably at a higher rate so far asj natural increase is concerned is likely after 1981.I 5. The Government have already shown by their development plans forI North East England and Central Scotland their determination to build upI the prosperity of other parts of the country. They are satisfied that the) Study takes full account of this policy. They accept the Study as a reasonable .I assessment of the nature and scale of the South East&apos;s population problem.Population forecasts over a 20-year period are, inevitably, subject to aj considerable margin of error and must, therefore, frequently be reviewed.I This will be done; and the sample census already announced for 1966 isI being devised with this in mind. Meanwhile the Government are satisfied! that these population estimates provide a realistic basis for planning to meetI future land needs.I   * Published by HMSO; price
The Broad Strategy6. The Study&apos;s proposals. Much of the population growth in the SouthEast will be dealt with through the release of land by local planning authori-ties, followed by development, in the ordinary way. The amount of landallocated will have to be increased considerably in order to make proper provision for the expected growth. The Study suggests that such additionalallocations should provide for 2-2  million more people.7. But the central problem of the South East is disproportionate growth of population and employment in and around London. The Study examinesthree main approaches to this problem.8. One possibility is to have no plan at all, in the hope that the situation would be self-correcting. This would mean that no attempt was made to influence the future pattern of growth in the South East. Experience sincethe war, however, shows that, if things were left to take their course, too much of the population would continue to concentrate on London and thering around it, thus creating ever more intractable problems of housing and road and rail transport. Such an approach would lead to increasing over-crowding and congestion in London, and to extreme pressure on the metro-politan green belt.9. A second possibility would be to go on as at present. This wouldmean continuing with new towns and town expansions, of a moderate size,designed simply to provide accommodation for London&apos;s overspill population.This would indeed meet a pressing need, but would fail to prevent its recur-rence. It would not solve the basic problem.. 10. The Study suggests instead a third approach which should, in thecourse of time, alter the distribution of population growth in the South East,and thus relieve the pressure on London and the surrounding countryside.This would be done through a fresh and much larger programme of new and expanded towns, the individual expansion schemes being on a biggerscale than those in the current programme. They would be centred on placeswell away from London.11. For many years now the number of people living in the Londonconurbation has been falling, although the number of jobs has been rising.London, however, has a high birthrate and there will be many new house-holds with a consequent increase in the demand for houses. But, although many more houses will be needed for Londoners, there is little undevelopedhousing land left in the conurbation and, with the need to redevelop to modern standards, there will have to be an overspill of about one million during the Study period.12.. This overspill is included in the 3^ million net population growth of the South East, all of which will have to be accommodated outside theLondon conurbation. The pattern of distribution over the next 20 yearscontemplated by the authors of the Study therefore is:(i) The population of the London conurbation would by the end ofthe period be at about its present level approximately 8 million..;; (ii); Outside London,., land for housing an additional 2-2\ million people would be provided by allocations in the development plans of thelocal planning authorities.
(iii) There would be a second generation of new and expanded townsplanned on a large scale, to accommodate 1-1  million people, wellaway from London. -   *- 13. The Government&apos;s initial conclusions,. The Government agree thatthe magnitude of the task in the South East calls for further initiatives. Tosecure a better distribution of the inevitable growth, and to reduce thedominance of London, a radical change in the pattern of development isrequired. In the Governments view, this can best be achieved if some ofthe population and employment increases which would otherwise take place! j in London and the congested metropolitan region are brought about in11 alternative centres of growth.11 14. The Government, while not departing from their policy of channellingI economic growth from the South East to other parts of the country whereverI j possible, accept the basic objectives of the Study.  Accordingly, they acceptI I the need for new and expanded towns to accommodate 1-1^.- million people,in ways which would provide effective relief for the pressures on London.I Both private and public enterprise should contribute towards this programme.15. The processes necessary to bring about this development will takei 1 some years: in the meantime development of Central Scotland and NorthII East England, to which the Government have given priority in public invest-&apos;ment, will be going ahead.16. The consequences rf the Governmenfs initial conclusions.   Accept-.j anqe of the broad objectives will have important implications for policy ina number of related fields.  These fall into three categories :I       (i) the pattern of development in the South East;(ii) problems of employment growth;(iii) implications for the country as a whole.The Pattern of Development17. Development plans. In the South East itself, the essence of theproblem is the provision of more land. Local planning authorities will need to bring the land allocations in their development plans into line with up-to-date population estimates, and the Study will enable them to do so. Bythis means it should be possible to make early provision for some two-thirds of the population growth expected in the South East. This is a matter towhich the Government attach the greatest importance. Developers whethermeeting private or public needs-must be assured of a long forward supplyof land for development..18. Confidence in the supply of land and the certainty of long termination building programmes will contribute towards the development of new build-ing techniques which make better use of skilled labour.  This will help towards greater productivity in the construction industry, which the NationalI Building Agency is designed to promote, and which is essential for the new,j higher programme of building.
19. Machinery for planned expansion. In the planned expansion schemes it will be necessary to keep a close control over the provision ofland for two reasons. The first is to enable the whole programme to be phased correctly. The second is to ensure that land is brought forward as itis required for development, whether by private enterprise or public agencies.Where the development takes the form of new towns, broadly satisfactorymachinery already exists. The Government intend to work out similar arrangements for carrying through major town expansion schemes in partner-ship with the local authorities, and they envisage that the land needed forthese schemes should be acquired as necessary in advance of needs.20. The green belt. The Study draws attention to the heavy pressures on the green belt around London. The Government have already undertaken to maintain the approved metropolitan green belt and to make substantialadditions to it, and they have no intention of departing from this policy.They will not permit any general extension of the built-up area of London,and they intend that the approved green belt should be substantially extended and strengthened by the addition of hundreds of square miles of open country. They consider nevertheless that, in their search for more housingland, the local planning authorities should consider the possibilities offered by such land as there is in the green belt which in itself contributes little of value to the purpose of the belt. This could only be very small in relationto the whole but such as there is ought to be considered. The local planning authorities must also have the opportunity to re-examine, in the light of thelatest estimates of population growth, the proposals they have made for extending the green belt. The Minister of Housing and Local government does not therefore propose to approve these in their present form.21. Agricultural land. The Government endorse the view expressed inthe Study that high quality agricultural land should not be taken for urban development wherever there is a practical alternative.22. Railways. There is little likelihood of serious conflict between british railways&apos; plans and the general pattern of future development outlined inthe Study. Where passenger closure proposals are concerned, the Govern-ment, before reaching decisions, will in each case take full account of thepossible developments put forward in the Study. In particular, they will consider whether the possibilities of future development make it desirablethat a line should remain available for future use if required.23. The Channel Tunnel. The Government have recently announced their agreement in principle to the construction of a Channel Tunnel. In reachingthis decision they satisfied themselves that the clear national economic advan-tage which, given certain conditions, is to be expected from the completionof this project would be reinforced by its benefits to other parts of thecountry than the South East. The plans for reshaping the railway system to meet future demands will naturally include any proper through links between the tunnel terminal and other parts of the country. In this way thebenefits of improved communications with the Continent will be spread far beyond the area of the terminal itself and indeed far beyond the South East.24. Consultation. The Study as a whole, and the particular proposals contained in it, raise many important issues. Public opinion within and outside the South East must have an opportunity to express itself before
final decisions are taken. The Minister of Housing and Local Governmentwill now consult all the local planning authorities affected and any other local authorities who may be concerned. They will be invited to give then-views as soon as possible, and discussions will be arranged with them.Problems of Employment Growth25. Present position. Employment has been growing faster in theSouth East than in any other part of the country. A great part of theemployment growth has been in service industries, such as in commerce,building, distribution, transport and other forms of employment closelytied to the populations they serve. There is, however, tight control overexpansions of manufacturing industry, particularly in London, and theSouth East has been an important source of industry for the development districts.26. Expansion schemes. On present indications there will certainly bejobs enough for the increased population of the South East. The problem is essentially one of distribution. Enough employment will be required inthe right places and at the right time for the new expansion schemes whichare intended to relieve the pressures on London. This will not be an easymatter. The Study suggests various possible sources of employment.However, the provision of employment for these schemes will not beallowed to detract from the effort to develop other parts of the country.In particular, there will continue to be a rigorous examination of individual firms&apos; proposals for industrial expansion in the South East.27. Offices. It will be of particular importance for the implementation of the Governmenfs decisions on the Study to secure much more de-centralisation of offices from London and this should be an importantsource of employment for some of the expansion schemes.28. Office building in London has been meeting a strong economicdemand, and commercial growth, just like industrial growth, contributesto prosperity. Further, much of the commercial activity in London isI complex and interlinked. The rapid growth of office employment has,I however, caused big housing and transport problems over a wide area.I The Government have concentrated on improving planning control andi providing alternative centres. They have set up the Location of Officesi Bureau to encourage and help firms to leave London, and on the basis\ of the recommendations made by Sir Gilbert Flemming they are pressing: ahead with more decentralisation of Government work.29. Travel to work in London. The London White Paper* showed howI growth in office employment in London was threatening to exhaust thej capacity of the suburban railway lines to carry more workers into Centralj London. British Railways have therefore been making a fresh examinationI of their services. The preliminary results show that technically their present :- network could cater for many more commuters, though very considerable! changes in the pattern of railway services would be involved. The Victoriai Line, which was approved by the Government in 1962 and is now under construction, will be an important supplement to London Transportsj services but further additions to their network may be needed.   British* London-Employment:  Housing:  Land (Cmnd. 1952).7
Railways and London Transport are developing detailed proposals toincrease their capacity. The Government will work with them and withthe local authorities concerned to evolve, in the light of the results ofthe London Traffic Survey, a comprehensive transport plan for London.This must take full account of the plans for new housing and of thefinancial implications.   : 1        iImplications for the Country as a whole30. As the Study makes plain, population pressures in the South Eastare such that planning must begin now even though the greater part ofthe development in the expansion schemes cannot take place until the1970&apos;s. By determining the extent and location of public investment andindustrial building, and by phasing the release of land for development in expansion schemes, the Government will ensure that the proper develop-ment of the South East is carried out without prejudicing growth in otherparts of the country. Their machinery for keeping under examinationpolicies which have the most direct bearing on regional development will assist in this. They will modify the existing policies if this should benecessary.31. The Government believe that the process of regional planning can contribute greatly to the well-being and prosperity of the country as awhole. They have already published programmes, which are now being implemented, for Central Scotland and the North East. Studies of other regions are being prepared. In this way the special needs of individualregions can be identified and a proper national balance achieved and maintained. The problems of the South East are of a different kind fromthose of most other regions, but it is clearly in the national interest thatthey should be dealt with effectively ; the Government intend to ensurethat this is done.Printed in England and published by her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office(31434) Wt.   -    75, 100  2/64 St.S.
