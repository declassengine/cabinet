Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1964CP. (64) 64 Copy No.    5110th March, 1964CABINETCOMPENSATION FOR VICTIMS OF CRIMES OF VIOLENCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department the Cabinet decided on 15th October, 1963 (C.C. (63) 60th Conclusions, 6),that arrangements for the payment of compensation to the victims of crimes of violence should be introduced initially in the form of a non-statutory ex gratiascheme and invited me, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, toarrange for the preparation of a White Paper, describing the principles of thescheme and the arrangements for its administration.2. The arrangements for compensation have since been discussed at meetingsof Ministers and officials of the Departments principally concerned. A draft white paper approved at a meeting of the Home Affairs Committee on 6th March isattached to this memorandum.3. The draft White Paper proposes (in paragraph 9) the establishment of aVictims of Crimes of Violence Compensation Board, composed of independentpersons with legal experience, who would award compensation assessed on thebasis of common law damages. In order to keep the awards within reasonable limits, the rate of loss of earnings (and, where appropriate, of earning capacity)that the Board could take into account would not exceed twice the average ofindustrial earnings at the time the injury was sustained (see paragraph 22).4. The procedure, outlined in paragraphs 23-28 of the draft White Paper,for determining applications for compensation is based on two principles:(a) All the decisions should be taken initially by one member of the Board,after sifting by the Board&apos;s staff with the aid of reports from thepolice; and(b) where the applicant is dissatisfied with the decision of that member heshould be allowed a judicial hearing by three other members of theBoard, who would determine the application solely in the light of theevidence brought out at the hearing (and therefore would not have access to information not disclosed to the applicant).5. I seek my colleagues&apos; agreement to the publication and presentation of theWhite Paper at the earliest possible moment, with a view to obtainingParliamentary approval to the institution of a scheme of compensation as set outin the White Paper.H.

COMPENSATION FOR VICTIMS OF CRIMES OFVIOLENCEIntroductioni 1. This White Paper sets out the arrangements which the government propose to make for compensating viotims of crimes of violence.2. The increase in crime in recent years and the new .measures taken todeal with offenders have focused attention also on the victims of crime.As was said in the White Paper &quot;Penal Practice ia a Changing Society&quot;*,which was presented to Parliament in February 1959:  &quot; The assumption that the claims of the victim are sufficiently satisfiedif the offender is punished by society becomes less persuasive as society in its dealings with offenders increasingly emphasises the reformativeaspects of punishment. Indeed in the public mind the interests of the offender may not infrequently seem to be placed before those of hisvictim.This is certainly not the correct emphasis. . . .&quot;The White Paper announced that the Government had decided to set up an official working party to examine the question of compensating victims of crimes of violence and see whether, if the principle were accepted, a workable scheme could be devised.3. The official working party, whose report was embodied in a white paper &quot; Compensation for Victims of Crimes of Violence &quot;t, presented, toParliament in June 1961, considered two different types of scheme. In thefirst, which would be broadly similar to the Industrial Injuries Scheme, weeklypayments would be made to persons who suffered injuries as a -result tof acrime of violence, and, in addition, payments might be made to dependants ofpersons killed. The alternative was a &quot; court scheme &quot; in which the victimof a crime of violence, or the dependant of a deceased victim, could make a claim against the Home Secretary substantially similar to the claim for damages which he could, under the existing law, make against the aggressor ;entitlement to compensation, which would take the form of a lump sum,would be decided by the courts unless a settlement were reached out of court; and the Home Secretary would have the right to recover from the aggressor as much as possible of any compensation awarded to the victim.4. The working party&apos;s report was published, as was explained in thePreface to the White Paper, &quot; with a view to eliciting further opinions &quot;. Itstimulated considerable public discussion of the subject. In particular, reportsrecommending State compensation schemes were prepared and published bya Committee of the Conservative Party and by a Committee of &quot; Justice&quot;,.The Government have fully considered these and other reports and memo-randa, and some of the suggestions they contained have been embodied inthe proposals set out in this White Paper.* Cmnd. 645.t Cmnd. 1406.
5. Virtually all the public comment since the appearance of the official working party&apos;s report has accepted, on the one hand, that some compen-sation should be available for the victims of crime and, on the other hand,that compensation can justifiably be restricted to the victims of crimes of violence. The various types of compensation scheme which have beenadvocated all resemble one or other of the two schemes considered by theworking party, and the general supposition has been that the State should accept some liability for the victim&apos;s injuries. But in a debate in the Houseof Lords on 5th December 1962 several speakers proposed that compensa-tion should be payable ex gratia, rather than as of right.The Governmenfs proposals. The Government accept the principle that the victims of crimes of violence should be eligible for some compensation for personal injury atthe public expense and propose to make arrangements for this purpose assoon as possible. In considering what these arrangements should be, it isimportant to bear in mind that a State compensation scheme of this kindwill be a new departure. Until the coming into force on 1st January 1964of the New Zealand Criminal Injuries Compensation Act no other countryin the world had a scheme of compensation of the type that has been dis-cussed in this country during the past few years. There is thus virtually noprevious experience on which to draw in assessing how a compensation scheme would work. The number of crimes of violence reported to thepolice is known; many of these, however, are not the brutal assaults onstrangers that should certainly lead to compensation, but arise out ofbrawls or family disputes, where the &quot; victim &quot; may have been as much to blame as the aggressor. It is impossible to forecast with any assurance,therefore, how many persons would apply for compensation, if there were a scheme, or in how many of these cases a payment out of public funds would be justified. There must certainly be safeguards to ensure that, sofar as possible, public money is not wasted on fraudulent or unmeritedapplications.7. For these reasons, the Government consider it best to start with aflexible scheme which can be altered in the light of experience. This white paper therefore proposes an experimental and non-statutory scheme.8. Compensation will be paid ex gratia. The Government do not accept that the State is liable for injuries caused to people by the acts of others.The public does, however, feel a sense of responsibility for and sympathy with the innocent victim, and it is right that this feeling should find practicalexpression in the provision of compensation on behalf of the community.Administration of the scheme. The compensation scheme will be administered by a body to be known as the Victims of Crimes of Violence Compensation Board. TheChairman will be a person of wide legal experience, and the members ofthe Board will also be legally qualified. It is proposed to start with a Boardof five members, in addition to the Chairman; additional members can beappointed later, if it is found that the volume of applications for compensa-tion is too great for the original Board to handle expeditiously; and it willnot be obligatory for more than three members of the Board to be present at the hearing of an application (see paragraphs 25-27 below). appointments to the Board will be made by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State
for Scotland, after consultation with the Lord Chancellor. The Board willbe assisted by the appropriate staff, who will sift applications for compensa-tion, make preliminary enquiries and deal with correspondence (see para-graphs 23 and 24 below).10. The Board will be provided with money through a Grant-in-Aidout of which payments will be made to applicants for compensation wherethe Board are satisfied, in accordance with the principles set out below,that compensation is justified. Their expenditure will fall on the Votes of theHome Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department.11. The Board will be based on London; and they will hold hearingsin London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and elsewhere as necessary.12. The Board will be entirely responsible for deciding what compensa-tion should be paid in individual cases and their decisions will not be subjectto appeal or to Ministerial review. They will, however, act in accordancewith the principles and procedure outlined in this White Paper, if approvedby Parliament. The general working of the scheme will be kept underreview by the Government, and the Board will submit to the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland an annual report on theoperation of the scheme, together with their accounts. The report and accounts will be open to debate in Parliament.Scope of Compensation Scheme13. Personal injury may arise from a great variety of offences, includingcrimes against property as well as crimes against the person. It is not,therefore, proposed to specify a comprehensive list of crimes, the victims of which may apply for compensation. Broadly speaking, however, appli-cations are likely to arise either out of offences against the person, such asmurder, manslaughter, assault and sexual offences; from offences againstproperty accompanied by personal violence principally robbery ; or frompersonal injuries due to malicious damage to property, including arson.The scheme will be limited to injuries arising from offences committed inGreat Britain or committed on British vessels or aircraft and triable inthis country.14. Compensation will be payable whether or not the offender has beenbrought to justice. But it will be necessary, for practical reasons, to exclude offences occurring before the commencement of the scheme.Compensation will be payable only where there has been an appreciabledegree of injury : that is to say, an injury giving rise to at least three weeks&apos;loss of earnings or, alternatively, an injury for which not less than  50compensation would be awarded. Thus the Board will entertain applica-tions only in those cases where:  (a) there has been an appreciable degree of injury (as defined above)directly attributable either to a criminal offence involving the useof force or to an attempt by the victim, acting as a member of thepublic, to apprehend a criminal;(b) the circumstances of the injury have been reported to the policewithout delay or have been the subject of criminal proceedings inthe courts;(c) the injury was incurred after the commencement of the scheme; and(d) the applicant is prepared to submit to such medical examinationas the Board may require.
15. The Board will also, in assessing the amount of compensation inaccordance with the principles set out in paragraph 22 below, take accountof any share of responsibility, whether because of provocation or otherwise,which in their opinion attaches to the victim of the crime.16. The Board will scrutinise with particular care all applications inrespect of sexual offences or other offences arising out of a sexual relation-ship, in order to determine whether there was any responsibility, either because of provocation or otherwise, on the part of the victim (see para-graph 15 above), and they will especially have regard to any delay thathas occurred in submitting the application. Provided, however, that thecircumstances have been immediately reported to the police, the Board will consider applications for compensation arising out of rape and sexualassaults, both in respect of pain, suffering and shock and in respect of lossof earnings due to pregnancy resulting from rape. Compensation will notbe payable for the maintenance of any child born as a result of a sexualoffence.17. Offences committed against a member of the offender^ householdliving with him at the time will be excluded altogether, in view of thedifficulty in establishing the facts and ensuring that the compensation doesnot benefit the offender.18. Motoring offences will also be excluded from the scheme, except where the motor vehicle has been used as a weapon i.e. in a deliberateattempt to run the victim down. Injuries caused by identified vehicles are recovered by insurance arrangements, and where the vehicle has not been identified it is usually very difficult to prove that an offence has occurred.Basis of Compensation19. Compensation will take the form of a lump sum payment, ratherthan a periodical pension. It may, however, sometimes be necessary for more than one payment to be made for example, where only a provisionalmedical assessment can be given in the first instance.20. The Board will have discretion to make special arrangements forthe administration of any sum payable to an infant.21. Where the injury has proved fatal, the widow or dependants of theinjured person will be eligible for an award of compensation.22. Compensation will be assessed on the basis of common law damages,except that: (a) the rate of loss of earnings (and, where appropriate, of earning capacity) to be taken into account will not exceed twice the average(according to the age and sex of the victim) of industrial earningsat the time that the injury was sustained ;(&amp;) there will be no element comparable to exemplary or punitivedamages ; and(c) there will be no award for loss of expectation of happiness.In the case of a fatal injury, any compensation awarded to the widow ordependants will be assessed on the same principles as in a claim under theFatal Accidents Acts. Where applicable, compensation will be reduced bythe;amount of any social security benefits received, as a result of the injury ordeath, by the person to whom the award is made.
Procedure for determining applications23. Every application will be made in writing, as soon as possible afterthe event, to the Board (who will draw up a suitable form for the convenience of applicants).24. Applications will be sifted initially by the Board&apos;s staff who will,where necessary, seek further information as to the relevant circumstances.25. The initial decision whether the application should be allowed (and,if so, what amount of compensation should be offered), or should be rejected as having no merits (for example, because preliminary investigationsuggests that the injury is not serious or is not within the scope of thescheme, or that the applicant was to blame or that the application isfraudulent), will be taken by one member of the Board and communicatedto the applicant. If the applicant is not satisfied with that decision, whetherbecause no compensation is offered or because he considers the amountoffered to be inadequate, he will be entitled to a hearing before three members of the Board, excluding the one who made the initial decision.26. At the hearing it will be for the applicant to make out his case;he and a member of the: Board&apos;s staff will be able to call, examine andcross-examine witnesses, and the Board will reach its decision solely in thelight of the evidence brought out at the hearing. While it will be open tothe applicant to bring a friend or legal adviser to assist him in putting his case, the Board will not pay the costs of legal representation. They will,however, have discretion to pay the expenses of witnesses whose attendanceis considered to be necessary.27. Procedure at a hearing will be as informal as it consistent with a proper determination of the application, and the hearing will be in private.Recovery from the Offender28. The view is widely held that a scheme of State compensation forthe victims of crimes of violence ought to make provision for a contribution from the offender, where possible. The Government agree that where the.. , offender has the means he ought, in principle, to be required to makerestitution to his victim, but such cases are likely to be rare in practice and there would be no practical means, under a non-statutory scheme, of enforcing restitution. It is not, however, intended that if a person bringsa civil action he should obtain compensation from the Board in additionto a fully satisfied judgment in that action. Accordingly a person whohas been compensated by the Board will be required to undertake to repay them from any damages he may obtain by suing the offender.Conclusion29. There being virtually no previous experience anywhere in the world to draw upon, the Government readily accept that there is scope for argu-ment both on the principles and on the details of any compensation scheme,and do not claim that the arrangements proposed in this White Paper areincapable of further improvement in the light of experience. Theseproposals are put forward as a practical method of meeting what is nowan acknowledged need simply and quickly, and of ensuring that, in all theconsideration which is being given to new and more effective methods of treating offenders, the sufferings of innocent victims of violent crime donot go unregarded.(31494) Wt. 1251-378 116,116 3/64 SfcS.
