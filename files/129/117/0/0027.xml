THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAfeSTY^&apos; GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1964     - \: :CP. (64) 77 Copy No. g J20th March, 1964 &quot;.        &apos;CABINETTHREATENED INDUSTRIAL ACTION IN THE ELECTRICITYINDUSTRYMemorandum by the Minister of power the five manual workers Trade Unions have threatened to introduce anofficial ban on overtime and work-to-rule starting on Monday, 23rd March. Thereis little chance that the threat will not be carried out, but it is impossible to forecasthow serious its effects will be. If serious supply difficulties occur or are clearlyimminent, we must be prepared to take swift action, including the Proclamationof an Emergency and the use of emergency powers.2. The dispute arises from the conflict between the Unions&apos; claims and theemployers&apos; objectives in negotiating a three-year agreement concluded in January1963, the average annual cost of which is 3-8 per cent on the wage bill. Theemployers hoped to agree status proposals under which manual employees wouldbe paid annual salaries and their real hours, at present averaging 50 - 3 per week,reduced to a standard week of 42 hours. The Unions have, however, submittedseparate claims for a 40-hour week without loss of pay, for an increase incraftsmen&apos;s rates and for improvement of certain fringe benefits. The first twoclaims are a breach of the three-year wages agreement.3. The Boards are not prepared to depart from the three-year agreement,but they have offered to increase the service award for craftsmen, to improveholiday and sick pay arrangements immediately if the status scheme is agreed, andto introduce a full status scheme earlier than they had intended and therefore tomake it possible to move towards a 40-hour week within the three-year agreement.Alternatively, the Unions have been offered an immediate increase in the serviceaward to craftsmen, improvement in holiday entitlement from April 1965, anda 40-hour week in February 1966, the earliest possible date after the end of thethree-year agreement.4. None of these proposals has been accepted and the Unions will not agreeto arbitration in accordance with the National Joint Industrial Council constitution to which they are parties. The Boards clearly cannot go further and since all theUnions concerned are now committed publicly, industrial action starting on23rd March seems inevitable.5. The Transport and General Workers Union and the General and municipal Workers Union are thought to be unenthusiastic, and since they have amajority of the workers it is possible that the threatened measures will not becarried out with full vigour. The Boards are not contemplating any direct appeal tothe men now; at present they are having a good Press and they do not wish toembitter relations with the Unions.6. The chief danger to electricity supplies is in the large cities. Here many ofthe militant Union members work at power stations, loss of supplies from whichcould not necessarily be made good even if the national situation as a whole was nearly normal. This is because possible transfers of power through the grid are limited, especially at present when some lines are out of commission to allow new construction.4131
7. A work-to-rule, which might include absenteeism combined with a ban onovertime, well organised and with the full co-operation of Union members, could reduce supplies very quickly, because generating sets must be attended continuously.The effects of the interruption of the day-to-day maintenance programme wouldbe felt more slowly but cumulatively. The Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association(supervisors and technicians) have assured the Boards that they will co-operate, tothe extent of performing the duties of manual workers, to maintain supplies andhave so informed the manual workers&apos; Unions. This should help in maintainingoutput at first but the Engineers could not continue indefinitely to take the place ofabsentees, and they could not prevent the effects of maintenance interruption from being felt to an increasing extent after a few days.8.   In summary the position is:(a) The Boards have a very good case, have a good Press, and must and will stand firm. The Unions are committed and industrial action seems inevitable, but the scale and effectiveness of it is uncertain.(b) Until more is known of the Unions&apos; tactics and the attitude of their members it is impossible to forecast how quickly serious supplydifficulties will develop. With co-operation from the Engineers onlywidespread absenteeism could cause serious national troubleimmediately.(c) On balance, the probability of power cuts before Easter is not high, but wemust be prepared to act swiftly early next week if necessary.F.
