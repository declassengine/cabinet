HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. P. (64) 602nd March, 1964CABINETMONOPOLIES, MERGERS AND RESTRICTIVE PRACTICESMemorandum by the Secretary of State  or Industry, Tradeand Regional DevelopmentI circulate herewith, for the consideration of my colleagues,a revised draft of the White Paper on Monopolies, Mergers and restrictive Practices.   This takes account of the further consideration which the Cabinet, at its last meeting, invited me to give to it inconsultation with other Ministers (CM. (64) 15th Conclusions, Minute 6).S.H.Board of Trade, S. W. 12nd March, 1964&apos; 4-- ICOPY NO.
DRAFT -WHITE PAPERMONOPOLIES. MERGERS AND RESTRICTIVE PRACTICESThe objective of the Governments economic policy is to achieve      sustainedexpansion and steady growth combined with full employment, stable prices and a sound balance of payments.     This objective can only be realized by the most effective use of the resources at the disposal of the nation.    The government believe   that in this respect competition has an essential rols to play both in stimulating innovation and efficiency and in enabling some of the benefits of the reduced costs of production and distribution to be passed on to consumers.    Itis in this context that the Government is putting forward proposals for further action in the field of monopolies,, mergers and restrictive practices and for thegeneral prohibition of resale price maintenance except where exceraptions are granted by the Restrictive Practices Court.    It is against this background thatthese proposals should be judged01
2.    The present statute law on monopolies and restrictive practices ia containedin the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (inquiry and Control) Act, 1948, and.the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956*    This legislation has played animportant part in the policy of post-war Governments and has led to more competition and thus to a stronger and more efficient economy ffl3o    The Government have made a thorough study of experience both in this countryand abroadj, in the course of which they have given careful consideration to allthe views expressed to them by industry and others.    They are satisfied that legislation on monopolies and restrictive practices on the present lineseffectively meets the particular requirements of this countrye    But they hav&amp;concluded, that the time has come to strengthen this legislation and to extend thefield to which it applies,k10    The principal changes which they think desirable are set out in this paper.M0K0POLIBS5,    The Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (inquiry and Control) Actj, 1943,provides for the investigation of monopoly situations vby -the Monopolies commission at the direction of the Board of Trade..    For the purpose of this Act, a monopolysituation Is broadly speaking one where at least one-third of the market (or of asubstantial part of it) is in the hands of a single firm (or connected group of firms)e    The Commission may be required to report on whether the monopoly situationor the &quot;things done&quot; as a result of or to preserve that situation operate againstthe public interest*Approach to monopoly6*.    As the Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and Regional Development saidia his statement to Parliament on 15th January9 BThe Government are satisfied thatthe &quot;neutral&quot; and uncommitted approach to monopoly on which present legislation isbased remains fundamentally right and they do not propose to introduce into thelaw any presumption that monopoly or size are in themselves undesirables&quot;7o    There are sound reasons for this approach0    Optimum efficiency of operationnay demand large plants, costly research and highly developed marketing arrange-mentso    Units must be large enough to raise the necessary capital to take risks,large-scale production may be necessary in order to compete in international trade.Thus there may sometimes be room only for one or two large firms in an industry.2
But even in such cases there may be competition between the firms, or there maybe competition from imports or from other products - for instance, from asynthetic substitute,,    There may also be potential competition from otherconcerns looking for profitable and unesploited markets.8*    The Government therefore reaffirm their view that it would he wrong tointroduce into the law any presumption that monopoly is in itself undesirable,without regard to the conditions under which it operates, or to the manner 1bwhich it conducts its business .    It follows from this basic approach thatjudgment should only be reached on a particular monopoly after investigation into the way in which it is in fact operating,,    Such inquiries can best becarried out by an investigatory body like the Monopolies Coramisslene    TheGovernment propose therefore not to make any alteration in the basic principlesof the law on monopolies.9*    There are, however, some iarportant changes which the Government thinkdssirableo    The Cojamissioa9 s inquiries have been of great value, but experisaoeh&amp;B saswn that certain aspects of the law are open to criticisms   the Impressiemthat the mm.&amp; body is being asked to carry out the function of &quot;both judgo ami.presaeutor&apos;&apos;1 j   the length of time which Bust go to the production of a report jand the lack of powers in the hands of the government effectively to implement the Commission&apos;a recoasmendations,10*   The first point has been made particularly by industry,,    It rests on amisconception,.    Unlike the Restrictive Practices Court, the Commission is nota judicial tribunal concerned with the application of a body of law in which thelegislature has laid down rules for determining whether particular practicesare or are not against tho public interest.    The Commission is an investigatorybody, and as such its task is to elicit and examia/ss impartially the relevantfactso11.  levertholess, the Government believe that it would be desirable to taw a clearer distinction between the two stages of an inquiry into a monopoly - the investigation into the facts, 1.9. into what is        by the monopoly, and the subsequent assessment of the consequences of theeo acts in relation to thepublic intgiresta3
Appointment of a Registrar of Monopolies12.   The Government consider that this object would be achieved by the appointmentof a Registrar of Monopolies, who would be responsible for making the investigation into the facts and for setting out for the consideration of the monopolies Commission the questions and issues involved.    He would be availableto assist the Commission in its task of assessing where the public interest layby making such further investigation and elucidation as the Commission might require o    He would require sufficient powers to enable- him to make hisinvestigations 013o   The Government contemplate that the Registrar should also be responsible forthe selection of cases for inquiry by the Commission, but the reference of suchcases to the Commission would be subject to approval by the Board of Trade.14.   The Registrar would in addition have the duty of carrying out investigationsrequired under the Governments proposals on mergers (paragraphs      ) and commercial services (paragraphs      ).15.   The Government believe that the appointment of such a Registrar would be ofassistance to the Commission.    At the same time his independence would berecognised by industry.    It is hoped that  a   practice of consultation with himwould develop , at a stage before there was any question of an inquiry by theCommissione    This would be of general advantage and might often make an inquiryunnecessary,,Powers to implement the Commission8 a recommendations160   The Government are satisfied that their existing powers to implementrecommendations of the Commission are not adequate for the purposes these powersnow have to serveo    The powers in Section 10 of the Monopolies and restrictive practices (inquiry and Control) Act, 1948, are mainly directed to dealing withrestrictive agreements, which formed the main part of the Commission&apos; 8 work before they were transferred to the Restrictive Practices Court in 1956.    These powers are not suitable for dealing with those practices of a monopoly, which are foundto be against the public interest.    It is proposed therefore that the provisionsof Section 10 should be recast and expanded to make them appropriate for dealingwith monopoly practices such as, for instance, exclusive dealing, discriminatorypricing and the withholding of supplies.4
517,   In the past the firms concerned have usually been willing to comply withthe Government&apos;s requests in such cases by giving voluntary undertakings.     TheGovernment would want to continue to negotiate voluntary undertakings wherever possible, but there must be effective powers in reserve if the object of thelegislation is not to be frustrated.18.   In the extreme case the monpoly conditions   may be such that the publicinterest would require the monopoly firm to divest itself of interests.     It istherefore proposed to take power   to ensure this.     The Government believe that itwould rarely if ever be necessary to use such a power but they must have it in reserve,,    The power would only be exercised subject to the approval of Parliament,and this would also be so in the case of powers for dealing with monopoly practices.Enlargement of the Monopolies Commission19.   The Monopolies Commission was enlarged in 1953 and empowered to work ingroupso    The size of the Commission was reduced in 1956 when restrictive agreements which had formed the bulk of its work, were transferred to the restrictive practices Court.    It is now proposed to give the Commission new work on mergersand service so    The Government consider that the Commission should again been larged and given the right to work simultaneously in groups on several inquiriesat once*    These changes should also enable the Commission to work more quickly.It is therefore proposed that provision should be made to increase the membership of the Commission to a maximum of twenty-five.Effect of the proposed changes20.  By the changes described in the preceding paragraphs the Government will becreating an improved and more effective instrument for the investigation ofmonopolies, and equipping themselves with appropriate powers for safeguarding thepublic interest*MERGERS21.  The Government recognise and welcome the contribution which mergers can make to the well-being of the economy.    Mergers often enable better use to be made of resources, and result in units large enought both to finance desirable research and development and to produce economies of scale.    Where this is so, mergers are clearly advantageous.    They contribute to the strength of the economy, and putBritish industry in a better position to compete in international trade.
22.   There is, however, a small minority of mergers which may have harmfulresults.     The Government think it desirable that it should be made possibleto have such cases investigated.23.   For this purpose, the Government propose that the new Monopolies commission should be empowered at the direction of the Board of Trade, to inquire into anymerger which would result in a monopoly&quot;1, or would increase the power of an existing monopoly.     It is expected that in practice an inquiry would seldombe necessary.     It would always be possible for firms contemplating a merger to consult the Board of Trade about the proposals.     The Board would welcome suchconsultations.24.   The Government contemplate   directing the Commission&apos;s attention to certainconsiderations to which it should have regard in particular cases in assessingwhere the public interest lay.    They have in mind such considerations asefficiency, technical and technological advance, industrial growth and competitive power in international trade.25.   The Government do not propose to take powers to hold up a merger while itis being investigated.     This could well frustrate desirable mergers.26.   When the Commission had completed an inquiry, their function would be, asin the case of monopolies, to report on whether the merger was against thepublic interest, and if so in what respects.    They would have to evaluate theevidenoe available on such questions as the extent to which competition wouldbe reduced and the benefits to be expected from the larger scale of operationwhioh the merger would permit.27.   In the light of the Commissions Report it would then be for theGovernment to take such aotion as they believed to be necessary.    Where the merger had already been completed it would be treated as a monopoly, and theproposed powers for dealing with monopolies would be appropriate.    But where a merger had not been completed, power would be required to prohibit it or to attach conditions to its completion.     It is proposed to take the necessary powers.6*In the sense of control of at least one-third of the market.
RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES28.   The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1956, is based on the principle thatrestrictive trading agreements are in general adverse to the public interestbecause they impede the free play of competition.     Circumstances may existwhich justify such practices, but this must be demonstrated in each case.     Themain features of the Act are thus:(i)   the compulsory registration of agreements embodying restrictive practices as defined in the Act and their automatic reference to theR g 3 trictive Practices Court;(ii)   the presumption that such practices are against the public interestunless shown otherwise;(iii)   the provision of specific grounds on which the parties can plead that a restrictive practice is justified.29.   The Government believe that as an instrument for dealing with restrictive practices the Act does not require any fundamental change.     It has secured thetermination of many restrictive agreements, and thus promoted more competitivetrading conditions.    However, experience has shown that in the course of timeways of circumventing the Act have been found.    It is now intended to amend theAct to deal with these cases.Information agreements30.   In his second Report&quot;&apos; the Registrar of Restrictive Trading Agreements said:&quot;Not infrequently on the ending of a price agreement the partiesenter into an information agreement under which they send to their trade association or to a central agency their price lists or the prices atwhich they have entered into contracts.    Information to be sent may also relate to the quantities of goods sold, the persons or classes ofpersons to whom they are sold, the discounts allowed and the persons towhom they are allowed, and other terms and conditions of trade which havebeen accepted,,    The trade association or other central agency thencirculates this information to the parties as promptly, at as frequent intervals, and in as much detail as may be desired.&quot;31.   Exchanges of information between firms can be beneficial.    Comparisons of costs can, for example, be used as a means for enabling levels of productivityto be raised.    Agreements for the exchange of technical information may lead tothe development of new methods and processes.    The Government welcome suoharrangements, and intend to see that nothing is done to impede their operation and extension.7*Cnnd. 10b 3
32.   But the Government are not prepared to see the intention of the 1956 Actundermined by exchanges of information the purpose and effect of which is to limit competition.     They therefore propose to bring information agreementswithin the scope of the 1956 Aot, and thus to make them registrable and subjectultimately to consideration by the Court.33.   It is not, however, intended to make all information agreements registrableforthwith.     The Board of Trade would be empowered to call them up for registration by Order, which would be subject to negative resolution ofParliament.     The Board would, however, use this power to call up only suchclasses as appeared to be serving as a device for circumventing the Act.    Theywould see that the use of this power would not involve the frustration of the beneficial exchanges of information such as those described in paragraph 31.34.   The Government recognise that the grounds in Section 21 of the 1956 Acton which a restriction may be justified would often not be appropriate for thedefence of information agreements;   such agreements might be innocent of restraint of competition, but could not be shown to confer any of the specificbenefits provided for in Section 210    It is proposed, however, to introduce anew ground of justification, as an alternative to Section 21.    This is described in paragraph 40.Bilateral agreements35 *   Another way of circumventing the Act is by means of a series of bilateral agreements which are apparently unconnected.    They can be used by a trade association to opera.te a price ring or a central selling scheme.    Theassociation enters into a separate agreement with each of its members, underwhich only the member accepts a registrable restriction.     Such agreements would therefore be outside the scope of the Act, because it covers only agreements inwhich at least two parties accept restrictions.36.   The Government propose to amend the Act to make subject to registrationagreements under which only one of the parties accepts a registrable restriction,that is to say a restriction of the kind specified in Section 6(1) of the Act.The present safeguards in the Act, which prevent ordinary commercial transactions,i*e. ordinary contracts for sale, sole agencies etc., being brought within theAct, would have to be suitably extended.8
Agreements &quot;to the like effect&quot;37.   There ia another -type of case which must be covered in order to strengthen the operation of the Act.    Experience has shown that it is possible to reproducethe restrictive effect of an agreement whioh has already been condemned by making another agreement which is restrictive in somewhat different terms.    Thisis not within the scope of the Order already made by the Court because it is nottechnically an agreement &quot;to like effect&quot;.    For instance, when the Court condemnsa common or minimum price agreement, the parties could replace it by a maximum price agreement which could be operated as a device to achieve the same result.The consequence is that parties to an agreement condemned by the Court can enterinto other registrable agreements which would produce the same results.Grounds for justifying restrictions38.   The Government have given careful consideration to the grounds in Section 21of the Act on which restrictions can be justified.    They have at the same time taken account of representations made to them by industry to the effect that theoperation of the Act has been unduly stringent and has resulted in theabandonment of restrictions which do no harm to the public interest and benefit the industries in question.39*   The Government have no intention of weakening the effect of Section 21 ofthe Act.    They believe, however, that it would be possible without undermining the basic presumption of the Act to introduce a new ground which would be analternative to Section 21.40.   This new ground would allow parties to show that an agreement which didnot restrict or deter competition was not contrary to the public interest.It would provide a defence for agreements which did no harm.    It would be appropriate for information agreements, but its use would not be limited to them.[A defence of this type could also be relevant to the farmers&apos; organisationstrading locally but as these are very small concerns it may be practicable to makeother provision for them.]41.   These amendments do not imply any fundamental change in the principles whichunderlie the restrictive practices legislation,,    Their cumulative effect, however,should be to make this legislation a more effective instrument for dealing withagreements and arrangements whioh limit competition between firms.9
SERVICES42.   The supply of goods is dealt with, so far as monopolies are concerned, bythe Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (inquiry and Control) Act, 1948 and, sofar as restrictive practices are concerned, by the Restrictive Trade PracticesAct, 1956.    Apart from certain minor exceptions neither of these Acts applies to services.43.   In a modern economy the sector concerned with the supply of services is becoming increasingly important.    Not enough is yet known about the operationof restrictive practices in the supply of services to be able to say whether itwould be appropriate to include services in the 1956 Act.4if.s   The Government therefore propose to adopt the same pragmatic approach whichwas applied to goods in 1948 and to make provision for inquiry by the monopolies commission into restrictive practices and monopolies in the field of commercialservices.     They could also make a general reference on particular practices inany part of the field of such services.   [The Government have in mind commercialservices relating to goods.]45.   These inquiries would follow the procedure established by the 1948 Act.The Monopolies Commission would report on the effect on the public interest, andit would rest with the Government to take appropriate action on the Commission&apos;sreport.    They propose to obtain the necessary powers to enable them to take suchaction.46.  Over the last few years, the Government have made a thorough study of thepractice of resale price maintenance.    An extensive fact-finding inquiry by board of Trade officials was carried out in 1960.    Evidence was collected in confidence from representatives of commerce, industry, trade associations, consumerorganisations, trade unions and individuals.    In their study of the practice the Government have taken full account of all the views expressed at that timeand subsequently.47*   Probably around 40 per cent of consumer expenditure on goods goes on price-maintained articles.    A practice which covers this substantial sector of retailtrade is of economic significance.    In a shortage, resale price maintenance maytemporarily delay price increases.    In a period of expansion, however, resale price maintenance keeps prices on average higher than they would otherwise he.RESALE PRICE MAINTENANCE10
48.   Moreover, the effect is not limited to the goods on which prices are maintained,.    Resale price maintenance tends to protect old-fashioned costlymethods of distribution at the expense of more modem and efficient techniques.Since savings in costs cannot be passed on to the consumer in the form of price reductions there is less incentive to make such savings, and less advantage in being cost-conscious.    Any system which discourages the adoption of the best andmost efficient techniques of distribution locks up labour and capital which couldbe employed more effectively elsewhere.49*   In considering this matter the Government have had the interests of consumersparticularly in mind.    Resale price maintenance means that customers are obligedto pay the same price for goods, irrespective of the type of shop they patroniseand of the standard of service which they are offered or which they may want.Where shops cannot compete in prices, they tend to compete in the service theyoffer, or in promotional devices.    But many customers might prefer to be free to choose between different combinations of price   and service.    Resale price maintenance does not permit this.    If there were more scope for pricecompetition between retailers the market would ensure the provision of the range of service and quality for which there was a public demand.50,   The Government have weighed with care the evidence available as to the effects of the abolition of resale price maintenance in countries other than the UnitedKingdom.    These inquiries showed that, in general, the stimulus to competitionresulting from the ending of resale price maintenance has had beneficial effects on prices and methods of distribution, without being attended by the ill-consequences which supporters of resale price maintenance in those countries hadfeared.51 o   The Government have concluded that resale price maintenance is in generalincompatible with their objective of encouraging effective competition and keepingdown costs and prices.52.   To give effect to their decision that the practice of resale price maintenanceshould in general be brought to an end, the Government on 25th February, 1964-introduced the Resale Prices Bill.     This will empower the Restrictive Practices11
Court to grant exemptions from the general prohibition on grounds which havebeen constructed to allow applicants for exemption to put forward the argumentsusually advanced in support of resale price maintenance.53.   The Government are convinced that this legislation will help to produce a more efficient distribution system, aligned more precisely to meeting therequirements of the public.    Consumers will enjoy the benefit in the form of lower prices, and, except in circumstances where maintained prices may be shown to be essential to safeguard the public interest, retailers will be givenfreedom to charge lower prices where they are able and willing to do so.CONCLUSION54.   National prosperity depends on the efficient use of economic resources undercompetitive conditions.    The proposals outlined in this paper are means to thisend.    Practices in restraint of competition and abuse of monopoly power in industry will be subject to more effective procedures.    The Government will havenew powers for dealing with restrictive practices and monopoly in the provisionof commercial services.    In their legislation on resale price maintenance theGovernment are taking action to encourage more competition in the distributive trades.    Taken together, the Government believe that these measures willstimulate enterprise and efficiency in all sectors of the economy.55.   The publication of this paper will give Parliament and the public anopportunity to express their views on the Governments proposals.56.   It is the Government&apos;s intention to introduce legislation as soon as possible thereafter to give effect to their proposals.2nd March, 196412CONFIDENTIAL
