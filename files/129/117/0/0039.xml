CABINETOPERATION OF THE IMMIGRATION CONTROL UNDER THECOMMONWEALTH IMMIGRANTS act memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentThis memorandum, prepared in consultation with the Ministry of Labour,is circulated at the request of my colleagues. It surveys the operation of theCommonwealth Immigrants Act, which came into force in the middle of 1962.Rate of immigration2. During the debates on the Bill, my predecessor and other Ministersemphasised that the object of the Government was not to stop immigration fromthe Commonwealth altogether, but to control it, with the aim of seeing thatimmigrants did not arrive more quickly than they could be absorbed into our national life. In the period just before the control started, net immigration fromthe Commonwealth (excluding the &quot; white Dominions &quot;) was running at a rateof 100,000 to 150,000 a year. Between 1st July, 1962, and 29th February, 1964,net immigration from the whole Commonwealth was 78,000, and net immigratiofrom the predominantly coloured parts of the Commonwealth (excluding tl e&quot; white Dominions &quot;) was 72,000: this is the equivalent of a net rate of colouredimmigration of about 44,000 a year. The average figure conceals a widefluctuation from one period to another, quite apart from the seasonal movementof people from the &quot; white Dominions &quot;. The statistical tables in Annex I showthat there was a slow period immediately after the introduction of the control:an unexpectedly high rate of immigration in the second half of 1963 (for reasons give in paragraph 7 below): and a slackening again in 1964.Control at the ports3. The control is only at the port of entry, and is designed to avoidinconvenience to genuine visitors and students from the Commonwealth. Thearrangements made for them, including the &quot; working holidaymakers &quot; from the&quot;white Dominions&quot;, have worked well. We have to accept that there will be some evasion of the control by students or visitors, some of whom settle and takework after admission; but I am satisfied there is no serious abuse, and I do notat present consider that we need a tighter control, especially as it would be expensive, and difficult to operate without amending legislation, and offensive toother Commonwealth Governments.4. Health control at. the ports is minimal, and extends to only a proportionof arrivals. Voucher-holders are subject to it, and are normally medically examined, but dependants, who present probably a greater risk, go free. Therehas been a steady volume of medical and other criticism of the health dangersbrought by immigrants, notably of tuberculosis, and a demand for routineX-rays of all who arrive at the ports. This would be the only effective safeguard,but would dislocate traffic. Steps are. however, being taken at London Airportto provide X-ray facilities to enable the port medical officers to X-ray thoseimmigrants liable to medical examination who are suspected of tuberculosis.CONFIDENTIAL4233 printed for the Cabinet.

Dependants5. The Act gives a right of admission to the wife and the children under16 who accompany the head of the household when he is admitted, or who cometo join him afterwards. Usually he comes first and his family join him later.From the social point of view it is good that dependants should come, but theeffect of this provision is that a large number of immigrants over whom the Actgives us no control can come here at any time if they wish. Annex I shows thatthe number of dependants coming has been two or three thousand a month.Most are West Indians, but there are also many from India and Pakistan. Wemust expect this flow to continue, and it may increase above the present rate ofsome 30,000 a year.People coming to work6. Commonwealth citizens coming for employment need a voucher fromthe Ministry of Labour under the scheme described in Annex II. There is no discrimination between one Commonwealth country and another. Subject to the25 per cent limitation mentioned below, vouchers are issued on a &quot; first come first served &quot; basis (except to applicants with jobs to come to or with certainskills, who are given priority). Control is exercised by limiting the total number to be issued in a given period. Since mid-1963 no one country has been allowedto have more than 25 per cent of the non-priority vouchers available. This limitapplies to all countries but, in practice, it affects only those with a large numberof applications, i.e., India and Pakistan. Within the limit, vouchers are issuedfirst to persons who have served in the Armed Forces of the Crown in time ofwar or in the United Kingdom Armed Forces since 1945.7. The rate at which vouchers are issued is settled from time to time bya Ministerial Committee under my chairmanship. In 1962 and the first monthsof 1963, we found that many voucher-holders from India and Pakistan did not use their vouchers because they could not obtain passports: about 45,000 voucherswere issued in the first year of control, but fewer than 15,000 were used. Thisinfluenced us, first, to issue for a time more vouchers than we would otherwise have done and, second, to agree that a certain number of vouchers should beissued each week to Indian and Pakistani applicants without passports, and thatthese &quot; disregarded&quot; vouchers should neither be shown in the Ministry ofLabour figures nor counted against the quota until the applicant obtained apassnort and claimed his voucher. Last summer, changes in the policy governing the issue of passports in Pakistan and India resulted in more of the vouchersbeing used and more &quot; disregarded&quot; vouchers being claimed than we had expected. As a result, 20,500 voucher-holders arrived in the second half of 1963(including 16.000 from India and Pakistan), which was more than double thenumber for the previous six months.8. As soon as this trend became apparent, we stopped issuing &quot; disregarded &quot;vouchers and reduced the rate of voucher issue from 750 to 500 and then to 400a week, the present figure. Since vouchers are valid for six months, these measuresdid not. take full effect until January 1964; but the number of voucher-holdersarriving has now fallen from over 3,000 a month to about 1,000. As a result, netcoloured immigration, which had reached a rate equivalent to 60,000 to 70,000 ayear in the last part of 1963, should be considerably lower in the first half of 1964.The waiting list of voucher-holders9. As explained in Annex II, non-priority applications are put on a waitinglist, and dealt with in turn without regard to country of origin, except that, becauseof the enormous number of applications received from India and Pakistan, we decided in July 1963 to limit the number of non-priority vouchers issued to anyone country to 25 per cent of those available. This change took full effect at thebeginning of this year. There are now over 150,000 applications outstanding from india and over 120,000 from Pakistan, and only applicants from those countries who have served in our armed forces, and so get preference within the non-priorityclass, stand a chance of receiving vouchers in the foreseeable future. Because ofthis my colleagues concerned are considering whether to stop accepting applicationsfor a time.
10. In addition, since only some 100 non-priority vouchers are now being issued each week, there is also a substantial delay for applicants from other commonwealth countries. Any person applying now is unlikely to receive hisvoucher for two or three years, and the period of delay will increase steadily. Thisbears particularly heavily on the West Indies, few of whose applicants can obtainpriority vouchers, and we must expect the Governments of those countries topress for special arrangements for their citizens. We do not think it would bepossible to devise any scheme of &quot; territorial quotas&quot; that would be acceptable to the other Commonwealth Governments or, indeed, be logically defensible; butwe may have to consider ultimately the possibility of special arrangements forcertain of the smaller Commonwealth countries and dependent territories whichwould otherwise be denied any emigration to the United Kingdom.Results of the control11. The number of Commonwealth immigrants unemployed in March wasonly 13,402, compared with more than three times that number in the summer of 1962. We seem to have succeeded in keeping the rate of immigration at a level which allows the newcomers to be absorbed into the labour force. The social problems caused by coloured immigration are more intractable and the resultsof the control less easily measured. The problems of housing and education remainacute in certain areas; but I think the local authorities most affected have beenput in better heart and a better position to tackle their problems since the rateof entry was reduced by the Act. We must not under-estimate however theproblems facing the social services in the next few years, as a result of the inflowbefore 1962, the continued arrival of dependants, and the high birth rate amongimmigrants, quite apart from any present and future admissions for employment.On the other hand Commonwealth immigrants, so long as they are employed,contribute to the national output from which ultimately provision is made for housing, education and other social services.Future rate of issue of vouchers12. We have reduced the rate of issue from 750 to 400 a week, as explained in paragraph 8 above. If we were to reduce it further, we would virtually beconfining vouchers to those who have the offer of a specific job in this country(Category A) or who possess certain special qualifications or skills (Category B),and we would be cutting out practically all other applicants (Category C). It wouldbe difficult to square this with what was said on behalf of the Government whenthe Bill was going through Parliament.Deportation13. Under Part II of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act a court may, withcertain exceptions, recommend deportation for a Commonwealth citizen or a citizen of the Irish Republic who is convicted of a crime punishable withimprisonment. Deportation may not be recommended if the offender has certain specified connections with the United Kingdom by birth, descent or citizenship,or if he has been ordinarily resident here for more than five years. Over 1,000recommendations for deportation have been made since the provisions came intoforce on 31st May, 1962; slightly over half were in respect of citizens of the irish republic and almost a third in respect of West Indians. In 86 cases therecommendation was quashed on appeal. I have a discretion not to act on a courfsrecommendation, and I consider each case on its merits, having regard to the offender^ record and to any compassionate considerations that may militate againstdeportation. Up to 29th February, I had signed 455 deportation orders (261 againstcitizens of the Irish Republic) and in 310 cases had decided not to deport. In theremainder a decision had not yet been taken, usually because the man was stillserving a prison sentence.14. Both the Lord Chief Justice and I have been anxious that courts shouldbe better aware of the considerations to be taken into account before recommendingdeportation, and the steps we have taken have had a measure of success. As aresult I am finding that a higher proportion of the recommendations made to mejustify my signing a deportation order.
15. There are two particular points to which I should draw attention. First,the absence of any immigration control over travel from Ireland means that thereis nothing to prevent an Irish deportee retuning to this country, though, if he doesso, he risks imprisonment for up to six months and fresh deportation. More than60 have already been convicted of returning, nine more than once. We have foundno acceptable solution of this problem; it would be hard to justify imposing animmigration control on all travellers between the Republic and the various partsof the United Kingdom merely to secure the detection of returning criminals.16. The second point is that some of our supporters have argued that thefive-year period of residence here which confers exemption from deportation is too short; and Mr. Gordon Walker has recently stated that the Labour Party wishto see the period increased for &quot; serious crimes&quot;. When the legislation was being prepared we decided that five years was an appropriate period, and there is onegreat difficulty about increasing it: citizens of independent commonwealth countries have a right to be registered as citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies after five years&apos; residence here. If they do, they gain exemption in that way from deportation under the Act, which in turn reflects international law asit relates to deportation. There seems little to be said for increasing the period,knowing that citizens of independent Commonwealth countries could secureexemption merely by availing themselves of their right to registration. Analternative would be to make registration discretionary instead of automatic, butthat would alter the whole basis of the present citizenship and nationality law.It is also relevant that aliens may apply for naturalisation after five years&apos; residenceand, if it is granted, thereby acquire exemption from deportation under the AliensOrder.H.

Annex IITHE VOUCHER scheme. Control under the Act is exercised by the requirement that commonwealth citizens wishing to enter this country to take up or to seekemployment must be in possession of a Ministry of Labour voucher.2.   Applications for vouchers are dealt with in three categories, as follows.Category A for persons who have the offer of a specific job in this country.The prospective employer applies for a voucher through his local employment exchange. Applications are considered by the headquarters of the Ministry of Labour who, if satisfied that a vacancy is genuinelyavailable, issue a voucher. Each application has to be carefully studied,as there has been evidence of abuse, and it was announced in December1963 that stricter rules were being applied. Originally vouchers were issued to employers; they are now, like those in the other categories,sent to the Commonwealth citizen concerned through official channels.Category B for persons who do not have the offer of a specific job but who possess certain special qualifications or skills. The acceptablequalifications or skills are determined by Ministers. In late 1963 the listwas shortened, and category B now includes only doctors, dentists,nurses, teachers who are eligible for qualified teacher status in thiscountry, graduates and members of certain professions who have atleast two years&apos; experience in work which in this country would beregarded as appropriate to their qualifications, building trade craftsmen,and female shorthand-typists. Claims to qualifications have to be endorsed by nominated officers overseas. Applications which fail in this category are transferred to category C.Category C for all others wishing to enter this country to seek employment.3. Priority in the issue of vouchers is given to applications in categoriesA and B and, within category C, to persons who have served in the armed forces of the Crown in war or in the United Kingdom Forces since 1945. Othercategory C applications are dealt with on a &quot; first come, first served &quot; basis, exceptthat no one country may receive more than one-quarter of the category Cvouchers (including those for Forces Service priority cases) available for issue.4. The number of vouchers to be issued is determined from time to time by the Ministerial Committee. The number of applicants who have established a claim to priority in categories A and B has so far been generally below thetotal number of vouchers authorised and vouchers have been issued to them without appreciable delay. The effect of any change in the rate of issue thus fallson category C.5. The attached table gives statistics of applications received and vouchersissued from the beginning of control until 27th March, 1964. The demand forcategory C vouchers has greatly exceeded supply.
