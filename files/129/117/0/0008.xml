P. (64) 55) which has been circulated by the Secretary of State  or Industry, Trade and regional development^ I think my colleagues should be aware that a similarproblem has arisen over the question of credit for exports to north korea.    I attach a paper on this which has been prepared by officialso  the Departments concerned.2.       The Cuban and North Korean problems are not of coursecompletely analogous.    But two major factors are common to both -the difficulty of estimating the economic prospects of the country concerned for any length o  time ahead and the strong reaction to beexpected from the United States if we agree to give cover.Foreign Office, S.

COPY N0l2 truth February. 196UHER MAJESTY&apos;S TREASURYEXPORT GUARANTEE COMMITTEENORTH KOREANote by OfficialsTowards the end of last year E.C.G.D. received enquiries aboutthe availability of cover on the possible sale of ships, aircraft,motor cars and equipment for a power station to North Korea, butthey had to tell the firms concerned that they had no authorityto provide cover for exports to this market.     In the light of these enquiries Departments represented on the Export Guarantee Committeehave been considering the possibility of providing cover for this market, and the attached paper prepared by the Board of Trade andthe Foreign Office (which has been agreed by the other Departmentsrepresented on the Committee), is being submitted simultaneously to ministers in the Departments concerned.2.     The Foreign Office consider that it would be wrong to extendE.CG.D. cover for exports to North Korea chiefly because;(a) North Korea has been condemned as an aggressor by, andhas no international status in the eyes of theUnited Nations;(b) the introduction of Government support for trade withNorth Korea would undoubtedly cause difficulty for ourrelations with the United States;(c) it would also be strongly resented in South Korea andmight lead to violence to British subjects and reprisals against British trade and property there;(d) generally, given the political difficulties and thefact that little is known about the North Korean economy,the disadvantages of providing cover outweigh the advantages.3*     On the other hand the Board of Trade and E.C.G.D., whileacknowledging that there are considerable difficulties, considerthat on balance there is not a sufficient case for refusingE.C.G.D. cover for exports to this market.     They argue thats(a) our experience with other Bloc countries suggests thatNorth Korea should be a fair risk;(b) our policy of non-discrimination in trade matters should apply &quot;bo North Korea as to any other country;1
(c)    the Netherlands have offered   cover for five year termson two substantial contracts.     West Germany has indicated a willingness to consider applications on theirmerits5 limited to cash-against-documents terms, althoughnone has in fact &quot;been received.ho     The case is set out more fully in the attached submission.Ministers are asked to decide whether E.C.G.D, cover should he made available for British exports to North Korea.Treasury Chambers,Great George Street,LONDON, S.W.I.C.271-6U2
E.C.G.D. COVER FOR EXPORTS TO NORTH KOREAPresent United Kingdom tre.deThere has been virtually no British trade with North Koreasince the Korean War, and until recently the North Koreanauthorities showed little interest in trading with the West,2.     In the last few months, however, there has been an increasing interest on the part of British firms in trade withNorth Korea.     In october  last the British Council for the promotion of International Trade (an organisation which has&quot;been denounced on several occasions in the House of Commons asa &quot;Communist front&apos; organisation) signed a &quot;Trade Agreement&quot;with North Korea under which the Korean side will deliver metalsand minerals, chemicals, agricultural produce etc. and theBritish side will export special machine tools, complete plants,synthetic fibres, etc.     The &quot;Agreement&quot; provides for deferredpayment facilities to he available for certain exports from each side.3.     Some of the enquiries made of E.C.G.D, appear to come from -this source.     But others of the companies concerned - Mathesons,A.E.I., G.E.C., Handley Page, Rootes and ConstructorsJohn Brown - seem to &quot;be dealing direct with the North Koreans.4.     E.C.G.D. do not at present provide cover for trade withNorth Korea?   until recently there was no demand for it.     Inview of these signs of interest however Departments have &quot;been considering what policy they ought to adopt.Political and other objections to granting cover5.     The question of E.C.G.D. cover for trade with North Korearaises more problems than that of cover for trade with any other country.     As far as North Korea is concerned.(a) There is no British or other Western representation in north Korea.     This does not of course precludeE.C.G.D. cover but it does mean that we cannot intervenewith the North Korean authorities on behalf of E.C.G. D.or ask one of our friends to do so.     The only analogoussituation is that of East Germany, hut the position there is not comparable both because of East Germany&apos;economic importance and because the Federal german republic itself trades relatively freely with east germany and has less tense relations with that countrythan South Korea has with the North.(b) North Korea has been condemned as an aggressor by theUnited Nations and is considered by that organisation to have no international status.     Every year for someyears past we have co-sponsored a resolution in theUnited Nations condemning North Korea&apos;s attitude towardsthe organisation.(c) The Americans have two divisions in Korea and occasionalcasualties still occur.     At the moment there is aparticular difficulty in that the Americans are trying to secure the release of two helicopter pilots seized1
lay the North Koreans and we have undertaken to do what we can to bring pressure to bear on the North Koreanauthorities in this regard.      In particular, we have undertaken not to give North Koreans visas for entry into Hong Kong, and have recently for this same reasonrefused to issue visas to North Koreans wishing tocome to the United Kingdom for trade purposes.     Whenthe hoot was on the other foot the Americans were very helpful on behalf of British subjects in the Yemen andIndonesia.     There is no doubt they would consider the granting of E.C.G.D.  cover for North Korean trade asinconsistent with our undertaking to do the best wecan for their helicopter pilots.6.     The position in South Korea is also difficult.     The SouthKoreans are worried about the progress which North Korea has maderecently, particularly amongst developing countries, in winning a degree of international recognition.     They have asked us andour Western allies to do all we can to check this progress.     TheFederal German Republic in particular considers it very important that Western countries should work together to this end becauseof the implications for their own position vis-a-vis East germany of the establishment of North Korean missions in an increasing number of countries.7.     The South Korean Government would certainly see the decisionto give E.C.G.D. cover for North Korean trade as an act likely to-encourage the emergence of North Korea on the international scene,and as constituting official acknowledgment by H.M. Governmentthat a degree of respectability may be accorded to the north korean regime.     The South Koreans have already reacted stronglyboth here and in Seoul to reports that trade between us and north korea is likely to expand, and have specifically asked forassurances that E.C.G.D. cover will not be given.     We have explained to them that H.M. Government has had no part in recent discussions about such trade and that any developments in our trade with North Korea would not indicate any weakening of our attitude to the authorities in that country.     Our Ambassador atSeoul has, however, advised that the distinction between extensionof E.C.G.D. cover and the official attitude of H.M. government towards the North Korean authorities would not be understood bythe South Koreans, would be further blurred by North Koreanpropaganda and would probably produce a sharp reaction.     this seems all too likely.     The South Koreans are a volatile andunpredictable people and their political situation is at presentdelicately balanced.     In these circumstances we cannot exclude the possibility of violence to British subjects and reprisals -against British trade and property.Arguments in favour of allowing credit cover8.     There is no reliable data about the present state of north korea&apos;s economy, but it is known that it is well endowed withnatural resources.      Indeed it acquired in 1945 nearly allKorea&apos;s resources in water power potential, commercial forests,iron ore reserves and deposits of most major minerals, as well as some two-thirds of the heavy industry.     To what extent this hasrecovered from the destruction of the Korean War is not known.Trade with other members of the Communist Bloc is believed to be reasonably in balance.2
9.     We have in the past had inadequate or unreliable information about other Bloc countries, such as China herself, where we havebeen willing to extend cover.      It is true that the economicsituation in North Korea is if anything more obscure, and wecannot enforce any guarantee of repayment extended by the north korean authorities.     But our experience with Communist countriesgenerally has been good.     Moreover, if, as we understand, theBank of China is prepared to stand behind contracts, the riskwould of course be converted into a risk on China, for business with which country cover is already available.10.   E.C.G.D. credit insurance facilities are provided as a service to United Kingdom exporters in accordance with commercialprinciples and are governed by the nature of the exports and the credit worthiness of the buyer on a basis of non-discrimination.Thus a measure of cover is available for exports to e.g. Cubaand North Vietnam as well as for those to countries of the soviet bloc, including East Germany.11.    Recent consultations with the Berne Union indicate that themajority of its members have had no requests for cover, and some have said that they would be unlikely to agree if asked.Western Germany has indicated a. willingness to consider applicationson cash-against-documents terms on their merits but has so farreceived none.     The Netherlands have offered cover for five yearterms on substantial orders for a ship (for which Jardines ofUnited Kingdom were competing) and an ammonia plant.12.    The South Korean reaction to a decision by us to give cover for trade with North Korea might include reprisals against our exports to South Korea.     These have recently amounted to about 14 million per year, but seem unlikely to increase, whereas thereappear to be possibilities of new business with North Korea, whichmight develop on a greater scale than that with the South.C.271-64
