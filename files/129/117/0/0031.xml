FINANCE FOR UNIVERSITY EXPANSIONMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury and Paymaster general in his memorandum G. P. (64) 78, the Lord President asks forapproval to announce an additional  25 million of building starts foruniversities in 1965.    About 50 per cent must be added to cover the costof fees, land and equipment, so that the proposal for start in 1965 is anadditional investment of about  37 million, of which  9 million would fall in 1965-66.2.       This would be additional to the provision of capital grants for the universities of  33j million already agreed for 1965.    It also comes tous against the background of the fact that the Economic Policy Committeehas at present before it proposals to create a reserve margin of 30 million by postponement if necessary in the public service invest-ment programme - of which the housing component is  10 million.    Thepurpose of this is to enable us to have some room for manoeuvre indealing with the difficult prospect in 1965-66 in respect of the load onthe economy and the building industry.3.       The Lord Presidents proposal is additional to the programmesnow being considered:  it costs about 50 per cent more than the 9,000houses under discussion.    Obviously any decision we take on universitiesmust be taken in relation to priorities with all the other public serviceclaims.Requirement for 1967-68 Numbers4.       The Lord President reports the University Grants Committee(U. G. C.) as saying that &quot;if the Government feel unable, on financial or economic grounds, J:o provide this amount, the Committee must advise that thej3bjective /i.e. places for 170,000 university population by1967-68/ will not be attained&quot;.5.       I am of course in complete agreement with the Lord president that we must honour our commitment to provide the necessary finance for carrying out this objective.

7.       Last October^ Decisions. In the intensive period of inter -departmental discussion of the Robbins proposals last summer, in whichthe U. G, C. fully participated, and on the basis of which I made my recommendations, there was no suggestion at any time of an increase ofcapital programmes of the dimensions now proposed.8.      My colleagues will remember that one of the main subjects ofdiscussion was the priority of Robbing in relation to other educationaldevelopment;  and I was able to reach agreement with the Minister ofEducation on an expanding school building programme which fitted,with what had been arranged for Robbins, into the amount of resources which the Cabinet had allocated to education, and subsequently announced in the White Paper on Public Expenditure.   This could not have beenpossible if anyone had thought of programmes of the scale now proposed.-9.      Sir Keith Murray, then chairman of the U. G. C., advised me thatan increase of the 1964 building starts of  10 million would be &quot;the most practical encouragement&quot;.   He envisaged this, as I understood him, asbeing of only limited practical significance within the relevant short-term period, but as being necessary predominantly for restoring theconfidence of the universities in the Governments intentions.10.     January Decisions.   In January, the Lord President proposed an addition of &quot;at least  20 million&quot; to the 1964 building starts, following a U. G. C. request for an additional  55-60 million for 1964 and 1965.The Lord President was under pressure to make a statement, and Iagreed to  15 million for 1964 (plus   l\ million for equipment, etc.).This was well received in Parliament and, as far as I have seen, noone has suggested that it was inadequate.   I agreed to the acceleration of the existing programmes for 1964 and 1965.   I also agreed that theadditional investment of some  8 million in 1965-66 resulting from these changes should be excluded from the Economic Policy Committee&apos;public investment operation.12.     I also agreed to additional recurrent grants of  20jr million forI964-65/-66/-67.12.     Present Proposals^ for 1965 Starts.   As I have said, we have not had the necessary information to assess the present proposals.   Butthere is an indication that the numbers of residential places to beprovided, and the cost, are higher than had previously been regarded as likely to be necessary;  and that the cost of academic buildings per extraplace is very high; and that some of the projects, although admirableand necessary in the long run, may not be very closely related to theneeds of an emergency expansion.   The cost figures given in paragraph 11of the Lord Presidents paper are misleading, for they relate thestudent numbers wrongly to the building programmes.   The relevantcomparisons are set out in the Annex.13.      The figures seem to imply that, on these proposals, there willbe not even the temporary sacrifice of standards of academic accommo-dation which the Robbins Report envisaged, and none of the crowdingup which has always been expected to take place in the two years at the peak of the &quot;bulge&quot;.   Indeed, there is no evidence at all of the&quot;emergency action&quot; which has always been contemplated to make thefullest possible use of resources in the two years of peak demand.   The-2-
i need for doing this at the lowest possible cost is particularly importantat a time when all other Departments are being asked in view of the prospective load on our resources to abate their public service invest-ment demands for the same year to which the Lord Presidents proposalsrelate.Starts for 196514.     To sum up, I cannot agree with the Lord Presidents proposal for additional building starts in 1965 of  25 million, i. e.  37 millionexpenditure.   No serious attempt has been made to make a reasonedcase, as the University Grants Committee would normally do.   Nor isit shown why this figure, rather than any other, has been chosen as&quot;required&quot; to achieve the student target? nor even an attempt to arriveat a common appraisal of the facts.15,      The Lord President says that the U.G. C*s proposal is a consideredjudgment.   It should then be possible to set out the whys and wherefores.There is nothing in the &quot;buffer committee&quot; idea, either as expounded inthe Robbins Report or in the practice of the last half-century, thatrequires the Government to accept whatever figure the U. G. C. or itssponsoring Department may say is required to carry out the government&apos;s policy, without the normal examination to which all proposals forDepartmental expenditure are submitted.Starts for 1966 and 196716.      The Lord President asks also for a decision for an announcementof building starts of a minimum of  35 million (over  50 million includingequipment, etc,) for each of 1966 and 1967;  with an expectation that further claims for those years will follow.   Here again, there is nosupporting material for this bid.17,      The programmes involve investment in 1967-68/-69 and later years.   The university programme in these years will raise seriousquestions.   On the Robbins figures there will be no substantial expansionof numbers at universities for some years after the peak in 1967-68,and the emphasis will pass to the replacement of obsolescence andconsolidation of an expansion already achieved.   This is one of the fewareas in which the capital demands in the late 1960&apos;s should be muchlighter than they are now.   They must clearly be examined in connectionwith other claims on resources in this period, in particular the invest-ment in school-building which will be required on account of the decisionto raise the school-leaving age.Conclusion18.     I therefore recommend:-(i) no decision be taken on additional starts for 1965 untilthe supporting evidence can be furnished and examined,and until the other public service investment decisionsfor 1965-66?(ii) decision on starts for 1966 and 1967 to be considered along-side other claims on resources for 1967-68 and 1968-69.J. A. B-G.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 123rd March, 1964
ANNEXCOST PER PLACEIn measuring the cost of moving from our pre-Robbins target of150, 000 student places in 1966-67 to one of 170, 000 in 1967-68, it is not sufficient to consider only the additions to existing building programmes.The   33-1 million of building starts already authorised for 1965 are alsorelevant for, on the Lord Presidents argument in paragraph 9 of his paper, they would not be effective in relation to student places in 1966-67oOn this basis the U. G. Cfs proposals involve total building starts of 73j million to provide for the additional 20, 000 students, a buildingcost (for residence and academic buildings) of nearly  3, 700 per place,as compared with an actual cost in recent years of about  2,400 perplace (almost all in existing universities).   The building cost for newuniversities is about  1,500 per place (only very limited provision ismade from public funds for residence in the new universities).2.       The higher cost implied by the latest proposals is largely theresult of including very large sums for student residence.   The original programme of building starts for 1965 included  3,9 million for residenceand additions agreed for 1964 and proposed for 1965 include a further 20 million.   At the building cost per place of  1, 215 taken from theRobbins Report, this would provide residence for virtually the whole ofthe 20, 000 expansion, whereas the Robbins recommendation was thatresidence should be provided for two-thirds of the additional numbers.3.       The provicion of starts for buildings other than residence(including the agreed programme for 1965, which the Lord Presidentignores in his paragraph 11(b)), would be just under  50 million, a building cost of about  2,500 per place.   This compares with the recentcost of about  2, 300 quoted by the Lord President.   But both thesefigures are much higher than could be inferred from the Robbins Report,which suggests an average of about  1,500,   The difference can only bejustified on the assumption that the cost of providing new places in exist-ing universities involves costs very much larger than the provision ofnew accommodation alone would require.4. All the figures above, which refer to building cost alone, must beincreased by up to 50 per cent to cover land, fees, equipment, furniture,etc.-4-
