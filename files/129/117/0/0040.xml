Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and regional development and President of the Board of TradeIn May 1963 Ministers of the Contracting Parties of the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) agreed that the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations should open on 4th May, 1964, and instructed officials meanwhile to work out detailedrules for the negotiations in the light of the general principles which they proceeded to lay down. These provided that the negotiations should extend both to industrial and agricultural products; that they should take the form of substantial and equal linearcuts in their tariffs by the participating countries, subject to a minimum of exceptions;that special rules should be devised for cases where there was a significant difference in level between the tariffs of different countries on the same article and where inconsequence the application of the same percentage cut might work unfairly (theso-called disparities); and that non-tariff barriers to trade should be included inthe negotiation as well as tariffs.2. The Annex to this paper contains an account of the stage which has nowbeen reached. Progress in working out the rules has been slow and it is clear that nothing will be ready for 4th May. In agriculture, special groups have been set upto negotiate commodity agreements for cereals, meat and dairy products; the first two have done some useful preliminary work. Work is also proceeding on themethods of tackling other agricultural products, since most of them are not mainlyprotected by tariffs and it is not practicable to apply a simple linear cut. Underlyingall these discussions is a strong difference of view between the European economic community (E.E.C.) on the one hand and the United States and all the other mainparticipants on the other, the E.E.C. wishing to proceed by binding levels of support for agricultural products in whatever form they take while the United States andother exporters want provisions which will assure access to markets. A furthercomplication is the failure of the Six to agree on their cereals price policy.3. On the industrial side, there is again a strong difference of opinion betweenthe Six on the one hand and the remaining industrial countries on the other aboutthe treatment of disparities. This is explained in paragraph 4 of the Annex:essentially the difficulty is that the rule proposed by the Six would create so manydisparity cases that the whole concept of a linear cut would be endangered.4. In these circumstances there were signs recently that the United states might wish to use the meeting on 4th May to force a showdown with the Sixwhich might have imperilled the whole Kennedy Round. It has become clear,however, in the talks which the Permanent Secretary, Board of Trade, Sir RichardPowell, had last week in Washington with President Johnson&apos;s special representativefor trade negotiations, Mr. Herter, and his officials that this is not their intention.Nor does it seem likely that the Six will want to push matters to extremes at thisstage.5. The United States now consider that the meeting of Ministers on 4th Mayshould merely note such progress as has been made (including, if possible,agreement that the linear cut should be 50 per cent); instruct officials to intensifytheir efforts to find pragmatic solutions of the outstanding difficulties on agriculturePrimed for the Cabinet.

and tariff disparities; and accept the date of 10th September which has now been proposed for the submission of exception lists. This will suit us. We can also expectbroad agreement by Ministers of the Six to an outcome on these lines. It may bedesirable, however, to hold a further meeting in Geneva during July to reviewprogress and possibly to postpone the date for the submission of exception lists,since the United States may well not wish to put theirs in until after the presidential election.6. All this means that progress in the Kennedy Round is going to be veryslow. We must accept this. The United States will not be ready for serious bargaininguntil their election is over. The Six as always are content to play things slowly.No initiative we could take can alter this situation. We have considered and discussed with the United States the possibility of substituting for the disparitiesrule some proposal for harmonising tariffs, the effect of which would be thatthe lower the existing tariff, the smaller would be the percentage cut to be appliedto it. This might suit us better than an unsatisfactory disparity formula, but theUnited States dislike it and, though similar to schemes canvassed by the Frencha year ago, it is by no means certain that it would now be acceptable to the Six.I am sure that for the time being at any rate we could gain nothing by putting this idea forward.7. I am not yet satisfied that it will prove impossible to find some means of reducing the number of disparities that the Six claim. This is one of the matters which I hope to discuss with M. Jean Rey, member of the E.E.C. Commissionresponsible for external affairs, when he visits London on 28th April. If in the end the Six insist on retaining an excessive number of disparities we shall simply haveto withdraw enough concessions on our side to secure a final balance. I doubt,however, whether we shall get the last word from the Six on this for some timeto come; they may, for example, first want to see whether the United States areprepared to make any move on non-tariff barriers.8. On agriculture the best we can do for the present is to try to ensure thatthe United States and the Six keep talking. We have ourselves little to gain directly from the agricultural side of the Kennedy Round, but we have a strong interestin seeing that the United States do not force a breakdown of the whole negotiationbecause they cannot get an acceptable settlement on agriculture. Hitherto theyhave tried to keep the agricultural and industrial sides of the negotiations in step.It may become difficult to do this if a move forward on the industrial side becomespossible by the end of this year, and the United States may then have to decide whether to let the agricultural negotiations lag behind and see what can be patchedup in -the final stages when the results of the industrial negotiation are emerging.We shall have to wait for the United States election before we can see at all clearlywhat the possibilities are.9. In brief, my conclusion is that we are not likely to get down to seriousnegotiation on industrial tariffs until the beginning of next year, and possibly not until later still on agriculture. Assuming that neither the United States, on theagricultural issue, nor the French for other reasons, force a breakdown, thenegotiations would probably go on through 1965 and into 1966, with cuts in tariffstaking effect in stages over the next four years. What their full effect would be Ishould not wish to guess; but I should expect the average cut in the tariffs of thethree main participants, though falling well short of 50 per cent, to be considerably greater than anything which has come out of previous Tariff Conferences.10.  Accordingly I ask my colleagues to agree that (a) I should seek an outcome at the meeting on 4th May on the lines suggestedin paragraph 5 above;(b) we should continue to seek pragmatic solutions of the problems ofdisparities and of agriculture on the lines we have hitherto followed andshould not take any new initiative;(c) we should review the position in July.E. HBoard of Trade, S.W. 1,27th April, 1964.
ANNEXIt was agreed a year ago that the &quot; Kennedy Round &quot; of General agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Trade and Tariff Negotiations should begin on 4th May next. As this date approaches, no agreed basis for detailed negotiationshas been settled either for industrial tariffs or for agriculture.Industrial Tariffs2. The difficulty on the industrial side is centred on the problem of tariffdisparities. This immensely complex issue stems basically from the French view not in itself altogether unreasonable that to apply equal cuts to unequal tariffswill not give a fair result. (The United States tariff and to a lesser extent our owncontain a good many rates on important trade items which are much higher thanthe rates in the relatively level common tariff of the European economic community (E.E.C.) The French have always wanted a basis for negotiation,variously described as harmonisation or ecretement, which would systematicallyprovide for higher tariffs to be cut more than lower ones.3. The French presented this proposal before the GATT Ministerial Meetinglast May in a tactless way and in an illiberal form which persuaded the UnitedStates that they were being asked to give large concessions for a small return. WithErhard&apos;s help Governor Herter succeeded in insisting that the basic rule for thenegotiations should be an equal, linear (i.e., across the board) cut in all tariffs butconceded that &quot; significant disparities in tariff levels &quot; should be dealt with by&quot; special rules of general and automatic application &quot;. It was a Pyrrhic victory.The French were browbeaten and isolated and this has rankled ever since. It leftthem in a mood to exploit for obstructive purposes the considerable oppertuinities which the sheer complexity of the disparity problem affords their able officials and put them in a strong position with the Five to do so.Work on the Tariff Negotiating Plan4. This background explains why the many meetings of experts in Genevafrom July onward have bogged down and failed to produce acceptable negotiatingrules to deal with the problem of disparities. In briefest summary, it may be said thata consensus has developed among all the main participants other than the E.E.C.in favour of a basic rule providing that a lower-tariff country should claim thebenefit of disparity treatment the Six propose that this benefit should be a rightto make only half the normal tariff cut only where the higher tariff country wasits principal supplier of the item concerned. If this rule is not applied, the numberof disparity cases is likely to be so large that the concept of a linear cut in tariffsis no longer meaningful. Moreover, the impact of a great many disparity cases fallson third countries who are in no way to blame for the disparity: in particular thismeans that the disparities between the E.E.C. and United States tariffs would beallowed seriously to reduce the scope for tariff reductions on items of major importance in intra-European trade.5. The proposals made by the E.E.C. Council of Ministers in Decemberignored this consensus. The counter-proposals made by the United States in Marchspecifically called for the adoption of the &quot; principal supplier &quot; rule. Despite strongUnited States pressure and a document from the expert group in Geneva whichsets out with clarity and force the reasons for having such a rule, the E.E.C.Ministers have not changed their mandate to the Commission. The furthest theyhave gone is to offer to consult with &quot; certain European countries &quot;, which do not include the United Kingdom, in order to consider case-by-case any of their disparityclaims against the United States which could have &quot; serious consequences &quot; for european countries who were their principal suppliers. This is how the matterstands as 4th May approaches.The 4th May Meeting6. Great significance has become attached to 4th May as the formal openingdate for the Kennedy Round and a postponement of the meeting or reducing its4259
importance by holding it below Ministerial level would be presentationallyunfortunate. On the other hand any form of showdown with the big industrial countries publicly quarrelling in the midst of the United Nations Conference on trade and Development (u1ncta1d) would be worse than no meeting at all. Inthese circumstances no real negotiation, e.g., in the direction of renewed pressure on the Six for a principal supplier rule, can take place.7. Sir Richard Powell had talks in Washington with Governor Herter on20-22 April which were reported in Washington telegrams 1482-4 and 1507-9.The United States readily agreed that there should be no dangerous confrontationor showdown with the Six at the Ministerial meeting of the GATT trade negotiations Committee on 4th May. Both sides felt that the meeting should id) register such progress as has been made, including (in whatever termscould be agreed) general acceptance that the aim of the negotiationshould be a 50 per cent linear tariff cut with the minimum of exceptions;(b) take note of the gap remaining between the positions of the E.E.C. and therest on tariff disparities and urge that intensified efforts should be madeto bridge it;(c) confirm the date (10th September) proposed by the Trade NegotiationCommittee (T.N.C.) at official level for tabling lists of exceptions subjectto its being established at a further meeting of the T.N.C. at about the endof July that satisfactory progress in closing the &quot; disparity gap &quot; hadbeen made;(d) on agriculture the Ministers would take note of a report by the AgricultureCommittee setting out the sharp division of view which now exists between the United States (and other main participants) and the Sixabout the basis for negotiation, and would require further work to bedone in elucidating the problems pragmatically (commodity bycommodity). In order to keep the agricultural side of the negotiationreasonably closely in step with the industrial side, it may also be proposed that request lists and offer lists (on a commodity by commoditybasis) should be tabled at the same time as the lists of exceptions in industrial tariffs.Prospects After 4th May(i) Industrial Tariffs8. While it is desirable to maintain pressure on the Six in this way throughthe summer, it seems to us unlikely to expect much change in their position. the indications are that they connect any further concessions that they might make on disparities with the negotiating position as it develops on exceptions, non-tariff barriers and even agriculture. In other words they may envisage an eventualpackage deal in which all these elements are brought into the balance.9. This will present us not immediately but later in the year with some difficulty in deciding whether to table our list of exceptions while the &quot; disparitygap &quot; remains open. Our feeling has been (paragraph 4 above) that a negotiationstarting from the large number of disparities now claimed by the Six would loseits linear character. For this reason we believed that a switch to some reasonableformula for harmonisation would in the end produce a better result.10. It was made clear to us in Washington that the United States Governmentis very unlikely to be brought to agree with us about this. They fear that to switchto a new concept now would only induce another prolonged preliminarynegotiation with further delay to the substantive bargaining. They still professsome optimism that the Six may yet reduce their disparity claims. But even if this does not happen, they would prefer to negotiate by putting down their full offerson the table (in the hope that this in itself would tempt some in the Six to press for more to be offered by the E.E.C.) and then withdrawing offers to whatever extentseemed necessary to balance the bargain. If we accept this method, we may beable to negotiate on the basis that we should not be committed to grant the Sixa &quot; free ride &quot; for all the disparities invoked by them but should adjust our initiallist of exceptions in the course of the negotiations so as to strike a reasonable balance.
(ii) Agriculture11. The course of the negotiations will also, of course, be influenced by thedifficulty of achieving results on agriculture satisfactory to the United States andother exporters. It seems that so long as the crucial issue of the E.E.C. grain price is unresolved, the Commission will feel bound to maintain a rigid adherence acrossthe whole range of agricultural products to the &quot; montant de soutien &quot; doctrinewhich the United States have made it clear that they cannot accept as a basis for negotiation. Even thereafter it is far from clear that the Six will make offers on a scale acceptable to the exporters. And on the vital question of third country access to the E.E.C. market for the main commodities, the chances of getting genuineor workable assurances in quantitative terms cannot be rated high.12. The present United States position is that the negotiations must go forward on both the industrial and agricultural points in step. Thus even if theindustrial side could go forward on the basis described above, lack of progress on agriculture may face the United States with deciding between entering intothe industrial negotiations while leaving the agricultural side to lag behind and bringing the agricultural issues to a crunch even if this means a break. This issuewill clearly not be faced before their election and it is conceivable that after it anew Administration with a strong mandate could accept a narrowing of UnitedStates objectives on the agricultural side. But this is by no means certain.Summary of Prospects and Conclusions13. The total prospect is not, therefore, a happy one. The industrialnegotiations are not now likely to start in earnest before early in 1965. The basis for them is likely to be one involving a great deal of detailed bargaining ofdisparities, exceptions and non-tariff barriers in order to reach a balanced package.Into this must also be fitted some agricultural settlement acceptable to the UnitedStates and other exporters. The negotiations are likely to be prolonged and the resultant tariff cuts may not come into effect until well on in 1966 or even the endof that year. Nevertheless the cuts might still be of a depth and range impressiveby comparison with the results of earlier tariff conferences.14. We cannot improve on this prospect by changing course now. At some stage, particularly if they cannot accept any narrowing of their agriculturalobjectives, the United States may possibly contemplate carrying on the negotiationswithout the Six. Our own interest, however, is even greater in getting the E.E.C,tariff down than the United States tariff: our trade in Europe is bigger and growingfaster and is vulnerable to the discrimination arising from the full operation ofthe E.E.C. Customs Union. If it were to become clear that the Kennedy Roundmust fail, we should probably do better, therefore, to see what tariff reductions could be negotiated separately (on a most favoured nation basis) with the E.E.C.and the United States. It would seem wholly premature, however, to contemplate any such alternative while there is still a reasonable chance of reaching a multilateralsettlement in the Kennedy Round.
