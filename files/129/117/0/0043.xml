CP.(64) 935th May, 1964COPY NO.52CABINETUNITED KINGDOM FISHERY LIMITSMemorandum by the Lord ChancellorOwing to arrangements made with the French, we cannot draw the new straight base lines and bay closing lines from which theterritorial sea and the new proposed fishery limits would.be measureduntil we have ratified the recent European Fisheries Convention, andwe cannot ratify that Convention until we have passed the necessary legislation to extend our fishing limits.24      A Bill has now been drafted to extend our fishery limits inconformity with the Convention.    This provides for a straight extension to 12 miles for fishing.    The drawing of the base lines is done by theexercise of the Royal Prerogative.3.       There is one difficult question with regard to the Bill withwhich I feel I must trouble my colleagues.     We have signed andratified the 1958 Convention on the High Seas.   Under that convention the. existence of a fishery limit beyond the limits of the territorial seais not recognised.    The Convention in terms provides that outside thelimits of the territorial sea, i. e. on the high seas, there is anunrestricted right of fishing.4.       The Bill as drafted should create no difficulties with the other parties to the Fisheries Convention.      The problem arises with regardto the enforcement of the proposed limits, against countries not partiesto the Convention, in particular the U.S.S.R., Poland and Norway.Steps have been taken to find out whether even if they do not agree to theextension we propose to make, they will at least acquiesce in it.   Theirattitudes are not known as yet and there may be some delay before theyare known.5.      If we proceed with the Bill as drafted, the question may be raised in Parliament and, if any of these countries object, before theInternational Court whether our action is in breach of international law.While we would seek to maintain that since the 1958 convention on the High Seas international law has changed as so many countries have established Fishery Limits beyond the limits of the territorial sea,this argument might not prevail before the International Court.    we might then, to show that we were not in breach of international law, saythat what we had in effect done was to extend our territorial sea to twelve miles but with a view only to exercising jurisdiction with regardto fishery limits.    This argument would lend force to the view that itis possible to have a 12 mile territorial sea.   But in my opinion the time has long passed when there was any hope of any general acceptance bythe nations of a lesser limit for the territorial sea.-1-

60      To avoid this possible difficulty with regard to internationallav/j the Foreign Office have suggested;, and I understand would prefer,, that the Bill should provide for the extension of our limits(a) by agreement (b) against any other states who apply similarlimits against us on a basis of reciprocity and (c) on any other grounds recognised by international law.    One difficulty about thisis that it leaves it uncertain for an indefinite time who can fishwithin the new limits.     Tf the Bill were so drawn, there would beimmediate enquiry to know why it was so drawn, and disappointmentwhen it became known that the fishery limits would have a limitedapplication.We have not challenged the unilateral extension of the fishery limits at the Faroes and while we did not accept the originalunilateral extensions round Iceland, we did not challenge them beforethe international court.7.       The Bill which has been considered by the legislation committee will have to be $redrawn if effect is given to the view ofthe Foreign Office.    That can be done but it will mean delay.8.       To be sure of reaching the statute book the introduction of theBill should not be long delayed and I gather it is desirable that itshould be introduced before Whitsun.9. The Bill as drawn does not come into force until an order ismade bringing it into force. The passage of the Bill into law couldnot of itself on any view be regarded as a breach of international law.10.      While it would be preferable to know the views of the Russians,Poles and Norwegians before the Bill is published, it may not bepossible to obtain them.11.      I myself am in favour of introducing the Bill in its present form.    Both Russia and Norway have 12 miles limits and in its application to them, we could seek to justify our action on the ground of reciprocity.12.      I would ask the Cabinet to decide -(a) whether the Bill should be introduced in its presentformj(b) and if so, whether it should be introduced beforeWhitsun.D.Lord Chancellors Office,House of Lords, S.W.1,5th May, 1964-2-
