Printed lor the Cabinet.  April 1964CP. (64) 84 Copy No.   528th April, 1964CABINETMAJOR DEFENCE WORKS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IN 1965-66Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Defence and theMinister of Public Building and works in his paper CP. (64) 8 of 7th January the Chief Secretary invited the Cabinetto agree that &quot; expenditures on Major Defence Works in the United kingdom in 1965-66 should not be more than 5 per cent greater than in 1964-65 &quot;. At their meeting on 14th January the Cabinet agreed to defer a decision on this proposalpending a study by the Economic Policy Committee on the means by which theexpansion and modernisation of the construction industries might most effectivelybe promoted (CM. (64) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 2). A memorandum on thismatter has been circulated to the Cabinet (CP. (64) 31).2. In the meantime we have had an examination carried out of the implications of reducing expenditure on Major Defence Works in the UnitedKingdom in the manner suggested by the Chief Secretary. The results of this examination are set out in the attached report by officials of our two Departments.3. This report shows that, excluding our international commitments forNATO infrastructure and works for the United States Air Force, as well as thePolaris construction programme, which clearly cannot be reduced, a limitation ofexpenditure on major Defence Works to a 5 per cent increase in 1965-66 wouldmean a reduction of approximately  2 million on a planned programme of 38-78 million in 1965-66, i.e., a cut of over 5 per cent. This would be additional to the cut of  2 million already made on the 1964-65 estimates for married quarterswhich will cause a delay in the programme which will not be overtaken for someyears. As explained in the report a further cut of  2 million would have to fallquite largely on the Serviceman&apos;s living accommodation, and we regard this as unacceptable from the point of view of Service morale.4. Whilst we appreciate the need to avoid straining our resources andoverloading our investment programme in 1965-66, it should be borne in mind that Service Works count for only a very small part of the total load on thebuilding industry. Preliminary estimates for these works, including maintenance,for 1965-66, show a total gross expenditure of  158 million, whereas the totalexpenditure in the construction industries in 1963 was over  3,100 million and isexpected to be some  3,500 million in 1964. We believe therefore that theimposition of an arbitrary reduction which would be large in relation to the planned programme but negligible in the context of the total load on theconstruction industries is undesirable. This is not to say that no contribution atall should be made by Works for Defence. We propose therefore that ourDepartments should exercise the most careful scrutiny with the object of reducing4189
the increase to the minimum. This could be done in the context of the Long-termCostings this summer and the situation could be reviewed when the results of thisexercise are available.conclusions.   We ask our colleagues:(a) to note the attached report;(b) to agree that no arbitrary reduction should be made at this stage but thatthe question should be further reviewed when the Defence ReviewCostings are available.P. T.G. R.6th April, 1964.MAJOR DEFENCE WORKS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IN 1965-66Joint Note by Officials of Ministry of Defence and Ministry ofPublic Building and works in his paper CP. (64) 8 of 7th January the Chief Secretary invited the Cabinetto agree that &quot; expenditure on major defence works in the United Kingdom in1965-66 should not be more than 5 per cent greater than in 1964-65 &quot;. TheMinisters of Defence and of Public Building and Works instructed us to examinethe implications of this proposal. We have consulted officials of the Admiralty,War Office and the Air Ministry.2.   Planned expenditure on major defence works, excluding married quarters,in the United Kingdom is estimated to be as follows:1964-65 1965-66  million   millionNavy   Polaris...............         2-0 50Navy-NATO......      ......         3-23 2-63Navy normal programme   ......         8-22 9-12Navy Total        ...      ...... 13-45 16-75Army      .................. 16-2 180R.A.F. Air-NATO    ............ 1-8 1-9U.S.A.F............. 2-8 3-25R.A.F. normal programme......       10-55 11-66R.A.F. Total      ......... 15-15 16-81Total all Services ...... 44-8 51-563. In these figures are however included items which could not be brought within the scope of investment restrictions. NATO infrastructure and works forthe United States Air Force are international commitments funded from NATOand United States sources and it is assumed that the situation is not so serious as to make it impossible for us to honour our obligations. The Polaris programme is a commitment of a similar nature: unless it proceeds as planned the shoreinstallations will not be ready in time for the submarines to operate when theyenter service and Government policy could not be fulfilled. We consider therefore that these three commitments, which amount to  9-83 million in 1964-65 and 12-78 million in 1965-66, must be omitted from consideration and that the relevant figures are those for the remaining major works, namely,  34-97 million in 1964-65 and  38-78 million in 1965-66.4. On the basis of these figures proposed expenditure in 1965-66 shows an estimated increase of  3-81 million or 11 per cent. If the increase were limitedto 5 per cent, the 1965-66 figure should be reduced to  36-72 million, a reduction
of approximately  2 million on the present estimate. The precise proportion ofsuch a cut which each Service would need to bear would need most careful examination. For the present purposes it has been assumed that works for theArmy would have to be reduced by  1 million and those for the Navy and theR.A.F. by  0 - 5 million each.5. As regards the Royal Navy, a reduction of even  0-5 million in 1965-66would mean deferring for at least a year over half of the Navy&apos;s 1965-66 MajorWorks programme. To avoid this, some items planned to start in 1964-65 wouldhave to be deferred for at least two years instead. The total capital value of theschemes concerned would be about  1-75 million, that is nearly 20 per cent of ayear&apos;s programme. Almost every aspect of naval activity ashore would be adversely affected: Dockyard modernisation and Fleet Support; scientific laboratoryaccommodation; the welfare of civilian employees; and last, but probably mostimportant of all, single living and training accommodation for naval personnel.The sailor when ashore still has to live in 19th century barracks or wartime huts,and wide publicity has been given to modernisation plans. The items could not be completely deleted, and when reinserted in a future year would have to displaceother similar items planned for that year.6. The effect on the Army must be considered against the background that18 months ago the War Office had, fully under way, a programme to make good the neglect of decades in the provision of accommodation for the Army in theUnited Kingdom; this programme would have been completed by 1970 or soon after. Since then cuts have already been made which have put back almost allprojects in the earlier years by 12 months and later projects by more. This revised programme did not seem wholly unreasonable on the assumption that it would notbe reduced further. Additional cuts now would mean that no completion date forthe programme could be foreseen.7. The total amount available in 1965-66 would be less than that provided in the long-term costing for continuation services alone. In order to achieve the saving required it would be necessary to postpone for 6 to 12 months some fiveprojects of a total value of about  5 million. Unavoidable delays to some 15 to 20projects to a total value of about  20 million have already been assumed in thefigure of  18 million mentioned in paragraph 2 above: should this turn out tobe a pessimistic assumption more projects will have to be deliberately postponed.Although this would be possible, the impact of a reduction in the programme onrecruitment and the retention of soldiers could be very serious at a time when this can least be afforded. It is difficult for any soldier to understand why considerableparts of the Army should be expected to continue to live in huts.8. In the case of the R.A.F., a saving of  0-5 million could only be achieved by deferring works services to a total estimated cost of  1 million to a later yearunless, fortuitously, a change of policy or deployment made it possible for a service to be cancelled. Naturally, the deferment must fall mainly on domestic services and amenities in preference to technical requirements but it would also probably delay the introduction of fuel economy schemes proposed by M.P.B.W. for variousR.A.F. stations. Moreover, continuing delay in introducing amenities or relievingovercrowding in messes, etc., would have an adverse effect on morale, the finaloutcome of which would be difficult, if not impossible, to assess.31st March, 1964.
