REPORT BY OFFICIALSE.C.G.D. COVER FOR CREDIT BUSINESS WITH CUBABackground1. Normal cover for export credits to Cuba was suspended by the E.C.G.D.Advisory Council in July 1960 for political and economic reasons. Since November1961 cover has been available under Section 2 of the Act, but only for cash business.2. Ministers agreed last September that E.C.G.D. might, exceptionally, cover a contract for the sale of buses by Leylands Ltd. on terms of payment involvingfive years&apos; post-shipment credit.3. In October English Electric Ltd. asked E.C.G.D. to cover two contracts forthe sale of diesel electric locomotives to a total value of  5-5 million. This was originally on cash terms but they later proposed five-year credit. Other requests for credit insurance have followed.Cuban trade policy. Cuba&apos;s trade policy is changing from complete dependence on theCommunist countries to much freer interchange with Europe, Canada and Japan.Not all Cuban requirements can come from the bloc, and our Ambassador has seen&quot; signs of increasing irritation &quot; at Cuban dependence on it. President Castro haspublicly referred to the need to buy more from various capitalist countries, includingGreat Britain, and a directive has apparently been issued to the Ministry of foreign trade stating that trade with Britain (and other countries) &quot; will increase &quot;. Suchbusiness, in so far as it concerns capital and semi-capital goods, is normally done on credit; and it appears that the Cubans envisage normal commercial terms (i,e., notexceeding five years&apos; credit). At present Cuba&apos;s trade balance with this country is strongly favourable, to the extent of  4-6 million in 1962 and  10-5 million in 1963.5. In November a Cuban trade delegation toured Britain, before visitingFrance, Sweden, Spain, West Germany and Italy. It met Board of Trade officials and exporting firms, having announced that they had authority to spend  10 million on heavy equipment to be used primarily to repair damage caused by HurricaneFlora, and to carry out anti-flood works. So far exporters have made tentativeapproaches for E.C.G.D. cover on some  6 million of this business, andSimon-Carves Ltd. have asked for cover on a  3-5 million polythene plant. TheCubans are also interested in equipment for the modernisation of dairy and cattlefarming.6. The Cubans are now said to wish to adopt Leyland buses as the sole meansof public road transport, and to this end require buses (including the 400, valued at 3-7 million for which a contract has just been signed) to a value of about 13 million for delivery in the period 1964-68. Repayment would be over five years from delivery. On the assumption that all the potential business mentioned is insuredwith E.C.G.D. the Department would have to assume a total liability of  29 - 6 million(including the pre-Castro contracts), but an unknown amount of the trade delegation^  10 million may go to other countries. Repayments would extend atleast until 1972 at a rate of around  4 million per annum up to 1969, tailing offsharply thereafter. In addition to this possible credit business E.C.G.D. is currentlycovering cash contracts of  0 - 3 million per month.Past defaults7.   Defaults arising during the years 1959 to 1961 were of two sorts:(a) those stemming from the sale of oil and invisible exports; these havea strong political flavour and are still unsettled. They total about 8 million.
(b) those arising from normal sale-of-goods transactions. Repayments inthis category have been comparatively good, and Britain seems tohave been treated better than other Western nations. Under an informal agreement of 1961, some  0-8 million has now been repaid,and the Cubans have now agreed to repay a further  0-7 million overthe next two years. This would clear virtually all of these debts (andE.C.G.D. will have recovered most of its claims payments of about 1 million).In addition, insurance companies hope to discuss their claims soon.8. In June 1960 the Cubans confiscated the assets of two United Statesoil companies and Shell, following the refusal of all three companies to acceptRussian crude oil for refining. The Shell property expropriated was worth 16 million; and Shell were also owed  6 million for oil deliveries in the early days of the Castro regime. Representations by Her Majesty&apos;s Government at thetime had no success.9. The Minister of Commerce has now told our Ambassador that PresidentCastro is prepared to start discussions with Shell about compensation for itsassets, in recognition of the political significance of the Export Credit guarantee of the Leyland contract and also of the United Kingdom&apos;s co-operative attitudeover trade with Cuba. This is tricky; Shell&apos;s world-wide interests prevent theirgetting any special advantage over the oil companies, especially as the latterhave insisted that any Indonesian settlement must also include Shell. We areconsulting the United States Administration and Shell before replying.Cuba&apos;s earnings10. It is difficult to estimate Cuba&apos;s economic position. There are no officialfigures for her balance of payments or international reserves in recent years.The only official figures released are those for the trade deficit in 1962 and thefirst quarter of 1963 ( 85 million and  37 million respectively). Sugar exports are the mainstay of the economy, but last year&apos;s crop was the worst for 20 years,partly because of mismanagement of the crop. In spite of a serious attempt toimprove methods, the hurricane will have prevented an improvement in thisyear&apos;s crop. The high world price has reduced the seriousness of. this situation,and prices may remain fairly high this year, perhaps falling from  85 per tonat present to  70 at the end of the year. Cuba&apos;s convertible currency earningsfor 1963 may be. in the region of  65 million and, given reasonably stable sugarprices, those for 1964 may be at least as great. The long-term prospects forsugar are less certain. The world&apos;s cane producers are nearly all expandingproduction, but as cane sugar is a three-year crop the effects of this will not be felt until about 1965 at the earliest.11. For Cuba, therefore, the general short-term trading prospect is quitebright, although imports will have to be increased substantially because of theeffects of Hurricane Flora. The long-term prospects are more difficult to assess.12. The Castro regime appears secure for the foreseeable future, and it is highly improbable that it can be overthrown from within. The only alternative isan attempt from outside with full and undisguisable support from the UnitedStates, and this is unlikely as long as Cuba is firmly supported by the Soviet Union.That this support will continue in the political and military spheres is a reasonableassumption. It is much less safe to assume that Soviet economic assistance to Cubawill be maintained at its existing level. Despite the demonstrations of amity duringPresident Castro&apos;s recent visit to the Soviet Union relations between Cuba andthe Soviet Union have cooled as a result of Castro&apos;s refusal to sign the nucleartest ban treaty and other evidence of his equivocal attitude in the Sino-Sovietdispute. Castro&apos;s behaviour is unpredictable: he could at any time do something which would provoke the Soviet Union into trying to discipline him by a curtailment or slowing down of economic aid, particularly if his conduct was suchas to prejudice Soviet efforts to achieve some kind of detente with the UnitedStates. There is no doubt that any tightening of the Soviet purse strings would havea serious effect on Cuba&apos;s economy and her ability to pay her debts.13. For the time being however it seems from our inadequate information that the Cubans have the means as well as the desire to purchase substantialamounts of capital and semi-capital goods from nonjCommunist countries. Ifthese do not come from Britain they will come from Western Europe or from Japan,
which in 1962 was the biggest buyer of Cuban sugar outside the Communist bloc.Competition from Western Europe has not yet developed but if Britain is to retainher present advantageous position in Cuba we consider a more liberal attitudetowards credit insurance will be called for.Attitude of other countriesv 1.14. There is no evidence that other countries will outbid us in offering creditterms to Cuba. In fact, on past form, they are likely to be much more cautious than we. They probably all wish to increase their trade with Cuba but they have so farapparently insisted on payment by cash or short credit. Of the major credit insurersin Europe the French, Germans and Danes give at present no guarantees for sales to Cuba and the Dutch and Belgians cover short-term credit (i.e., up to 180 days)only. The French have however told us that they are under pressure from theirexporters to insure normal credit in order to meet British competition.15. The United States reacted strongly against the sale of Leyland buses toCuba, and they can be expected to react even more strongly against any further extension of medium-term credit to Cuba; and the fact that the Castro regime ispursuing a policy of active subversion in Latin America will make it much moredifficult for us to answer the inevitable criticism. We are already at odds with the americans over our economic relations with Cuba and. while the United StatesGovernment has so far taken only very limited measures against our interests, the pressure of Congressional opinion against countries which continue to trade withthe Castro regime is increasing and we cannot rely on the United states administration to protect us from Congressional measures (particularly in an election year) if it appears that we are giving Cuba financial help.Conclusions16. The majority of the Departments represented on the Export GuaranteeCommittee consider that a less restrictive credit insurance policy towards Cubawould be justified. They recognise that there is no clear indication of an absenceof economic risk on Cuba and that her hopes of recovery from recent setbackscould be frustrated by political or economic changes arising from her virtuallycomplete dependence on the Soviet bloc. However at present she has a substantialincome in convertible currencies (including sterling arising from the presentimbalance in trade with the United Kingdom), which will be spent on imports,from other countries if not from the United Kingdom. The Committee also recognised the political difficulties in the course proposed. However, they consider(the Bank of England dissenting) that E.C.G.D. should be authorised to extendcover as in paragraph 18 below.17. The Bank of England are opposed to the resumption of medium-termcover, mainly on the grounds that there is nothing to indicate that Cuba is sufficiently creditworthy. They believe that Cuba&apos;s debt to Russia continues toincrease, that her reserves are negligible, and that both the short and long-termtrading prospects are doubtful. They point out also that the Cubans have defaultedon their obligation to repay a drawing of $25 million from the I.M.F. made in1958, and do not appear to have the resources to repay. They agree that the tradearrears are being met reasonably satisfactorily. The Bank of England maintain that medium-term cover should at least be conditional upon the Cubans&apos; being prepared to open negotiations for a settlement of the outstanding debts to Shell(paragraphs 8 and 9 above).18. When the contract for the sale of buses by Leylands was underconsideration the Chancellor expressed the view that in trade matters we shouldtreat Cuba exactly like any member of the Soviet bloc We have a considerable interest in maintaining normal trade with all members of the Soviet bloc, and ministers have stated repeatedly that we should not discriminate in trade betweenthe bloc and other countries. On this basis, and provided that the inherent risksare accepted as reasonable, the Export Guarantee Committee (the Bank of Englanddissenting from (b)) propose that E.C.G.D. should be authorised to give Section 2cover as follows:(a) short-term business (up to six months&apos; post-shipment credit) on normalterms and(b) medium, and extended term business (up to five years&apos; post-shipmentcredit), subject to an annual limit of  4 million on the Department^liabilities for firm business and offers.
