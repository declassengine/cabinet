CONFIDENTIALTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(83) 17 COPY NO 8114 June 1983CABINETTHE QUEEN&apos;S SPEECH ON THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENTMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilI attach a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament inthe form in which it has been agreed by the Queen&apos;s Speeches and FutureLegislation Committee (QL).    The text will have to be submitted toThe Queen on Thursday 16 June.2. The draft takes as its starting point our Manifesto and the legislative Iprogramme provisionally agreed by the Cabinet on 14 April.    It also takesaccount of the Bills which fell at the Dissolution.   We shall have toreconsider the legislative programme in the light of events since April,and so the draft Speech does not seek to mention every measure which mightbecome part of the programme but only measures which we can now see willclearly be introduced.3. There are a number of points which I should draw to the attention ofmy colleagues -a. The reference to Hong Kong in paragraph 5 is designed toreassure opinion there about the firmness of the Government&apos;scommitment.b. Paragraph 12 does not refer specifically to measures forthe introduction of private finance into British Airways andthe National Bus Company, since such measures were not amongthe programme provisionally agreed by the Cabinet in April.But the wording of the paragraph is general enough to coversuch measures if the Cabinet later decides to include themin the revised programme.c. It is envisaged that legislation to abolish the GreaterLondon Council and the Metropolitan County Councils will beintroduced in the second Session of this Parliament.Paragraph 18 is not intended to imply a Bill in this Session.d. The Secretary of State for Education and Science has askedthat the second sentence in paragraph 24 should be placed insquare brackets; he wishes to explain to the Cabinet the tacticalproblem which it raises.    QL thought that if the sentence is toremain in the Speech it would need to be clarified.1CONFIDENTIALI f &quot;
CONFIDENTIAL4. I shall submit proposals later for the full legislative programmefor the Session.    Meanwhile, we need to introduce a number of Billsquickly so as to make the best use of Parliamentary time before theSummer Adjournment.    The only Bills which are likely to be readyimmediately are some of the Bills which fell at the Dissolution, someessential Bills and some Second Reading Committee Bills.    The introductionof such Bills would not pre-empt future decisions on the programme asa whole.5. I invite my colleagues to approve the draft Speech attached to thismemorandum, and to agree to the introduction of Bills in the categoriesmentioned in the preceding paragraph as soon as they are ready.W WPrivy Council Office14 June 19832CONFIDENTIAL1 _ i ,
