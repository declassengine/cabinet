The foundations have been laid for sustainable growth andemployment.without a resurgence of inflation.    Our decisions now and inthe coming months will determine the outcome of this Parliament.2.

World Economy.    Since &lt;^^udget the prospects for the rest of theworld economy have in some fv2 W^s deteriorated.    Although output isgrowing strongly in the UniteV^^^s the fiscal and monetary positionthere looks anything but health^v^Phe very high budget deficit is acause for particular concern.    ^wu&gt;d be unwise to count on theUnited States deficit being reduce^nuliX below $200 billion in thenext year or two, even assuming some^H^miing of tax and expenditurePlans.    Recovery in Europe and Japan&lt;^fsXpelatively slow.    The overallrate of growth in the major industrial:^^^):ries, perhaps some 3 per centnext year, seems likely to be weak compa^M^tp past cycles. Thegeographically narrow base of the recovetVvimplies that the upturn inworld trade will be relatively modest by p^t standards, particularly^because of the depressed state of markets both in the non-oil developingcountries and in the Organisation for Petroleum Exporting Countries.Manufacturing trade, which fell 3 per cent last v^a5\ should rise4 per cent next year.    So far recovery is under w^ay vithout much upwardpressure on inflation (inflation in the major sev^/ *Jt^ tries averagesbelow 5 per cent), though some continuing rise in n^n^o^k commodityprices, from generally very low levels, is to be expec^e^^ Recovery isbeing assisted by the general consensus in favour of rei^^ible monetaryand fiscal policies.    The French demonstration of the p)^ ^5\pf trying tospend and borrow one&apos;s way out of recession has proved an ej^ientwarning.4. Output.    Despite the slower growth in world trade our owTV^&amp;jyjhnow looks a little higher than the Budget forecast - perhaps 2ls\grf^entthis year, mainly led by buoyant consumer spending and some welco^/V&gt;increased spending by companies on stocks and fixed investment. i^jX^ei-n consumer spending reflects a significant reduction in the savings^/^/^  ICONFIDENTIAtl %\

At the same time company profits have been recovering^V\\      and are expected to continue to benefit from lower increases in labour^v^U   costs, with smaller earnings increases and continued rapid productivityr^^^X growth in manufacturing, as well as the reduction in the National&lt;\^J)JInsurance Surcharge.    The balance of payments current account is moving^^fhis year from substantial surplus into rough balance (though the figures&lt;^Jf , as always,  subject to wide margins of error).    The change since the\&gt;^Met reflects firmer non-oil commodity prices this year and a fasterEy^tkof demand in the United Kingdom, relative to the rest of the world.5. &lt;/fn/J&gt;984 , slower growth of domestic demand may be broadly offset bya fas e^ ise in world demand, producing another year of steady 2-2. per cent!growttfr-vX^is will be helpful to the prospect for unemployment.    I do notexpect a^y^Efijor change from current levels for the rest of this year, andthe prospNVts thereafter continue to depend on containing labour costs,improving competitiveness and seeing recovery in the rest of the world.6- Prices.     Thes-e are now rising more slowly than at any time sincethe 1960s;    and(^ne|Vrospects for inflation have actually improved a littlesince March.    Aus^e^id of  1983, despite the rise in the mortgage rate,the Retail Price lMex)jshould still be only some 5i per cent higher thana year earlier as a^ptsl 6 per cent forecast at the time of the Budget.This, along with . the &lt; y^  Nl realisation that there are good prospectsfor low inflation in Ifii^VVdll help the recovery.7- The figures in the m^^^cent Treasury forecast are shown in theattached table. \Cs)/\RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES8.     There are, however, still sorh^sTgnificant risks and uncertainties. .9- The major overseas uncertainty&lt;^is^nited States interest rates andthe problem of the enormous United Sl&lt;^e^)&gt;udget deficit. Continuinghigh real United States interest ratesWj&amp;lA be very worrying, and the spressure is undoubtedly for them to riseV^till further.    It is, therefore,all the more important that our policiesN^iould aim to establish conditionsin which we can distance ourselves somewhat from what happens in theUnited States.      Oil prices, on the other hand, seem to have stabilised,and there is a good prospect of a steady reducti* S^i.n the real oil pricein the next two years, the more so if the dollafr(we&lt;c7e to fall.Political disturbances amongst the oil producing^^iTtries could alwaysPush up oil prices in the short term;   but, that d^ptt^there does not atPresent look to be much risk of a major oil price inc^e^se.10- At home recent financial developments have exhibl^^^KPrryingfeatures.    Money supply in the first four months of the tar^t. periodhas been increasing at an annual rate of around 17 per cew ^yme wayabove the 7-11 per cent target.    Public expenditure and bor^9^c, havealso been well above the levels envisaged at the time of the ^VW^ andthreaten our hopes of lower interest rates.    With our decisioft^JwO7 July we set about correcting this, but continued vigilance wiC^i^&gt;needed if we are to keep on track.    And, of course, pay in the pu^^icVN^sector will require our continuing attention. &lt;//&gt;,_       &apos; %\I CONFIDENTIAL I
mmmp) IconfidentialI HIMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY11.      Over the past four years we have followed a responsible andconsistent monetary and fiscal policy within the framework set by ther^^/\Medium ierm financial Strategy.    The results can be seen in low\V^)J-nflation - the lowest for fifteen years - and welcome signs of recovery,--/^ead of most other countries.    The task now is to consolidate and\\vP/\0ve on these gains.^//yy&apos;Ae. will continue to operate economic policy flexibly, as in thepaW^f^Vr years.    But there remains a firm, overriding requirement tomaiit&gt;^lT)/ he monetary conditions needed to keep downward pressure onlnrIa^^^r-end to support this by firm control over public spending andborrow5?v y/ That is the only way in which we can keep the confidence offinancia^/rarVkets,  secure the conditions for better output and jobs, andlook forward to reversing the trend in unemployment.    We are determinedto bring atrout a smaller public sector.    And it is particularly importantnow the recovery is under way that we do not let the public sector crowdout investment in^the private sector.]3.      But that wU^/tmsly some difficult decisions.    The steps we havejust taken on pub Iff expendi ture this year have helped with the immediate ..problem, but the marJd^Oa r e understandably suspending judgment until theysee how we tackle the&lt;^r^pmt round of public expenditure decisions, thefirst of this Parliamei{^^^&apos;4.      The budgetary prospe&lt; ^^&amp;r next year is no an easy one.    At the time f the Budget we were anticipating a small positive fiscal adjustmentof around ii, billion in l98^S5^\SBut since then the scope for tax&apos; cutsnext year has receded.    The h^riTO&gt;jp r room for manouvre is being squeezedbetween lower revenue projection^&lt;partly because inflation is turning outa little lower than we had expectsjfo^od continuing upward pressure onPublic expenditure.    Of course, ar tbj^&amp;^stage, the figures are subjectto a wide margin of error.    But the&apos;^fmp^Siate tax prospect looks distinctlyuncomfortable.    The conclusion is cle^S-^Tthe most we can afford is tokeep to the expenditure plans in the faS^%Tpite Paper for 1984-85 onwards.Even then there will be a risk that tax&amp;^Hay still have to be put upnext year if we are to keep to the MediumoTerm Financial Strategy.15.     As the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper (C(83)  23)  illustrates we had noalternative but to allow taxes to rise during thenarly years of the lastarliament.  In this Parliament we must continue^pie)Jtrend towards lowertaxation started in the last two Budgets. This r^DmjSNjust a matter of meetingB,?Ur commitments.    We also want a better-structuredf(taxysystem. Taxation&apos;is the key to individual incentive, to risk takingNiW^Lc. securing the&apos;md of change in attitudes needed to bring about a moV^^namic,competitive and enterprising economy.    Tax reform mustM5^vA\a high priority.And we are agreed that without lower taxes we shall not get&gt;(jigher growth.Securing conditions for lasting growth is also the ke^jxymore jobs.ls now generally recognised that there is no quick or easY/^sT&gt;^ionto unemployment and no simple trade-off between inflation andN^n^ippSLoyment.e 0nly route to higher employment, on a lasting basis, is thr^W/&gt;ower inflation, lower costs and higher productivity.    Lower taxa^dnVs^s anecessary and vital part of this. &lt;\//&gt; MmM^ IcomfidentialI I
