SECTION I: INTRODUCTION1.1 This White Paper covers the period of the German Presidency ofthe Council of Ministers from 1 January to 30 June 1983. This was a busyperiod, during which further progress was made in the development of theCommunity.1.2 The European Council in Stuttgart on 17-19 June launched a majornegotiation on the reform of the Community&apos;s financial system. Key issueswhich this negotiation will address are how to ensure better budgetarydiscipline and effective control of agricultural and other Communityexpenditure; how to ensure a more equitable sharing of the burden offinancing the Community budget; and the Community&apos;s requirements in termsof own resources, taking into account the accession of Spain and Portugaland future Community action in other fields. The negotiation will beconducted at special meetings of the Council and the results are to besubmitted to the Athens European Council on 6 December. The full text ofthe Stuttgart declaration on these subjects is at Annex E.1.3 The European Council agreed on the British budget refund for 1983.This is to be some  437 million, and the agreement means that over the fouryears 1980-83 the United Kingdom will have received net refunds of morethan  2,500 million-almost two-thirds of our net contributions. This wasthe intended proportion in the first refund agreement on 30 May 1980.1.4 The Declaration on European Union was also signed at Stuttgart.The Government supports the Declaration as a reaffirmation of the Com-munity&apos;s democratic and political objectives and of its longer term aims.1.5 The six month period &apos;saw the completion of work and agreementon action by the Community in a number of other areas of importance tothe United Kingdom.1.6 In the social and employment sphere, agreement was reached on newrules for the European Social Fund, providing for at least 75 per cent of theFund to be used specifically for schemes for young people. The UnitedKingdom should be a major beneficiary from these provisions, which will helpcombat youth unemployment. A Directive on the protection of workers fromexposure to asbestos was also agreed, as was a Resolution on vocationaltraining policies in the 1980s. In the regional field, the Community&apos;srecognition of the special economic and social problems of Northern Irelandwas demonstrated by the adoption of a Regulation providing assistance forurban renewal projects in Belfast, which will bring welcome extra money tothe Province.1.7 On fisheries, after a long and difficult negotiation, agreement wasreached on 25 January, on a revised common policy for the management ofthe Community&apos;s fishing resources which it is intended should apply for aperiod of at least twenty years. In the annual agricultural price-fixing, for thefirst time for many years, there was no increase in the agreed overall levelof common prices as compared with the original Commission proposals.4
The weighted average increase for prices on a Community basis was 4 . 1 percent and for the United Kingdom 3 ? 8 per cent.  This was very much at the_ insistence of the United Kingdom.1.8 On environmental issues, an important development was formalCommunity action to prevent trade in certain seal pup skins and products,which were already the subject of a voluntary ban in the United Kingdomand some other member states. This takes the form of a Directive providingfor a two-year ban on imports from 1 October 1983 unless further studies orcontacts with sealing countries render this unnecessary. The Government&apos;sapproach in discussion of this question took into account the opinionsexpressed from both sides of the House of Commons during the Debate onseals on 16 February. Agreement was also reached during the period on aDirective to assist control of cadmium discharges on terms which safeguardthe United Kingdom&apos;s practice in water pollution control.1.9 On the external side, the Government welcomed a unilateraldecision by Spain to reduce tariffs on some Community car imports. TheCommunity concluded an agreement with Japan restraining exports to theCommunity in certain sensitive sectors in 1983; and formally sought theestablishment of a working party under the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (GATT) to examine its complaint about access to the Japanesemarket.   The Japanese Government announced a series of measures toease testing and similar requirements for imports of various manufactures.The Community also held useful talks with the United States about theproblems which have arisen over agricultural trade, and made strongrepresentations to the United States Government about proposals to amendthe US Export Administration Act which would involve applying extrater-ritorial jurisdiction in the field of export control.   Voluntary restraintarrangements were concluded with 14 countries to cover trade in steel.Imports from countries which have not concluded voluntary restraint Iarrangements are subject to a system of basic import reference prices.  The IGovernment will work with the Commission in the operation of these Imeasures so as to minimise damaging disruption to the Community&apos;s steel Imarkets by imports from third countries.1.10 There was considerable activity in political co-operation over the Iperiod, particularly in the Conference on Security and Co-operation in IEurope (CSCE), where the Ten co-operated closely on tactics and strategy. IThe Community continued to harmonise policy on other major international Iproblems, notably the Middle East.1.11 The Community participated actively in the work of the IOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) leading Ito the extension of the OECD Consensus on guidelines for officially supported Iexport credits and the OECD Understanding on export credits for ships until I30 June 1983 and 31 July 1983 respectively. Within the Community, a ICouncil Decision to amend the rules for provision of insurance cover and Ifinance for sub-contracts in other member states became effective on I1 January 1983, bringing other countries into line with the United Kingdom. I1.12 In a number of other areas, work was set in hand or new initiatives Iwere taken during the period.____
1.13 The Government, jointly with the German and Dutch Governments,introduced a memorandum proposing a concerted Community approachtowards the elimination of lead in petrol, and placed on record its own .determination to move as rapidly as possible to unleaded petrol.1.14 The Commission introduced detailed proposals for a new solidfuels strategy and a five year Community energy programme. The proposalson solid fuels were particularly welcomed by the Government, both ascontributing to meeting the Community&apos;s energy objectives of reduceddependence on imported oil and efficient use of energy, and as helping toredress the present imbalance in the Community&apos;s budget.1.15 There was considerable activity on trade questions during thisperiod, reflecting the importance of the Community in this area. IntensiveI work began on a Commission proposal to strengthen the Community&apos;s abilityto take defensive action against the unjustifiable trading practices of others.The period also saw the first four meetings of a Council of Ministers devotedexclusively to internal market issues. The Government welcomed thisinitiative towards speeding up the process of making the free movement ofgoods and services within the Community&apos;s very large internal market morecomplete. In the services sector, however, progress was disappointing,particularly on the proposed non-life insurance directive, which is still farfrom completion.1.16 The Community began to prepare its position for the negotiationswith the African, Caribbean and Pacific states on a successor agreement tothe current (second) Lome Convention. These negotiations are expected tobegin later in 1983.1.17 Other areas in which final decisions have yet to be taken include theI accession negotiations with Spain and Portugal. These have continued toI move more slowly than the Government had hoped, not least because theI absence of agreement within the Community on the reform of the marketI regimes for certain Mediterranean agricultural products has held up progressI on the agricultural aspect of the accession negotiations.1.18 Work continued during the period on the drawing up of a newI regulation to govern the operation of the Community&apos;s Regional Develop-I went Fund and on a new system of quota shares. The United KingdomI pressed strongly for the Fund to be concentrated more in future on areasI of greatest need and on the less prosperous member states.SECTION II:  POLITICAL CO-OPERATIONI Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)2.1 The Ten have continued to work closely together in the CSCEI at Madrid to maintain Western unity and to bring the meeting to a satis-I factory outcome. In response to the tabling of a revised draft final documentI by the Neutral and Non-Aligned Participants in the meeting, the Ten, withI the other Western Allies, proposed a limited list of reasonable and essential6
amendments. In June the European Council noted with interest thesubsequent initiative taken by the Spanish Prime Minister and reiteratedtheir view that the adoption of a substantial and balanced concludingdocument by the Madrid meeting would register progress on the humandimension, open the way to a Conference on Disarmament in Europe, givea fresh impetus to the CSCE process and make a useful contribution tothe improvement of East-West relations as a whole.Middle East2.2 In March the European Council reaffirmed their support for thesovereignty and independence of Lebanon, and called for the withdrawalof all foreign forces. The Council also noted that President Reagan&apos;sinitiative had indicated a way to a comprehensive peace, and called on thevarious parties to the dispute to play their part in the region, in particularthe Palestinian people and the Palestine Liberation Organisation by declaringthemselves in favour of negotiations and Israel by refraining from enlargingexisting settlements or creating new ones.2.3 Following the signing of the Israel-Lebanon agreement, theEuropean Council in June decided that the Community would resumefinancial co-operation with Israel. The Ten emphasised, however, thatpeace would not become a reality unless the security and legitimate interestsof the other States and peoples of the region were taken into account, andstated their readiness to use all means at their disposal to support theefforts of the parties in question to find a broader area of agreement. TheCouncil also expressed its serious concern at the distress of the Palestinianpopulation in Lebanon. This concern had already been made known incontacts with the Israel and Lebanon Governments.Poland2.4 The Ten continued to follow developments in Poland closely. InJune the European Council reaffirmed their conviction that only a nationalreconciliation, taking into full account the aspirations of the Polish people,could lead the country out of its grave crisis.Central America2.5 The Ten consulted closely on the crisis in Central America. Theyagreed that the problems of the region could not be solved by militarymeans but required a political solution springing from the region itself.They therefore made clear their support for the initiative of the ContadoraGroup (which brings together Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico and Panamain work to solve Central American problems). They also expressed theirreadiness to continue contributing to further development in the area inorder to promote progress towards stability.Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)2.6 The close relations between the European Community (EC) andASEAN were further cemented by the EC/ASEAN ministerial meetingwhich took place in Bangkok in March. The two sides consulted on arange of major international problems and were able to record a close
similarity of view, in particular on the questions of Cambodia andAfghanistan.South Africa2.7 The Ten discussed the results of the third round of reports bycompanies with subsidiaries in South Africa on the implementation of theEC Code of Conduct. They agreed that the Code was an important factorin the continuing improvement in the working and living conditions ofblack Africans employed by the South African subsidiaries of Europeancompanies. They emphasised the great importance they attached toimproving the working and living conditions of black African workers andcalled for further progress towards achievement of the guidelines set outin the Code.Co-operation in Third Countries2.8 The Ten agreed to review the state of co-operation among theirdiplomatic missions in third countries with a view to intensifying andextending it. Areas which will be examined include greater exchanges ofinformation, shared infrastructure, and co-operation on consular, information,cultural and development matters.SECTION III:   ENLARGEMENT, EXTERNAL RELATIONS,TRADE AND AIDEnlargement3.1 Agreement was reached with Spain on taxation. Further progresswas made with Spain on technical aspects of the customs union, coal andsteel and external relations chapters and with Portugal on harmonisation oflaws and external relations.European Free Trade Association (EFTA)3.2 Alternative simplified Rules of Origin for EC /EFTA trade coveringChapter Headings 84-92 of the Customs Co-operation Council Nomenclature(CCCN) came into operation on 1 April for an initial three year period.The Community held meetings with Austria, Switzerland, Finland and Icelandon a wide range of trade issues under the terms of its free trade agreementswith these countries.General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)3.3 The Community contributed to the establishment of a broadly basedwork programme to implement the decisions taken at the GATT MinisterialMeeting last November.Sixth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD VI)3.4 The Community played a full part both in the preparations for and atthe Sixth Conference which considered a wide range of economic, financial,trade and commodity issues.8
Euro-Arab Dialogue3.5 A symposium on relations between the two civilisations was held inHamburg on 11-15 April.Spain3.6 In March, Spain made a unilateral offer to the Community to openreduced duty tariff quotas of 19 per cent for 5,000 Community cars between1300cc and 1600cc and of 25 per cent for 10,000 Community cars between2000cc and 2600cc. These quotas, which are of particular interest to theUnited Kingdom motor industry, were formally announced on 24 June andwill be renewed annually.Poland3.7 Disbursement of the 9-5 million ecu (about  5-4 million)* inhumanitarian aid agreed last December continued throughout the six months.A further proposal is under consideration.Argentina3.8 Two further rounds of talks between the Community and repre-sentatives of the Argentine Government took place on 13 and 31 May aimedat initiating discussion of the reciprocal lifting of the remaining restrictionson civil commercial relations. The Argentine authorities have not so faragreed to enter into formal discussions. Both sides have agreed to remainin contact.Yugoslavia3.9 The first meeting of the EC/Yugoslavia Co-operation Council washeld on 24 May. The meeting was chaired by Mr Mojsov, the YugoslavForeign Minister. The Council approved a decision to expand economicco-operation, and the two sides exchanged views on commercial and labouraffairs.3.10 European Economic Community (EEC) and European Coal andSteel Community (ECSC) Agreements with Yugoslavia containing preferentialand co-operation provisions formally entered into force on 1 April, havingbeen ratified by all Contracting Parties. The EEC/Yugoslavia Agreementreplaces the Interim Agreement of 1980.United States of America3.11 Proposals for the renewal of the United States Export Admini-stration Act provided the Community with opportunities to renew itsrepresentations against the attempted exercise by the United States ofextraterritorial jurisdiction in the field of export controls. There were alsouseful contacts with the United States on problems in agricultural trade.Japan3.12 The Foreign Affairs Council endorsed an agreement negotiatedbetween the Commission and the Japanese Government for restraint in1983 in exports to the Community in certain sensitive sectors, notablycolour televisions and tubes and video tape recorders.* Converted at 1 June market rate of 1 -77 ecu =  1.93149222 b*
3.13 Meanwhile, responding to pressure from the Community forfurther elimination of import barriers, the Japanese Government announceda series of measures to ease testing and similar requirements for variousmanufactures. The Community formally requested the establishment ofa GATT working party to adjudicate on its claim over problems of accessto the Japanese market.Textiles3.14 The Community&apos;s new bilateral agreements with the supplyingcountries under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement and unilateral measures inrespect of certain other countries came into force on 1 January. TheCommission took action on 9 March to stem the very high flow of certaintextile and clothing imports from Turkey. Discussions between the Com-mission and Turkey are continuing in an effort to seek to establish anacceptable voluntary regime for Turkish exports of textiles and clothingto the Community.Internal Market3.15 The newly-convened Internal Market Council met four times,on 1 February, 1 March, 26 May and 21 June, to discuss the package ofpriority measures for completion of the internal market which was putforward by the European Council in December 1982. A Directive ontechnical regulations and standards (83/189) was adopted on 28 March.The Directive is designed to prevent member states erecting new technicalbarriers to trade by requiring them to declare at an early stage theirintentions to draft standards or draw up technical regulations over thewhole area of industrial products. Where a potential technical barrier totrade is detected, member states will be requested to suspend work for alimited period on the particular document in question to enable efforts tobe made to alleviate the problem. Agreement was also reached onDirectives on the taxation of temporarily imported vehicles and of permanentimports of personal property, in particular wedding gifts, as well as onother minor issues to ease frontier formalities. Community certificationof products from third countries was a key issue which is still unresolved.Other issues discussed but not resolved include the new Common Com-mercial Policy Regulation designed to combat illicit trading practices bynon-member countries, a single administrative document for customsformalities, duty relief for professional effects imported for temporary usein another member state, marketing of pharmaceuticals, textile labelling,product liability, insurance, industrial innovation and a postponed accountingsystem for import value added tax (VAT) of intra-Community goods.Steel3.16 The Community concluded voluntary restraint arrangements onsteel imports with Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Australia, Japan,South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,Poland and Romania, and with Brazil on pig-iron.10
Lome Convention3.17 The Foreign Affairs Council gave preliminary consideration tothe mandate for negotiations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP)states on the successor to the current (second) Lome Convention. Negotia-tions with the ACP are due to begin later this year. On 19-20 May theannual ACP-European Community Council of Ministers met to reviewprogress on aid and trade co-operation, and a special ACP-EuropeanCommunity Council to discuss the Stabex scheme was held on 19 May.Food Aid3.18 The 14 June Development Council gave preliminary considerationto a Commission food aid policy paper which proposed measures tointegrate Community food aid more closely with the development policiesof recipient countries. The Community food aid programme for 1983 wasagreed at the 21 June Foreign Affairs Council.Regulation for a Special Programme to Combat Hunger in the World3.19 The 14 June Development Council considered a draft regulationto implement a special programme intended to combat hunger in the world(Article 958 of the Budget). On 9 May the House of Commons debatedthe draft and approved a motion welcoming the Government&apos;s efforts tosecure improvements to it.Lebanon3.20 The 14 March Foreign Affairs Council agreed on special recon-struction aid to Lebanon of 20 million ecus ( 11-3 million)* for a watersupply project for Beirut.SECTION IV: AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESThe Common Agricultural Policy price fixing4.1 The Commission&apos;s proposals for common prices in 1983-84 werepublished in December 1982 and a settlement reached at the AgricultureCouncil on 17 May. The settlement represents a net addition to theCommunity budget of 435 million ecus ( 246 million)* in 1983 and745 million ecus ( 421 million)* in 1984. The weighted average increase forprices on a Community basis was 4 . 1 per cent and for the United Kingdom3-8 per cent. The direct effect of the settlement over a full year will be toadd about 0 . 1 per cent to the retail price index and about 0 . 5 per cent tothe food price index.4.2 The target price for milk was increased by 2-33 per cent reflecting adeduction from the &quot; norm &quot; to contribute towards the cost of disposing ofdeliveries to dairies in excess of the 1982 guarantee threshold. The 1983threshold was fixed at 0-5 per cent above that for 1982 and it was agreed I* Converted at 1 June market rate of 1-77 ecu= l.11&apos;3149222 B*2
that if this was exceeded the Commission should again propose appropriatemeasures to offset the additional expenditure. The basic co-responsibilitylevy was maintained at 2 per cent of the target price. 120 million ecus(about  68 million)* was again made available for distribution amongmember states to support the incomes of small producers; the UnitedKingdom will receive 7 million ecus (about  4 million)*. The consumerbutter subsidy was increased from 450 ecus ( 278 per tonne)t to 510 ecusper tonne ( 315 per tonne)t, and in the United Kingdom continues to bewholly financed by the Community. The Council agreed certain improve-ments to the school milk arrangements, including the abolition of therequirement for a national contribution and a corresponding increase in theCommunity subsidies.4.3 The guide and intervention prices for beef were increased by5-5 per cent. The premium schemes were continued unaltered but theCommission will review all premiums in the beef sector and report to theCouncil by 1 August 1983 on their operation. No change was made to thesystem of price reporting but the Council ordered that work should continueon the Community carcase classification grid with a view to applying it tointervention buying from 1 January 1984.4.4 For sheepmeat, the basic price and therefore the guide level used forcalculating variable premiums paid to producers of fat sheep when marketprices fall below the guide level rose by 5-5 per cent; the reference priceused for calculating annual premium paid as a headage payment on ewes roseby 9 . 8 per cent, including a further transitional alignment step. A slaughterrule, requiring all sheep certified for variable premium to be slaughteredor exported within 21 days of the date of certification, was adopted at theManagement Committee on 10 June, to come into force on 1 August.4.5 The pigmeat basic price was increased by 5 . 5 per cent and a specialaid of nearly  6 million was allocated to finance pigmeat processing projectsin the United Kingdom submitted under the terms of Regulation 355/77.The basis for the calculation of monetary compensatory amounts (mcas) inthe pigmeat sector will be altered with effect from 1 August; as a result mcaswill be reduced by 10 per cent.4.6 The support price for feed grains was increased by three per centand for breadmaking wheat by 2-5 per cent, reflecting the operation of theguarantee threshold scheme introduced at the 1982-83 price fixing. Some2-3 million tonnes of cereals from Intervention stocks will be made availablefor use in animal feed, of which 50,000 tonnes will be transferred to NorthernIreland.4.7 The basic sugar beet price and the white sugar intervention pricewere increased by 4 per cent.4.8 The production target price and intervention price for rapeseed wereincreased by 4 per cent, reflecting the operation of the guarantee thresholdarrangements introduced in 1982-83.* Converted at 1 June market rate of 1-77 ecu= l.t Converted at green rate of 1-62 ecu= l.12
4.9 In January following a fall in the market value of the drachma theGreek representative rate used for converting Community agricultural supportprices into the national currency was devalued. In April the representativerates for Belgium and Luxembourg were valued at parity with the new centralrates arising out of the March realignment of currencies in the EuropeanMonetary System (EMS). The price fixing settlement in May includedrevaluations of the representative rates for Germany and the Netherlands anddevaluations for France, Ireland, Italy and Greece. In June the representativerates for Ireland, Belgium and Luxembourg were devalued to parity withthe new central rates arising from the May EMS realignment and a two stagedevaluation of the representative rate for wine for France was agreed.Butter-New Zealand4.10 At the Agriculture Council on 14-15 March, France and the IrishRepublic lifted their reserves on the implementation of the provisions for theimport of 87,000 tonnes of butter from New Zealand in 1983. Regulationshad previously been adopted for imports of New Zealand butter into theUnited Kingdom in January, February and March and the Council thenadopted a Regulation authorising the United Kingdom to import 65,250tonnes of butter for the remaining nine months of 1983.Animal Feedingstuffs4.11 The Agriculture Council on 18 April agreed a Directive (83/228)which lays down guidelines for compiling dossiers for applications for newproducts to be included in the Annex to the certain products (single cellproteins and yeasts) used in animal nutrition (Directive 82/471).Food Contaminants4.12 The Foreign Affairs Council agreed on 25-26 April a Directivespecifying an agreed list of materials to be used for manufacturingregenerated cellulose film intended to come into contact with foodstuffs.Grants for Marketing and Processing4.13 The Agriculture Council agreed in May (as noted in paragraph 4.5)a special allocation of 10 million ecus (nearly  6 million)* for the developmentof the United Kingdom&apos;s pig processing industry. The aid will be given in1983 and 1984 under the grants for projects to improve the marketing andprocessing of agricultural and fisheries products.European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)4.14 Under the Guarantee section of the EAGGF, United Kingdomreceipts during the period were  483 million, the main areas of benefit beingpayments for export refunds on cereals, milk and beef, oilseed productionaids, skimmed milk aids, butter subsidies and beef and sheepmeat premiums.United Kingdom receipts from the Guidance section of the EAGGF amountedto  11 million during the period with  6 million for direct (project type)measures, and  5 million for non marketing of milk.* Converted at 1 June market rate of 1-77 ecu =  1.13
Animal Health and Welfare4.15 Discussions continued on Commission proposals for a directivelaying down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens kept inbattery cages.Meat Hygiene4.16 Council Directive 64/433 lays down rules for the hygienic productionof fresh meat for intra-Community trade, and Directive 72/462 applies similarrules to imports from third countries. The Agriculture Council on 7 Februaryadopted extensive amendments to both Directives, updating the hygienerequirements and allowing for greater freedom of trade by reducing the scopefor importing countries to apply their own national rules.Fisheries-Internal Regime4.17 Agreement was reached at the Fisheries Council on 25 Januaryon a comprehensive Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). It provides for newarrangements of access to existing waters which will apply for a periodof at least 20 years, and includes a system for the allocation of catchquotas among member states within each area&apos;s total allowable catch(TAC). It was agreed that fishing activity will be carried out in accordancewith the TACs and quotas belatedly set for 1982 until the Council approvesthe 1983 levels. A permanent conservation Regulation was also adoptedlaying down certain technical conservation measures. It prescribes minimummesh sizes, by-catch rates, minimum fish sizes and prohibits fishing withincertain areas and periods and with certain gear, for the protection of fishinggrounds and stocks. A Resolution was also adopted recording a CouncilDecision to make EC funding available for the next three years for a numberof schemes designed to adjust the capacity of the fleet and to improveproductivity, including grants for the building and modernizing of vessels,grants for removing vessels from the fleet and grants for temporarily layingthem up. Community measures to bring the schemes into effect were to beagreed within six months.4.18 At the Internal Market Council on 26 May a Regulation wasadopted, as a matter of urgency, permitting fishing by, and fixing provisionalquota allocations for, certain member states for herring stocks in the NorthSea.4.19 At the Fisheries Council on 20 June proposals for 1983 TACs andquotas and for amendments to the conservation Regulation were discussedbut no agreement was reached.4.20 At the Fisheries Council on 30 June, proposals for further interimallocations of North Sea herring for member states and for Norway wereconsidered, pending a Council decision on 1983 herring quotas. No agreementwas reached.Fisheries-External Regime4.21 Reciprocal fishing agreements with Norway, the Faroes, Sweden andSpain for 1983 were concluded and implemented. A trilateral agreement onthe regulation of fisheries in the Skagerrak and Kattegat was concludedbetween the Community, Norway and Sweden.14? ^^_____________
SECTION V:  ECONOMIC, MONETARY AND BUDGETARYQUESTIONSFinance Council Business5.1 Finance Ministers continued their regular reviews of the economicsituation in the Community. On 7 February the Finance Council discussedthe Commission&apos;s proposal to raise further loans under the New CommunityInstrument with a view to promoting investment in the Community.Ministers agreed that there should be an overall ceiling of 3 billionecus (about  1,691 million)* and that the release of individual tranchesshould be decided by qualified majority voting in the Council. Thisproposal was adopted at the April Finance Council and the ceiling of 1-5billion ecus (about  845 million)* for the first tranche was agreed at theJune Finance Council.5.2 At the 18 April Finance Council, agreement was reached on anoutline negotiating mandate for the Commission for the OECD negotiationson guidelines for export credit terms. Ministers also considered theirapproach to the Williamsburg economic summit.5.3 The 16 May Finance Council agreed that a loan for France of4 billion ecus (about  2,254 million)* should be made, using the CommunityLoan Facility; and approved the seventh Directive on the consolidatedaccounts of groups of undertakings.5.4 The 13 June Council had a substantial discussion on the draftnon-life insurance services directive.European Monetary System (EMS)5.5 Finance Ministers met on 26-28 March to agree an adjustmentof the central rates within the EMS. The Deutschemark was revaluedby 5-5 per cent, the Dutch florin by 3-5 per cent, the Danish krone by2-5 per cent and the Belgian franc by 1-5 per cent; the French franc andthe Italian lira were devalued by 2-5 per cent and the Irish punt wasdevalued by 3-5 per cent. A further adjustment to the notional centralrate for sterling in the EMS was made on 17 May 1983, based on themarket exchange rates of 13 May 1983.5.6 Sub-Committee A (Finance, Economics and Regional Policy) ofthe House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities havebeen investigating the European Monetary System.

It was debated in the Houseof Lords on 14 April 1983.* Converted at 1 June market rate of 1-77 ecu= l.15
Budget QuestionsSupplementary and amending budget No. 1 for 19835.8 In January the Commission presented the preliminary draft supple-mentary and amending budget No. 1 for 1983. An early supplementarybudget was needed this year because of the European Parliament&apos;s rejectionin December 1982 of the draft supplementary budget which would havemade provision for our basic refund for 1982 (see the previous White Paperin this series). The new supplementary budget, which the EuropeanParliament adopted unchanged on 10 February, made provision for extraexpenditure of 1,337 million ecus (about  773 million).* Its main purposewas to reinstate the United Kingdom&apos;s basic refund for 1982 of 1,092 millionecus gross (about  631 million).* This sum was now divided betweensupplementary measures in favour of the United Kingdom of 692 millionecus gross ( 400 million)* and special energy measures of 400 million ecus( 231 million).* The supplementary budget provided for a further 210million ecus ( 121 million)* of special energy measures for West Germany.This reflected the Council&apos;s agreement that West Germany should contributeonly half her normal financing share to the UK&apos;s refund.Refunds for 19825.9 The Commission published on 23 March its decisions on thedetailed allocation between public expenditure programmes and projects inthe United Kingdom of the basic refund of 1,092 million ecus (about  631million).* These decisions brought the cumulative total of gross refundreceipts since the conclusion of the first refunds agreement on 30 May 1980to  2,441 million. The net value of these receipts, after allowing for theUnited Kingdom&apos;s contribution towards them under the own resourcesfinancing arrangements, amounts to some  1,990 million. Payment of 90per cent of the  631 million was made at the end of March and the balanceis being paid later in the year.1984 Preliminary Draft Budget5.10 On 10 June the Commission presented the 1984 preliminary draftbudget. The budget totalled some 25,528 million ecus ( 15,766 million)!in payment appropriations and 28,620 million ecus ( 17,675 million)! incommitment appropriations. This represents an increase over 1983 of11-5 per cent in payment appropriations and 17-75 per cent in commitmentappropriations. (Note : the 1984 draft budget was established by the BudgetCouncil on 20 and 21 July and included full provision for the UnitedKingdom&apos;s 1983 refund.)Future Financing and the 1983 Refunds5.11 The 21-22 March European Council called on the Commission toput forward specific proposals on the future financing of the Community assoon as possible and on the Foreign Affairs Council to report conclusionson them to the June European Council.   It also called on the Council to* Converted at the 1 December 1982 rate of 1-73 ecu =  1.t Converted at 5 April, 1983 rate of 1-62 ecu =  1 (used by the Commission indrawing up the 1984 preliminary draft budget).16
mminclude in its report conclusions on the immediate budgetary problem facingthe United Kingdom and agreed that figures for United Kingdom compen-sation in respect of 1983 should be included in the 1984 draft budget.5.12 The Commission produced proposals on future financing in May.They proposed that the 1 per cent limit on the value added tax (VAT) takefrom member states be increased initially to 1-4 per cent, with provisionfor raising the new limit subsequently by further tranches of 0-4 per cent,subject to unanimous agreement in the Council and a three-fifths majorityof votes cast in the European Parliament, without the need for ratificationby national Parliaments. Under the Commission&apos;s proposals, part of theVAT would be paid according to a new financing key, based on shares ofagricultural production, economic profitability and relative prosperity. This&quot; modulated VAT &quot; would finance expenditure on the Common AgriculturalPolicy in excess of 33 per cent of the budget. The Foreign Ministersdiscussed these proposals as well as the question of the United Kingdom&apos;s1983 refunds at meetings in May and June.5.13 At the European Council on 17-19 June, it was agreed that theUnited Kingdom would receive a net refund of 750 million ecus ( 437million)* in respect of its contribution to the 1983 budget. The EuropeanCouncil confirmed that these refunds would be entered in the 1984 draftbudget. The European Council also reached agreement on a declaration onlong term budgetary reform. This said that negotiations would be takenforward urgently at special meetings of the Council. The results would besubmitted to the European Council on 6 December. The main issues fornegotiation would be greater budgetary discipline and effective control ofagricultural and other Community expenditure, measures to avoid theconstantly recurring problems of certain member states and to assure a moreequitable sharing of the burden of financing the budget, and the Community&apos;srevenue requirements, taking into account the accession of Spain andPortugal. Decisions were to be taken in common on all these issues. Thefull text of the Stuttgart declaration on these subjects is at Annex E.Court of Auditors and Financial Control5.14 The Court of Auditors published its annual report on the 1981accounts in the Official Journal of 31 December 1982. In May theEuropean Parliament granted a discharge to the Commission on theimplementation of the 1981 budget. The House of Commons debated theCourt Auditors&apos; 1981 annual report on 21 March 1983.5.15 At the European Council in June it was agreed that the Court ofAuditors would be asked to review the sound financial management ofCommunity activities and to submit a report by the end of 1983.Banking5.16 Swift progress was made on a Directive on consolidated super-vision of banking which was adopted by the Finance Council of 13 June.This Directive requires the banking supervisory authorities in member statesto supervise credit institutions (banks and other bodies which both take* Converted at 17 June 1983 rate of 1 ? 71 ecu =  1.173149222 c*
deposits and extend credit) on a consolidated basis, taking account of thebusiness of subsidiaries as well as the parent institution. It is required to beimplemented by the ten member states by 1 July 1985. The UnitedKingdom has long been a strong advocate of consolidated supervision and theBank of England makes use of this technique in its supervision of banks inthis country.Customs Union5.17 Work on harmonisation of customs and VAT legislation continued.As noted in paragraph 3.15, a number of proposals were discussed in theInternal Market Council. One Regulation and three Directives, all dealingwith relief from customs duty or VAT in various circumstances, wereadopted. The Regulation provides for a Community system of duty reliefsfor goods permanently imported from outside the Community; a parallelVAT Directive allows VAT relief in most cases. The two remainingDirectives deal with VAT relief on goods imported into one member statefrom another; the first deals with temporarily imported means of transport;the second with permanently imported personal property. Other proposalsdiscussed included the 14th VAT directive which would require memberstates to adopt a postponed accounting system for VAT on imports ofintra-Community goods and the proposal for a single administrative docu-ment for controlling exports, transit and imports of Community goods.5.18 Germany has still to agree to abolish the exemption from VATand excise duties on goods sold on board the &quot; butterships&quot; sailing onnon-landing cruises from North German ports despite a European Courtjudgment of July 1981. This has led the Commission to take infractionproceedings in a case now before the Court.5.19 The Commission put forward two draft directives concerning dutyand tax-free allowances for international travellers. One would put thecontinued supply of tax-free goods to intra-Community travellers on afirm legal basis, so resolving any doubts about the continuation of thistrade stemming from cases before the European Court. The other wouldmake various adjustments to the tax-free allowances for intra-Communitytravellers, increasing the value limit on goods not subject to a quantitativelimit from its present 210 ecus to 400 ecus over a three-year period, andthe wine limit from four litres to six litres. The value limit is currently 120, but the sterling equivalent of any future increase will depend on theconversion rate applied each year for customs purposes and on movementsin the currencies of other member states.Excise Duties5.20 Judgment was expected in July on the European Court proceedingsagainst the United Kingdom in which the Commission has alleged that theUnited Kingdom&apos;s duty structure discriminates in favour of home-producedbeer and against imported wine. The Court has been considering the casesince 1978 and gave an interim judgment in February 1980. A secondoral hearing took place on 15 March 1983 in Luxembourg, followingwhich the Advocate General gave an opinion in favour of the Commission.18
Export Credit5.21 The consolidated text of the OECD Consensus on guidelines for- officially supported export credits was adopted into Community law by aCouncil Decision on 21 February. The Decision was amended on 16 Mayto extend its application to 30 June 1983. A Council Decision of 1 Februaryextended the application of the OECD Understanding on export creditfor ships until 31 July 1983. The amended rules for the provision ofinsurance cover and finance for sub-contracts let to other Communitystates came into effect from 1 January.SECTION VI:   REGIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL AFFAIRSEuropean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC)6.1 The Commission set aside over  11 million for readaptation benefitsto be paid to United Kingdom redundant steelworkers under Article 56(2)of the Treaty of Paris. The amount set aside will help to fund schemes forearly retirement, retraining and income support administered by the Depart-ment of Trade and Industry.European Investment Bank (EIB): Loans6.2 EIB foreign currency loans totalling  287 million were approved tothe United Kingdom over the period.  107 million of this sum went to privateindustry, mainly in the Assisted Areas, and  180 million went to the publicsector for telecommunications, water supply, sewerage and electricity projects.Regional Policy6.3 The size of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for1983 is about  1,117 million, of which about  1,061 million was set aside forthe quota section. Allocations to the United Kingdom from the quota sectionfor 1983 grants to industry and infrastructure projects are  260 million.The United Kingdom also continues to benefit from the first round ofnon-quota measures for 1981-1985, from which the United Kingdom hasbeen allocated about  32 million. By the end of May 1983 the UnitedKingdom had received over  1,050 million from the Fund since it beganin 1975. Consideration was given during the period to Commission proposalsfor a second round of non-quota measures which would make a further  85million or so available to the United Kingdom for a second five-year periodbut no agreement was reached. Proposals for a new main Regulation govern-ing the operation of the ERDF are also being considered by member states.6.4 At the end of March the Commission presented its ideas forprogrammes intended to raise income levels and improve employmentopportunities in designated rural Mediterranean areas. If agreed theseproposals would involve expenditure of an additional 6,628 million ecus(about  3,745 million)* from the Community budget over 1985-1990, withItaly, Greece and France receiving 45 per cent, 38 per cent and 17 per cent* Converted at the 1 June market rate of 1-77 ecu =  1.193149222 c*2
respectively. Countries benefiting under the scheme would have to providematching funds. The Foreign Affairs Council has agreed to study formalproposals from the Commission as soon as these are submitted.Urban Renewal6.5 On 21 June the Foreign Affairs Council adopted a Regulation toprovide assistance for urban renewal in Northern Ireland. The Regulationenables assistance of 100 million ecus (about  56 million)* to be granted topublic infrastructure projects contributing to urban renewal in Belfast overthe three years 1983 to 1985. Support will cover a maximum of 70 per centof costs, and eligible projects include leisure and recreation facilities, roadsand transport schemes, and environmental improvements. The support isadditional to the volume of expenditure which would otherwise be allocatedfor urban renewal.Steel6.6 Following the agreement at the Informal Meeting of IndustryMinisters in November 1982 on the need to restore price stability, theCommission published non-mandatory guide prices for the main steel productswith effect from 1 January. These guide prices were revised upwards inApril and May to reflect a firming up of the market and the effects of theMarch currency realignments within the European Monetary System.6.7 On 25 April the Steel Council reviewed progress on restructuring andthe question of prolongation after 1 July of the mandatory quota arrange-ments under ECSC Article 58. On the latter, the Commission were askedto bring forward detailed proposals, taking account of restructuring alreadyaccomplished. The Steel Council reconvened on 21 June to consider theCommission proposals. The Council decided to prolong the quotas for onemonth to ensure market stability while detailed discussions continued atGovernment and industry level.Science and Technology Research6.8 The Research Council met three times, on 8 February, 10 March and28 June. Following consideration by the February Council of the activitiesof the Community&apos;s Joint Research Centre (JRC), the March Council agreedto cancel the JRC&apos;s Super Sara test programme on light-water nuclear reactorsafety on the grounds that it was not cost effective and duplicated workalready under way elsewhere. Following consideration at earlier Councils,the June Council reached agreement on the text of a Council Resolution toestablish a framework programme for Community research and development(R and D) for 1984-87. The June Council also agreed on proposals forevaluating and stimulating R and D potential; on the inclusion of work onuranium exploration/extraction under the Raw Materials Programme agreedin 1982; and on a second programme on forecasting and assessment in scienceand technology for 1983-87 (FAST II). Ministers also had an initialexchange of views in June on the Commission&apos;s proposals for a European* Converted at the 1 June market rate of 1-77 ecu =  1.20
Strategic Programme of R and D in Information Technology (ESPRIT) for1984-88, and on a new work programme for 1984-87 for the JRC following.  the cancellation of the Super Sara project.6.9 On 18 April, the Finance Council approved the conclusion by theCommunity of agreements with Switzerland in the COST series (EuropeanCo-operation in the Field of Science and Technology). The agreementscover projects under the Community&apos;s sectoral R and D programme in thefield of medical and public health, on cellular ageing and on the registrationof congenital abnormalities.6.10 On 14 June, the Agriculture Council approved the conclusion by theCommunity of a COST agreement with Sweden on a project on wood as arenewable raw material under the Community&apos;s sectoral R and D programmein the field of raw materials.Company and Securities Law6.11 Negotiations continued on the draft directives on the prospectusesto be published when securities are offered for subscription or sale to thepublic, on the qualifications of auditors, on collective investment funds(unit trusts), and on the proposed regulation to establish the EuropeanEconomic Interest Grouping (formerly European Co-operation Grouping)and the draft European Bankruptcy Convention. The Seventh Directive onconsolidated accounts was adopted on 13 June. At the end of June theCommission had still to propose an amended text of the draft fifth directive(on the structure of public companies including worker participation) whichit had announced last autumn. The Commission were revising the text inthe light of the European Parliament&apos;s opinion.Insurance6.12 Work continued on the draft directive to facilitate the provisionof non-life insurance services throughout the Community. The FinanceCouncil discussed the draft directive in June but fundamental disagreementsremain.Industrial Property6.13 Work continued on the litigation arrangements needed toimplement the Community Patent Convention. In connection with theproposed regulation to establish a Community trade mark system and theCouncil directive to approximate trade mark law of member states, theCouncil Working Group on Intellectual Property (Trade Marks) continuedits discussions on the technical content of the proposals.Commercial Agency6.14 The third reading in the Council Working Group of the draftdirective on self-employed commercial agents was concluded and theChairman&apos;s report was presented for discussion in the Committee ofPermanent Representatives (COREPER). The United Kingdom maintainsa general reservation and several specific reservations on this proposal.21
SECTION Vn:  ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORTEnvironmental Issues7.1 The Environment Council met on 28 February and 16 June. Atthe first session the Council agreed the terms of a directive providing fora two-year halt to imports of harp and hooded seal pup skins and productson conservation grounds. The Directive will come into force on 1 October1983 unless the Council decides otherwise by qualified majority on thebasis of a report and proposal due from the Commission by 1 Septemberfollowing further studies and contacts with Canada and Norway.7.2 On 16 June the Council discussed a wide range of proposals.It agreed a Directive to assist the control of discharges of cadmium. TheCouncil discussed proposals introduced by the United Kingdom, the FederalRepublic of Germany, and the Netherlands for Community action towardsthe elimination of lead in petrol. It agreed that it was willing to seek thegreatest possible reduction of the level of lead in petrol on the understandingthat this might extend to the complete elimination of lead. The Commissionwas asked to report by next April. The Council also considered proposeddirectives on the environmental effects of certain public and private projectsand on beverage containers and a proposed regulation providing forfinancial support for action on the environment. There was preliminarydiscussion of proposed directives to strengthen controls on the transfrontiershipment of hazardous wastes and to require member states to give priorauthorisation to industrial plants likely to give rise to harmful emissionsto the atmosphere.Inland Transport7.3 The Transport Council met on 23 February and 7 June. At thefirst Council a Commission paper on &quot; Progress Towards A CommonTransport Policy For Inland Transport&quot; was discussed. There was generalendorsement of the need for a pragmatic &quot; step by step&quot; approach totransport in the Community taking into account the varying circumstancesin member states. The Council now awaits specific proposals from theCommission.7.4 On 7 June the Council discussed a number of inland transportissues. Agreement in principle was reached on a Decision encouragingthe commercial independence of the Community&apos;s railways and progresswas made on a regulation on road haulage tariffs. The Council alsodiscussed vehicle weights and dimensions, transport infrastructure support,a draft resolution on the Common Transport Policy and negotiations withAustria on transport problems.   Work will continue on all these subjects.Shipping7.5 The activities of Eastern bloc carriers in the Central America,East Africa and Far East trades continue to be monitored by the Commis-sion. Negotiations continued in the Council on a draft regulation applyingthe competition rules of the EEC Treaty of Rome to shipping. Thesewere based on proposals put forward by the Commission and Denmark.22
The Transport Council of 7 June considered a report from the Committeeof Permanent Representatives on the main issues raised by the proposals.7.6 Following adoption by the Transport Council of 10 June 1982of a statement on ratification by the member states of the United NationsConvention on a Code of Conduct for Liner Conferences, the FederalRepublic of Germany and the Kingdom of the Netherlands deposited theirnational instruments of ratification of this Convention on 6 April. TheCode will therefore enter into effect on 6 October 1983.7.7 The Transport Council on 7 June agreed the substance of adecision under which member states agree to consult each other and theCommission if they adopt, or intend to adopt, counter-measures in thefield of international merchant shipping in relation to third countries. Themember states would also endeavour to concert any counter-measures theymay take. Adoption of the decision was delayed because, due to thegeneral election, Parliament had not yet had an opportunity to considerthe proposal.7.8 A Council Decision was taken on 28 March 1983 concerning aconcerted action project in the field of shore-based maritime navigationaid systems (Cost Project 301). It provides for Community funding ofup to 2-1 million ecus ( 1-2 million)* to be made available over a periodof three years. Non-member states will provide further funds undera concertation agreement. The funds are to be used to meet the co-ordination costs of the project, comprising administrative support and thecollation of results.Civil Aviation7.9 The Transport Council on 7 June agreed a Directive on theliberalisation of intra-Community regional air services. This Directivewill make it easier for airlines to obtain approval to operate routesbetween regional airports in the Community. Discussion continued in theCouncil on a draft directive to liberalise the control of air fares. TheCommission continued its consultation with member states&apos; experts on adirective on the transparency of financial relations between Governmentsand undertakings in the air transport sector. The Commission beganconsultation with member states&apos; experts on a directive on the mutualrecognition of air transport personnel licences. The Commission alsoinitiated action under Article 89 of the Treaty of Rome requiring states&apos;Governments to provide it with copies of inter-airline commercial and poolagreements.7.10 A revised Directive on aircraft noise was formally adopted on21 April. This Directive supersedes the 1979 Directive and brings intoeffect the changes for subsonic jets and propeller-driven aeroplanes recom-mended by the sixth meeting of the International Civil Aviation Organisa-tion&apos;s Committee on Aircraft Noise. In addition, the Directive introducesa ban from 1 January 1988 on foreign-registered non noise-certificatedsubsonic jets.* Converted at the 1 June market rate of 1 -77 ecu= 1.23_____
SECTION VIII:   SOCIAL AFFAIRSEmployment8.1 Employment Ministers met informally on 21-22 February when theydiscussed action against youth unemployment and the possibilities of creatingjobs by reducing working time: they reaffirmed the need to help the mostbadly affected among the young unemployed.8.2 The Secretary of State for Employment took the opportunity at themeeting of presenting a discussion paper outlining United Kingdom thoughtson how EC Employment Ministers could most usefully direct their efforts,notably in the fight against unemployment. The paper stressed that priorityshould be given to the needs of young people entering the labour market andof the long term unemployed, especially through the Social Fund, and to thedevelopment of flexible patterns of working time consistent with the needs ofindustry and with national practice. At the same time the paper reflectedUnited Kingdom concern at attempts by the Community to introduce bindinglegislation in areas which are best dealt with by individual member statesaccording to their own practice and traditions.8.3 The Standing Committee on Employment met on 20 May to considera Commission Communication on the promotion of employment for youngpeople and the measures needed to combat youth unemployment. TheCommittee considered the question of working hours on the basis of aCommission memorandum on the reduction and reorganisation of workingtime.8.4 On 2 June the Labour and Social Affairs Council agreed the basictexts for a revised European Social Fund to apply from 1984 onwards. Themain feature of the new Fund will be the high priority accorded to schemesfor young people (with a minimum 75 per cent budgetary reserve). Theregional provisions of the new Fund stipulate that a maximum of 40 per centof the main part of the Fund may be allocated to special priority regions withthe remainder being concentrated on other areas of high unemploymentparticularly where associated with industrial or sectoral restructuring. TheCouncil also agreed, subject to a Parliamentary reserve by the UnitedKingdom, a Directive providing for the protection of workers from exposureto asbestos. A Directive restricting the marketing and use of asbestos wassimilarly agreed at the Internal Market Council on 21 June. The agreementsreached are generally in line with the Report of the Health and SafetyCommission&apos;s Advisory Committee on Asbestos. The Council also had aninitial exchange of views on the Commission&apos;s proposals for promoting theemployment of young people, and considered two proposals on social security(see paragraph 8.9).8.5 The Joint Council of Education and Social Affairs Ministers met on3 June and agreed a Resolution on vocational training which provides inparticular for a guarantee of training or work experience to minimum ageschool leavers. The Resolution is closely in line with United Kingdomtraining policy and the United Kingdom is putting the guarantee into effectthrough the new Youth Training Scheme. In considering the Resolution anda report on a separate but related programme of education pilot projects ontransition from school to work, the Joint Council was able to focus on the24
needs of young people as they progress from education to adult life and onthe necessary inter-relationships between the education and training systems.The Council also noted oral statements from the Commission about futurepolicy in youth exchanges.European Social Fund Allocations8.6 In January the Commission announced the fifth and final set ofSocial Fund allocations for 1982, bringing the total United Kingdom allocationfor the year to  258 million (about 30 per cent of the total). The first twoallocations for 1983-amounting to  53 million for schemes in the UnitedKingdom-were announced in May. The following table shows the distribu-tion among the Fund&apos;s various &quot; areas of intervention&quot; of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s allocations for 1982 and for 1983 so far-1982        1983 (firstTotal   two allocations)   million millionYoung People ...........                                     151 19Regions ...............                                              65 22Handicapped ............                                          23 5Migrants ...............                                               10 0-6Technical Progress .........                                    4 2Textiles....... .........                                                3 4Women ...............                                                0 8 0-6Pilot Schemes ............                                          0-6 0 03Total       ...............                                        258 53 tigBbRight of Establishment8.7 The Directive on measures to facilitate the effective exercise offreedom of establishment and freedom to provide services for auxiliarytransport workers adopted by the Council on 29 June 1982 wasimplemented in the United Kingdom on 1 April.Education8.8 Community Education Ministers met on 2 June. They adopted aResolution on new technologies in education which will provide for anexchange of experience and information between member states.

In addition they had a useful exchange of views onthe problems of teacher unemployment in the Community.Social Security8.9 The Labour and Social Affairs Council on 2 June agreed aCommission communication containing two proposals for amending andupdating Regulations 1408/71 and No. 574/72 on the application of socialH
mmmwmwmmmmmmmmmmw^security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and tomembers of their families moving within the Community. The first amend-ment provides for second or subsequent accidents at work or occupationaldiseases to be considered in the award of benefit and also takes account ofchanges arising from the United Kingdom&apos;s new legislation on non-contribu-tory maternity grant. The second provides for the existing agreement for thereimbursement of the cost of medical treatment and unemployment benefitbetween member states to be extended to the self-employed.The Anti-Poverty Programme8.10 The Commission is discussing outline proposals for a second Anti-Poverty Programme with research and government experts, voluntaryorganisations and other interested bodies including some from the UnitedKingdom. Any suggestions put forward at this stage do not commit theUnited Kingdom Government.SECTION IX: ENERGY9.1 The Foreign Affairs Council on 14-15 March agreed to supportenergy demonstration projects in 1983 with 104 million ecus (78 millionecus plus 26 million ecus carry over- 59 million)*.9.2 The Commission announced on 28 March that part of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s refunds-400 million ecus ( 231 million)t-would be in theform of support for capital expenditure in the public sector on 17 projectsby the gas and electricity supply industries during the financial year 1982-83.These projects are wide ranging and reflect the broad spectrum of theCommunity&apos;s energy objectives: security of supply; reduction of dependenceon imported oil; movement away from oil generated electricity; and themore rational use of energy.9.3 The Energy Council on 21 April reviewed progress on Communitycoal policy and agreed that the Commission should bring forward specificproposals covering the use of solid fuels; research and demonstrationprojects; social measures; and security of supply, linked to support foreconomic production. Recommendations encouraging the use of coal inindustry and public buildings were agreed in principle.9.4 The Council also discussed recent changes in the oil market andthe implications for energy strategy, concluding that policies designed topromote diversification and the more efficient use of energy should bereaffirmed. Council approval was given to a Recommendation concerningthe need for gas tariffs to be based on economic pricing principles.Receipts from the Community9.5 The United Kingdom received from the ECSC  2 . 1 million ingrants for coal, research and development and  11-6 million for readaptation* Converted at 1 June market rate of 1-77 ecus= l.t Converted at 1 December market rate of 1 . 73 ecus= l.26
aid for miners. The European Regional Development Fund paid grantstotalling  3-2 million for electricity and gas projects in the United Kingdom.In addition  231 million was received from the Community in relation toelectricity and gas investment programmes as part of the budget refundarrangements. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA)expects to receive sums of the order of  10-15 million in a full year inrespect of Joint European Torus (JET) and the Authority&apos;s own fusionresearch programme. Payments continued to United Kingdom researcherstowards research, development and demonstration work on alternativeenergy sources and energy saving projects and for technical projects inthe hydrocarbons sector being undertaken under contract to the Commission.SECTION X:   THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COMMUNITYThe European Parliament10.1 Mr. Pieter Dankert, President of the European Parliament, paidan official visit to the United Kingdom from 22-24 June. He was receivedby Her Majesty The Queen and had meetings with the Prime Minister,the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequerand other Government Ministers. He also had meetings with CBI andTUC leaders, representatives of the political parties and the Speaker of theHouse of Commons.Elections to the European Parliament10.2 The Foreign Affairs Council on 24-25 May agreed that the nextelections to the European Parliament would be from 14 to 17 June 1984(Council Decision of 2 June 1983). The Council also adopted a Resolutioncalling on member states &quot; to make every effort as far as possible &quot; toto ensure that all Community nationals resident in the Community wereable to vote in the 1984 elections.Genscher/ Colombo Solemn Declaration on European Union10.3 The Solemn Declaration on European Union, proposals for whichwere first presented by the German and Italian Foreign Ministers inNovember 1981, was signed by Heads of Government at the EuropeanCouncil on 19 June. The Solemn Declaration reaffirms the commitmentto closer co-operation in all areas of Community activity and bringstogether in one document Community business under the Treaties andpolitical co-operation. The Solemn Declaration is not a legal instrumentand involves no Treaty amendments or increases in the powers of theCommunity institutions.European Court of Justice10.4 Three cases were referred to the European Court of Justice fromUnited Kingdom courts and the United Kingdom submitted written observa-tions in one of these cases and five others.   There were no new actions27
brought against the United Kingdom by the Commission and the UnitedKingdom intervened in only one case brought by the Commission againstmember states.10.5 The Court gave judgments of particular significance or interest forthe United Kingdom on a number of cases. In Commission v UnitedKingdom on ultra heat treated (UHT) milk, the Court ruled that UnitedKingdom legislation requiring UHT milk to be treated and packed onregistered premises effectively precluded imports and constituted a measureequivalent to a quantitative restriction contrary to Article 30 of the Treatyof Rome. The United Kingdom measures were held to exceed what wouldbe justified on grounds of public health. Imports will now be permitted underRegulations to be made under the Importation of Milk Act 1983, whichreceived the Royal Assent on 13 May 1983.10.6 In Commission v Italy, the United Kingdom intervened in supportof the Commission&apos;s contention that the application by Italy of a higher rateof taxation to spirits which had a designation of origin or provenance wascontrary to Article 95 of the Treaty of Rome because it discriminated againstimported spirits, including gin and whisky from the United Kingdom, and infavour of Italian spirits.

ANNEX EDECLARATIONADOPTED BY THE EUROPEAN COUNCILIN STUTTGART ON 18 JUNE 1983At a time when the European Community is faced with enormous socialand economic challenges and is in the process of negotiating a thirdenlargement ten years after the first accession, the European Council hasdecided to take broad action to ensure the relaunch of the EuropeanCommunity.In the course of the coming six months a major negotiation will takeplace to tackle the most pressing problems facing the Community so as toprovide a solid basis for the further dynamic development of the Communityover the remainder of the present decade.With regard to the importance, complexity and linkage of the problems,negotiations will be started under a special emergency procedure. For thispurpose special Council sessions will take place at the level of ForeignMinisters and Finance Ministers; where necessary, other Ministers will alsoparticipate, especially Ministers of Agriculture. State Secretaries may assistthe Ministers.The result of the negotiation will be submitted to the European Councilmeeting in Athens on 6 December 1983.The negotiation will cover the subjects mentioned in the conclusions of theEuropean Council of 21-22 March 1983: the future financing of theCommunity, the development of Community policies, the issues relating toenlargement, particular problems of certain member states in the budget fieldand in other fields and the need for greater budgetary discipline.Decisions will be taken in common on all these questions at the end.The negotiation will aim at examining all the existing policies withparticular attention to the Common Agricultural Policy.The examination of policies will take place with the purpose on the onehand of modernizing and making more effective the existing policies and todetermine the priority areas for new Community action, and on the otherB    hand to ensure that policies are cost effective and that economies are madewherever possible.The negotiation will in addition aim at a more balanced and equitablesituation, also in financial terms from the point of view of the interests ofthe different member states and of the Community as a whole.The negotiation will be based on the following guidelines:The Common Agricultural PolicyThe basic principles of the Common Agricultural Policy will be observedin keeping with the objectives set forth in Article 39 of the Treaty establishing42
the EEC. The Common Agricultural Policy must be adapted to the situationfacing the Community in the foreseeable future, in order that it can fulfil. its aims in a more coherent manner.The following questions will in particular be examined:-price policy,-thresholds for guarantees, in relation to objectives for production,-co-responsibility of producers,-intervention arrangements,-arrangements on export refunds,-substitutes and Community preferences,-compensatory amounts,-aids and premium arrangements,-internal barriers to trade,-type and size of farms, and particular situations of the variouscategories of farmers,-the need for strict financial guidelines,-external agricultural policy,-special problems arising in certain regions, such as in the Mediterraneanregions, in mountain areas or other regions at a disadvantage becauseof natural or economic features.The examination will result i.a. in concrete steps compatible with marketconditions being taken to ensure effective control of agricultural expenditureby making full use of available possibilities and examining all marketorganizations.All member states must contribute to achieving the savings.Proposals will be submitted by the Commission by 1st August 1983.The European Council has taken note of the communications of theCommission on Integrated Mediterranean Programmes which aim inparticular at modernizing Mediterranean Agriculture and its better integra-tion into the general economy. It asks the Council to examine them assoon as the Commission&apos;s proposals are submitted.Other policiesDevelopment of policies and new Community actionThe European Council is determined to develop and make more effectiveCommunity action in research, innovation and the new technologies witha view to facilitating co-operation between enterprises. On the basis ofproposals by the Commission, decisions will be taken on new Communityactions making use of the Community dimension to improve the internationalcompetitiveness of enterprises.Negotiations on certain projects of an exemplary nature, e.g. the ESPRITprogramme, should be concluded as soon as possible. Likewise concreteprogress should be made toward uniform standards and norms.43
The protection of the environment, employment policy, in particularconcerning young people, and social policy will be given equally highpriority.Budgetary disciplineExpenditure must also be controlled, in co-operation with the EuropeanParliament, outside the agricultural sector. Policies are to be developedwithin the bounds of financial feasibility and supplemented through newactions which must be incorporated in a economically suitable way intoCommunity policies.By 1st August 1983 the Commission will present a report with proposalsfor increasing the effectiveness of the Community&apos;s structural funds (theRegional Fund, the Social Fund and the Guidance Sector of the EAGGF).It will concentrate on a more consistent co-ordination of policies to avoidduplication of effort and expenditure and to achieve greater budgetarydiscipline.On the basis of this report, the policies in question will be reviewedand priorities determined on the basis of urgency and importance.Own Resources and particular problems of certain member statesThe objective is:-to secure the financing of Community policies and actions and theirfurther development over a longer period of time taking into accountthe addition financial requirements which would flow from the accessionof Spain and Portugal,&apos; while exhausting all possibilities for savings;-to agree measures which, taken as a whole, will avoid the constantlyrecurrent problems between the member states over the financial conse-quences of the Community&apos;s budget and its financing. All appropriateways and means will be examined to this end, in particular the proposalsmade by the Commission and the suggestions of certain member stateswith a view to ensuring equitable financial situations for all memberstates.On the basis of the conclusions reached on development of policies,improving budgetary discipline and the examination of the Financial System,the extent and timing of the Community&apos;s requirements in terms of OwnResources will be determined.Sound financial managementThe Court of Auditors of the European Community will be asked toreview the sound financial management of Community activities and tosubmit a report by the end of 1983. This report will be followed up inthe Court&apos;s Annual Reports.EnlargementThe accession negotiations with Spain and Portugal will be pursuedwith the objective of concluding them, so that the accession Treaties canbe submitted for ratification when the result of the negotiation concerningthe future financing of the Community is submitted.44
ANNEX FUNITED KINGDOM VISIBLE TRADE WITHTHE EUROPEAN COMMUNITYImportance of trade with the European Community1. United Kingdom trade with other countries of the EuropeanCommunity now accounts for almost 45 per cent of our overseas tradecompared with a share of about 30 per cent before accession. Six of our topseven export markets are members of the Community.Trade performance with the European Community (see Table 1)2. In the first six months of 1983 UK visible trade (exports plus imports)with other member countries of the European Community amounted to 27 billion (seasonally adjusted) compared with a total of almost  50 billionin the whole of 1982. There was a deficit on the balance of trade of 1-2 billion. The ratio of exports to imports was 92 per cent which althoughlower than in recent years remains significantly higher than the ratio at thetime of accession.By commodity (see Table 2)3. On a crude basis the deficit on visible trade with other EuropeanCommunity countries amounted to  1-7 billion (not seasonally adjusted)in the first six months of 1983 compared with a deficit of  1-2 billion inthe same period of last year. The ratio of exports to imports was 88 percent, a slight fall from the figure of 91 per cent in the corresponding periodof 1982. The increasing importance of North Sea Oil in the UK&apos;s tradewith the rest of the Community is reflected in the increasing share of ourexports (30 per cent in the first six months of 1983) accounted for by fuels.The corresponding trade surplus of  3-2 billion in this commodity washowever outweighted by deficits in other areas of the trade account, par-ticularly on manufactures, where the deficit amounted to  3-9 billion.4. The figures in Tables 1 and 2 include trade with Greece for all years.45
