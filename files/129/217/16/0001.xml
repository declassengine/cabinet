ALARM is as yetdeveloped, but the concept is more advanced than HARM: it incorporatesthe latest techno** particularly in software, and would therefore be morereadily capable of being enhanced to deal with improvements in Warsaw Pact^fences in the 1990s (although there must also be some uncertainty as to how^e threat developsljffcat will be needed to meet it). We should be able to^velop- it to meet oS*&amp; requirements and should not be dependent onimprovements which the Americans might decide to introduce in HARM. H10. But there must be a auej^mark over the ability of British Aerospace ? * its sub-contractors to develop; ALARM to an acceptable standard in the* ur years which they have allowed.   Past experience of weapon developments,hoth m the United Kingdom and the i(tod States, suggest that a six-yeardevelopment    programme   would   be UVrealistic.       The    contractor sdevelopment plan is based on optimistic assumptions and allows virtually not^e for the solution of any serious problt^^ arise.   There is a risk o^e slippage in deliveries.    This has tol^hed against the financial^eentive on the firms to deliver on time and fAd to supply the RAF withoperationally fully acceptable weapon.   If neveTOte delays occurred andthe RAF had to face a conflict without an adequa^apon, it would takebetween 6 and 12 months, assuming full United States co-operation, to adapt Hthe Raf Tornado to operate HARM.On final cost the ALARM programme on the face of it has^fi^er degree Hof certainty than HARM, since 97 per cent of the work would be on a tixedP^ice basis subject only to increases due to inflation.   As is usuaT^rsucharrangements, it is the contractor who would be liable for all ui8^J|uic&lt;*t caused by delays or failures on his part to meet the agreed programmet^s   could  cost  him  up to   3  milion  for  every   month overrun.     *V*^ H^^^^ |    SECRET    | _1  ^B

The Ministry of Defence regard British Aerospace&apos;s newoffer^^eptable from a contractual point of view. It involves the companyabsorbing development and production costs at a saving to the Ministry ofDefence of  97 million in return for a higher unit price to the Department forany missiles bought beyond the original 750. The effect is that the cost isreduced by compa*pn with the previous offer if less than 1.620 missues arebought and increased if the total purchased is higher than 1.620 (though the^fer does not taS^commitment by the Ministry of Defence to buy more M12.

The new price quoted by British Aerospace implies that thef?%ny are expecting that exports (and additional purchases by the Ministry^^Hfence) will determine the financial success of the project. The Ministryof defence believe that British Aerospace could at best hope to win some 25-30 P^^iS^ of the third country market, ie some 1,250-1,500 missiles. The^reasui^^^Hge it more likely that there would be no export business for^ARM, particularly if it proves to be uncompetitive on time and price.j  gct on British Aarnsp p.P4  There is a wider problem in relation to British Aerospace.   The TreasuryPoint   out   that,   WW^U   as   tne   additional  costs  from  any   slippage, thecontribution that the company will in effect be making to the development cost f ALARM will come ar^^^^, mainly over the next 3 years, when their cashwill probably be undJ|jj|nsiderable pressure from other projects. TheCortlpany&apos;s revised offer is^Bpnl on their confidence that these development osts will be covered by additi^Bfcsales revenue.   If, as a result of slippage,0r other reasons, it becomes apparent that these receipts will not materialise,^eir   cash   flow   problems   will  be   exacerbated.     In   such circumstancese Government must expect to receive ^^somewhat lower dividend on its 48P*61* cent shareholding, and also to faQe demands from British Aerospace fordeviation in other areas (eg pressing for follow-on orders for ALARM on ther defence contracts or greater launch&apos;Sj^fr^r civil projects).   In view oftlle  the   risk,   the  Treasury  feel that Brimi|^kerospace  should be askedreally for a financial appraisal and how precJK||hey expect to be able toSecure a sufficient return to meet the cost of their^SS^reduction.15. The Department of Trade and Industry, on the other hand, consider thatxt Would be improper for the Government to require such an appraisal as ame&amp;ns of defending its interests as a shareholder of British Aej^space. Sucha course would run counter to assurances given in the 1981 Prospectus^offering British Aerospace&apos;s shares for sale) that the Government did notlntend to use its rights as a shareholder to intervene in trM^^^pany&apos;scommercial decisions.

The Department of Trade and Industry have no reason todoubt the financial prudence of British Aerospace&apos;s management: they believeit is^Sfcitish Aerospace itself to judge how far ALARM is essential to the Hcompan^ikure and to balance risk against ultimate return.Technological factors16. The develop*^ of ALARM would be one way to retain in the UnitedKingdom a capability in homing-head technology. Marconi is the only British rm with this capability. They have successfully developed a number of^ssiles and are MPIfcnt engaged in completing the homing-head for thea^borne anti-ship milfeXa Eagle.

The Ministry of Defence considers that much the most eff^Vy to Hmaintain this capability would be to develop and manufacture ALARM. No other* gramme using anti-radar technology is ready to go into development: inth* absence,  therefore,  of an  order for  ALARM the  expertise in B^*^ H
^^^^I    SECRET &quot;1 I&amp; IV^dustry would be endangered and perhaps lost.   The Treasury, on the otherftl. believe that it would be possible to preserve the capability in BritishiSfcy for relatively modest expenditure, by bringing forward national workonJJL future missile projects and by financing a supporting programme inof millise technolgy.    The Department of Trade and Industryconsid^llt a decision in favour of ALARM would be an excellent example ofa public purchaser supporting important technology and would be consistentWith  the   Government&apos;s   policy   of buying  British when  British  industry  is wmcompetitive in ter^pf price, performance and technology.20. Another possibility would be to arrange with the Americans a form ofcollaboration on th&gt;#R^ programme which would give British companies thenecessary technologicmAfits. The further options offered by TI (seeParagraph 5) which JdXfeUe work on the homing-head and a repair^emty m the United King&apos;oKVeit at significant extra cost, would not addSignificantly to the United Ki^fllm national technology base. The questionremains whether an attempt should be made with the United StatesAdministration to secure more extensive collaboration on the homing-head to^e British Industry the high techno^ work. The Ministry of Defencerelieve that the chances of success UW, and even if successful thee*tra cost would remove most, if not  ^e remaining cost advantage ofHARM over ALARM and would set the in-s?^|date at risk. Nevertheless,Coring this possibility further would be relevant if the operationalconsiderations referred to in paragraphs 9 and 10. rather than cost, wereconsidered the determining factor in favour of\^jhase of HARM rather hthan ALARM.%Pi9vment considerations21 . The ALARM programme would generate some 9.400 man yearW work over7 Years in British industry. The employment would be mainM^he Londonar*a. the South of England and Lancashire. HARM would generlTOjne 3,500man years of work over 8 years, mainly in Lancashire and the W^T^ands.l* both cases, the value of export potential in job terms is assessed as about5&apos; 00 man years, but the calculation is difficult and cannot be stated with any^at precision.

However, in theft ic Expenditure Survey CPES) years 1984-85 to 1986-87, ALABM would cos.M8 &quot;,fflion more than HARM.  To accommodate these extra costs would requireadjustments.

Our efforts have hadconsiderable success. Since 1975 defence sales to the United States haveRubied in real value and the adverse trade imbalance has improved from 3.1:1h 1976 and 4.4:1 in 1978 and to 1.5,1 in 1980 and about 2:1 in 1982 (thiscontrasts with a balance between the Un^fctates and Europe of about 8:1).Stable successes during that period halj^n the sale of Rapier ( 53&quot;flUon), combat support boats ( 20 mmio^gbdium girder bridge ( 70**ion), head-up: displays for combat aircraft ( 113 million), ship: stabilisers( 16 million) AV8B (the British Aerospace/McDon Was development ofHarrier - at least  500 million). There are good^pects of maintainingth* balance at current levels at least over the next 2 years or so. H24  On the face of it, the substantial reduction in British Aerospace&apos;s price ?f r ALARM should go a long way towards removing the criticism in the UnitedSt*tes which could have resulted from a decision not to buy HARM.

A decision to purchase HARM would not of course guarantee favourabletreatment for other prospective sales of United Kingdom defence equipment totlle United States ; the protectionist tides in Congress are strong.
