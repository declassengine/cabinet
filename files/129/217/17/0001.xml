, [confidentialX ITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&lt;^^&gt; C(83)  29 COPY NO 84September 1983&lt;?Y\V CABINET&lt;&gt;^&gt;\ ELECTORAL ABUSE IN NORTHERN IRELAND/^^Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council- IThe Home Smd Social Affairs Committee (H) discussed on 26 July aproposal by^the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that legislationshould be introduced this autumn to deal with electoral abuse in theProvince. .__2. PersonationV^Cjt&amp;frling votes by pretending to be a person on theelectoral registerY/ha^Jlong been a feature of elections in NorthernIreland, but the sca^^eft which it is currently practised by Sinn Feinis of an entirely dif^e^eirt order from that which has taken placepreviously.   About 25 j^/^nt of Sinn Fein&apos;s vote at the GeneralElection was probably p^s^ji^ted and all the other political partiesin Northern Ireland, especi^&amp; y\ the Social Democratic and LabourParty (SDLP), consider thaV^couon should now be taken.3. The Secretary of State fcVx^yrthern Ireland wishes a Bill to bepassed by January, so that new^riawgements can be in force for theEuropean Assembly elections in Juys^J^84.   He considers that Sinn Fein,who obtained 43 per cent of the na-tTip^list vote in the GeneralElection, have a good chance of .overcakx^g the SDLP in June 1984 unlessaction against personation is taken, ^^-that if Sinn Fein obtain morethan 50 per cent of the nationalist yo^w^ne. constitutional nationalistsin Northern Ireland could be destroyed ^ 3r tically.   The rest of theworld would conclude that the majority ofs^nationalists supported violenceand terrorism, and any hope of co-operation between the two communitiesmight well disappear.   The Secretary of State for Northern IrelandProposes that a short Bill should be introduced eivsing him power toprovide by Order (a) that no elector should be wvett a ballot paperuntil he has produced proof of his identity by m an ~3&gt;  one of a numberof specified documents (such as birth certificate (or (Wiving licence) ;. and (b) that a mark should be made on the voter&apos;s nan^^with asubstance invisible to the naked eye but which showeJpyX^Learly underultra-violet light, so that it could be established be^r^\e is handeda ballot paper whether he has already voted.   The Bill &quot;woul^also allowthe rules on postal voting to be tightened by removing thg^^ght to apostal vote on grounds of change of address.4. H Committee did not dispute the Secretary of State for N^rkjse^nIreland&apos;s estimate of the extent of electoral abuse by Sinn Fei^dy thePotential seriousness of its consequences if it is not checked.majority, however, had grave doubts about proceeding at this stagethe measures which he proposes.4 [confidential! ,\? - l To
f% IconfidentialI HUs l^] J      There is currently great interest in electoral matters generally://^.     the House of Commons Select Committee on Home Affairs has made anumber of recommendations, and there is strong pressure for change fromv^^the Government&apos;s supporters, particularly with regard to British^&gt;^Xitizens resident abroad and postal votes for holidaymakers.   The HomeM^J&amp;cretary intends to bring forward in due course proposals for a^--^^tresentation of the People Bill, but some of our supporters areVpQja^ient of the delay, and the introduction of a Bill dealing onlyX-iJfcfo .Northern Ireland could be embarrassing.   The Bill might well becor^t^ersial - for example, the issue of identity cards could be raised -and-^t^Xnot clear that it could be passed by the end of January as theSecrajzarv^pf State for Northern Ireland requires.    It might be better towait u^rM^l-*he measures could be included in the Home Secretary&apos;s Bill.Some me foJBj7&amp; of H Committee also had doubts about the efficacy of theproposed ^af^ores, in view of the intimidation practised in NorthernIreland amjCthe possibility of other kinds of electoral abuse. TheCommittee thought that the importance of the matter was such that itshould be decided by the Cabinet.6.     I invite theM^aM-net to consider whether it is desirable tointroduce the mea$  rp-s---which the Secretary of State for Northern Irelandproposes to control/^sleatoral abuse; and if so, whether they should beintroduced as a sepa^S^^ill in the current Session, or in theRepresentation of the&lt;Pwppe Bill which the Home Secretary will bringforward in due course.
