  I    SECRET |&apos; THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(83) 23 COPY NO 31VJk 18 July 1983CABINET 0^ TIVES FOR PUBLIC EXPENDITURE - THE LONGER TERM AND THE 1983 SURVEYMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, TreasuryINTRODUCTION^In our Manifesto for the General Election we promised firm control overpublic spending and borrowing, because &quot;less spending by Government leavesmore room to v^P^ taxes on families and businesses&quot;.    On taxation we saidthat  &quot;further ftrwements in allowances and lower rates of income taxremain a high priority, together with measures to reduce the poverty andunemployment trapyjjj^This continues autonomic strategy on which we embarked in 1979 ,aimed to promote souncT^^fcth in the private sector.    We have achieved amajor and sustainable frouction in inflation.    Reductions in the PublicSector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) have played a major part in this. Butwe have not been successful in achieving our taxation objectives. Rather thanfalling,  tax as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has risen fromsome 34 per cent in 1978-79 to 40^ter cent in 1983-84.    If we are toachieve more growth and a sustanVAreduction in unemployment, we mustreduce this burden. ^fi^WThe main obstacle to the achie%a^p!^of our tax objectives is thecontinuing high level of public expeim^T^, which - contrary to popularmythology - actually rose as a proportion of GDP during the lastParliament.    If we wish to reduce taxes Tjftiust first reduce theProgrammes of expenditure which taxation^id^^therwise have to finance.Increased borrowing is not the answer: it Ifc^^imply push up interestrates and revive the inflationary pressure imudve have fought  so hard toget down.    Lower interest rates and lower taxffion are essential for thesoundly based and sustained growth which the country will now expect tosee.LONGER-TERM OBJECTIVESHence we must relate our public expenditure plann%M^L our tax bjectives.    In particular we need to consider now wli : of taxationwe should aim to achieve by 1988-89 - the last possible B%J0%&gt;f thisParliament. t/!*,In the long term it would be a reasonable objective to braj^jjeProPortion of  tax to GDP back at least to the level we inherite^J^L978-79 - that is, back from around 40 per cent now to some 34 po^^e^t.uis should broadly enable us to reduce the basic rate of income rax^J^,    Per cent, and to bring personal allowances up to the levels of t^T 1960sln relation to earnings.    Because indirect taxes and national insurance^^^^^^ I    SECRET H &apos; B
#   . 1    SECRET    | H?ml contributions would still be larger than in the 1960s the ratio of tax to^P^k        GDP would still be high by historic standards.?^?^   6.        How far we can go towards that objective by 1988-89 dependsW  ?   essentially on two things: the rate of growth of GDP and the path of public\^^expenditure.    If the PSBR continues at  its planned 1985-86 level  (2 per cent^^^f GDP) and we achieve annual growth averaging 24 per cent  - which would be^Wgeood performance in current world conditions - we could hope to reduce thetax:GDP ratio to about 36J per cent by 1988-89.    But even that would be? ^pss^ble only if we continue to hold public expenditure to its present levellT1^^^ terms throughout the period.    If economic growth falls short of2j per cent on average then public expenditure would have to be contained atan even lower level or taxes would have to be higher.I do not think we can reasonably aim for less than that on the taxfront.    I prji^se therefore as a longer-term expenditure target up to1988-89, to hold the total of public expenditure, in cost terms, at thelevel of about  103 billion (1980-81 prices) which it reached in 1982-83,and which th^B|^2nt White Paper projects for 1985-86.    I have to say thatto achieve thi%^B^et will require determination.    The projections ofexisting plans fl^^^Lend of the decade which were carried out by officialslast summer implied figures substantially higher than this, because theyallowed for substan&apos;tjf^continuing real  growth in several programmes. Suchgrowth does not show up in the aggregate White Paper figures for 1984-85 and1985-86, because we aM^t^ll feeling the  benefits of the hard decisionstaken in 1979 and 1980T J^^it could begin to appear in 1986-87 - the finalyear of the new Survey, tot which there are already substantial additionalbids.    if we are t0 achieve the progress towards our tax objective proposedabove for the end of this Parliament, we need to get on the right path bytaking now the necessary decisions relating to 1986-87.    That is whyconsideration of the Survey, coveri|^ the medium term, cannot  be separatedfrom these longer-term consideramjjj^^&apos;       If my colleagues are will ing ^R^Lnciple to work inwards thisexpenditure target, I will aim to ciro^Rfce projection:, in September,setting out a possible path up to 198  ^^Uth for the total  of expenditureand in broad terms for the main programmes.    Since this will involvedifficult decisions about priorities it wi^ftftquire considerablediscussion.    Cabinet may want to allocate more resources to one programmey reducing others.    Once agreed in broad te^^,^Lhese projections wouldProvide a starting point for discussion with ctif/^gues in the bilaterals.would hope final agreement could be reached ni Cabinet in the lateautumn.    it will be for consideration whether they should be published; but ey would set broad policy guidelines within which longer-term DepartmentalPlanning could proceed and would also provide a framework for future PublicExpenditure Surveys.THE SURVEY PERIODIn the meantime, we need to set more specific obj ectT^^^^kr thisV e a t B-^ Bl,       s expenditure Survey.    It   is clear from the Chancellor ^L.^A.Exchequer&apos;s memorandum (C(83) 26), which sets the background^dftjjheProspect for next year is much tighter than we thought at BudgeTB^^. Its therefore essential at the very least to hold to the expenditvB^BktalsPublished in the last White Paper.j;0-     Given the uncertainties this is a modest, perhaps too modest,  Trget..Ven so it will require restraint by spending Departments.    The figures innnex A show that for 1984-85 Departments have proposed increases in2^J^^^^^^^ |    SECRET ~| | g H
#   % 1    SECRET    | H. | m programmes totalling some  6.1 billion over the existing plans. ForMV 1985-86 they total  6.8 billion; and for 1986-87  7.0 billion.    Some of#PL        these, based on statutory entitlements and firm commitments, will have tobe accommodated.    For 1984-85, approved levels of social security benefitswill require an extra  0.25 billion.    Agricultural price support needs 0.A2 billion more.    I estimate that at least  0.5 billion extra will be^^^leeded for local authority current expenditure.11. Moreover I believe it is crucial that we should keep intact for^3^8^85 the  3 billion reserve which appeared in the last White Paper.TM^iould be larger than we had for 1983-84, but is roughly the same size,afa proportion of public expenditure, as the reserves for 1981-82 and1982-83.    Although a smaller figure might be sufficient to accommodate thecosts of policy changes, we have learnt to our cost this year that it isnecessary also to allow a wider margin for changes in programmes likesocial secufl^y and agricultural intervention which are demand-determined.In additi^U need to allow next year for the effects of introducing end-year flexibility, and the uncertainty over European budget refunds and thecost of the Common Agricultural Policy.12. It will h^ni^sible to accept the full  6.1 billion of bids. Butwithin that, the most pressing demands total some  2  billion.^ Wetherefore need to^H^avings elsewhere of that order (including thesavings we hope to secure on the nationalised industries) simply to staywithin the published^HOW f or 1984-85.    Reductions of at   Least the sameorder will be needed tti^J^r to stay within the published total for^1985- 86, and to keep th^total at approximately the same real level in1986- 87, including adequate planning reserves for these years.13. The existing baseline figures make no explicit assumption about payincreases next year.    I shall be *ting proposals to deal with this inSeptember.CONCLUSION14-    1 invite my colleagues to agree ^gil^ore, that:a. We should work towards the lofi3A rm objective:; for taxation,and expenditure described in paragrafMB^ above.b. I should in September bring forwartl^^ections for the totaland for programmes up to 1988-89, which fbuld be consistent withachieving these objectives.C     We should aim in the 1983 Survey to hold to the published totalsfor 1984-85 and 1985-86,  including adequate reservm which meansfinding savings of some  2* billion in 1984-85 aAjJfat least thesame order in 1985-86 to offset unavoidable increases.d. We should similarly seek savings of at least th%^^size in1986-87 in order to hold total  spending constant in r^L wh^s.e. I should discuss bilaterally with colleagues after FhjjA^esshow these savings might best be achieved.

IBAPThe Department&apos;s programme covers market regulation under the Common AgriCLuturPolicy, almost all mandatory under EC Regulations.   A large part is 100% funded fromEC Budget, with receipts credited to the EC programme.Programme expenditure is unpredictable, and dependent on agricultural market conditio ^Following recent large increases in production, particularly for milk products, sllPPexpenditure is now expected to be substantially higher than the baseline.    For iv ^current estimates point to expenditure of some  1230m compared to baseline provisiosome  800m.   About two thirds of the increase represents extra intervention purcha ^financed initially by the Exchequer. EC receipts in respect of financing and other incideade whe&quot;costs are received while the goods are in store and reimbursement for losses is mad. frystocks are sold.   The remainder of the increase is in respect of expenditure pre-funthe EC. Smaller additional bids are also likely for the later years.The revised forecasts are prepared in conjunction with estimates of total expenditure u,b1ect tothe EC budget, and the UK net contribution towards it.    The estimates are sudjsubstantial variation as that broader exercise proceeds.6.
