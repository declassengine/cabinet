SECRET    |  &gt;cr^c~X ^Uu^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(83&gt; 31 COPY NO j^^gL9 September 1983wZjL CABINETPUBLIC SERVICE PAY AND PUBLIC EXPENDITURE IN 1984-85Note by the Chief Secretary, TreasuryWe need tcu^^.de how to deal with public service Pay before finalising thepublic expenditure plans for 1984-85.    I promised to come forward withfurther proposals in my July paper C(83) 23.2. As last yeffT^6 have to make an explicit assumption about increasesin pay rates to^fcoj^de a firm basis for our public expenditure discussions,and subsequently |KAe preparation of Estimates.    Whether we wish it r not, our decision will be treated as a signal of our intentions for thenext pay round in the public sector and of our hopes for pay increasesmore generally. ?^JLTHE NUMBER3. For 1983-84 we used a figure of 3j per cent.   For 1982-83 it was4 per cent and for 1981-82, 6 per^^nt.   I propose that for 1984-85 we usea figure of 3 per cent. IllA lower figure would point more strongly to a&apos;reduction in the level f settlements.    But with inflation^^Blfc|g at 4.2 per cent and generallyexpected to rise modestly over the ne^LrBw months, it would risk beingneither credible nor sustainable.    If not tenable, its value as aconstraining influence on the expend itu^^M^s would be much weakened.5. Anything more than 3 per cent, on the^p^emhand, would be taken asimplying that we were expecting a level of setjpl^nts much the same asthis year, which is not the message we want to^get across.   The unionssre bound to treat whatever figure we choose as a floor.    They and otherswill be well aware that in each of the last three years public servicesettlements have been between \\ and 2 per cent higher than the payassumption used.  ^6. The choice of a pay assumption for 1984-85 is nowKjiAKtly affected bythe proposals on public service pensions in C(83) 30 whi^P^^are alsodiscussing of 15 September (though quick progress on thoseVj^^^sals couldaf fect the climate for pay bargaining next year). ^W^WAPPLICATIONThe assumption determines the provision made in the aggrega^^pa^Lbill for 1984-85 and later years for increases in pay rates andaHowances deriving from settlements between now and 31 March 1985. This1^^^^^ I    SECRET   1_j^^M
I    secret |. kwk ls not, of course, the same as the increase in the pay bill in 1984-85compared with this year, which will also be affected by changes innumbers, grade structure and other similar factors.    The assumption will^^i^      be applied to the provision for pay in our expenditure plans, and in theEstimates, for all public service groups including the armed forces andhealth service, and to the universities and other expenditure treated in^^whis way last year, but not to the local authorities.    There is no^JlPcerational need to make any assumption for the local authorities, sincedecisions have already been announced about the provision for their^^^%ent expenditure in 1984-85.    We can say if necessary that ourassumption is consistent with this.   Nor, as last year, does theassumption apply to the nationalised industries (though we will need tostress here also the need for settlements lower than in the current yearand set External Financing Limits accordingly).EFFECT ON PMIC EXPENDITURE8. I shall take account of the effects of this new assumption about payin the propowH^ibout public expenditure which I shall be putting toCabinet shortly,   Our published plans implicitly contain provision forinflation, bothwajPand prices, of 5 per cent made during the move tocash in the 1981 survey.   We will therefore immediately reduce the PublicExpenditure Survey baseline for programmes containing public service pay(other than local authorities) by the difference between 5 per cent and3 per cent for all f ofc^rVyears.    The figures for local authority currentexpenditure will not be affected.    The reduction in the baseline willproduce savings of abou^L400 million a year.ANNOUNCEMENT9. Our decision will need to be^Llely disseminated for operationalreasons, and we will have to accept that it will become public knowledge.1 propose therefore that we should announce it immediately.10. When we do, we should present CT^^^efore not as a decisiondetermining any individual settlement^^^^gs the provision we are makingin our cash plans.    It will not rule out settlements higher, or lower,than 3 per cent.    But, as in previous yeaJJ^ does imply a presumption-that the additional costs of any higher seMB^pnt will be found fromwithin existing provisions.   We cannot at ^^ge say that recourseto the Contingency Reserve is excluded.    But a^^^inly there is noPresumption that it will be allowed.CONCLUSIONproposei. For the cash loans and Supply Estimates we should use asingle general assumption for increases in pay rates affecting1984-85 of 3 per cent for all public service and oth^^iMectedgroups apart from the local authorities. ^^^W.ii. This decision should be announced immediately. ^^Q^^^^^^ I secret&quot;!
