^ IconfidentialI      fecw^ v/o^ H% ITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTonNV&gt;  C(83) 32 COPY NO\^/j9 September 1983vTv/\ CABINET^ XA&gt; THE ASSOCIATION OF LONDON AUTHORITIESThis papei\seeks the views of colleagues on our response to the settingup of the Association of London Authorities (ALA).    I minuted thePrime Minister on this subject on 5 August;    and have received adviceon the legal aspects, in the Attorney General&apos;s minute of 9 September andthe Lord Chancellor    -letter of 13 September.BACKGROUND ^|2. Eleven Labour-cOTtwAed London boroughs have, with the GLC,established the ALA. have requested Departments formally torecognise them and to incl\rd^&gt;them in consultations in the same way asthe existing London Boroug3*s/#vsociation, from which seven of the membershave resigned.   Although nominally open to all London authorities,membership is effectively reVprw^oed to Labour authorities by the objectsof the Association (extract atsAAiWx A) .   The nature of the ALA is alsoshown by a recent internal pape^^M^ Publicity:   Winter Campaign 1983/84&quot;.There the ALA is described as &quot;a Mmp^igning organisation&quot;.    It aims &quot;tocombat not just the Government&apos;s Iesj^jl^tive plans and financialrestrictions but also rampant anti-mupi^lpal ideology&quot;.    It proposes toraise  100,000 for a &quot;Defend London&quot;&quot;^amSaXgri, by levying contributionsfrom its member authorities.   This is svrapLv&gt; to force ratepayers to payfor a vast anti-Government propaganda campaign.    Certainly, that is howour supporters will&apos; see it. ^3. The Law Officers have advised that, despite what might be regardedas &apos;political&apos; objects, there are no real ground^^or arguing that,where consultation with associations of local authorities is requiredby statute, the ALA can generally be ignored.    F^^Sr \to consult themcould, therefore, invalidate important decisions vl*eje/aonsultation withlocal authority associations is, by law a pre-conditl^^/to the exercise ofa statutory function - eg, determining the level of a /fl&amp;6*\Support Grant.If we recognise the ALA because of the statutory provrs^#K^vwe would also have to include them, for practical purposesv^nall standing consultative arrangements, because such arraw^Rientsmay involve both statutory and non-statutory discussions, s^d^xXineline cannot be drawn between them.   As far as I am concerned-/ ae^mainXIconfidential! %^__ B
f\ Iconfidential] H% Il^yy\      consultative meetings of this kind are those of the non-statutory&lt;/^T\&gt;    Consultative Council on Local Government Finance and its officialS/&gt;   sub-groups, which are used, in particular for carrying out any&lt;^/Astatutory consultations with local government on the annual rate\C_/)support grant settlement.    Other colleagues may have equally important^/^&quot;vanding consultation arrangements.^JjJ&amp;sENT POSITION4.legal advice apparently leaves us with no option but to recognisethe&lt;-ALA&lt;^ We must do this without delay, as important timetables, suchas th&lt;&lt;P^a &amp; support grant settlement, will otherwise be placed injeoparayyVThis step will be difficult to present to our supporters -and willv4^riercely attacked for example, at the Party Conference.5. The first need is to ensure that the ALA is counter-balanced by aneffective Conservative voice.    I propose to open discussions withLondon Conservati^2Nleaders about this.   We must, however, try to ensurethat we do not treaty &apos;unnecessary obstacles to the re-formation of abi-partisan LondoSy^ii^iciation if, in time, changed circumstances makethis possible. Js\6. We also need to^nptefa. that recognition is accompanied by a firmstatement deploring the^ef^jng up of a political association, explainingthat recognition is based i3p/2in examination of statutory obligations,and proposing urgent disc\&lt;$^OT&gt;s with local government on the implicationsof this step.    I attach a okqU/of such a statement at Annex B.    It isto be hoped that we can hold^~p^^oosition elsewhere, though there arevisible signs of strain in otrv^r^A^sociations.    We can consider furtheraction after talks with these A^swaAtions.7. I have included in the draft s^te ient a reference to the possibilityof legislation.    I outlined a possibl^^pproach in my minute of 5 Augustto the Prime Minister.    I recognise q r ^ egislation enabling Ministersto specify with whom they will consult^ou&gt;^&gt; be controversial and I havenoted the objections raised by colleague^svCincluding the Lord Privy Seal)in their responses to my minute of 5 August.   Nevertheless, given theLaw Officers&apos; advice coupled with the political furore which recognitionwill stir up, we must not reject legislation as a possible option.CONCLUSION (C U-^8.
