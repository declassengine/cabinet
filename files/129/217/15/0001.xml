Inaddition MW/TSRB strongly recommended that the abatement of their 1982recommendations, dating back originally to an abatement made in 1980 andcurrently amounting to slightly less than 5 per cent, should also be madegood with effect from 1 April 1983.EARLIER DISCUSSIC^y))tHE CABINET4- When the Cabine(^c^Asidered TSRB Report No 19 on 10 May 1983(CC(83)  17th Conclusion^Mnute 2), the following points were made: .i. there were soum^Ji^vagement reasons for implementing therecommendations in TSRJyRSport No 19 in full and as soon aspossible; \V_^vii. since the TSRB abatB^rfhN.in 1982 had been justified byreference to the DDRB abarOTjeV)^ there was a strong case inprinciple for consistent tre^mgpt of the recommendations ofthe two Reports; (J^ $\iii. there would be considerable/advantage in getting rid ofthe TSRB abatement before the 198^Jffi^rt which could thenstart from a clean slate; ^} //yiv. the Government would be criticised for announcing anincrease for top salaries groups at the beginning of aGeneral Election campaign;    since decisions were to be deferredon TSRB Report No 20 relating to MPs and MinipS^rs, the proposalsin both TSRB Reports should be considered aj(terCthe Election;any increase in respect of 1983 for top salaryy^rlJyps would bebackdated to 1 April. \^x/&gt;0pTlONS FOR CONSIDERATION ^^^&gt; &apos;The Prime Minister has instructed me to set out for consecration bye Cabinet two alternative options.   Both options are desMH^dyjo ensurehat in April 1984 the TSRB is able to make reconimendations Xfe*^ tteP salary groups without having to deal with any backlog, and/wi^K&gt;herefore be on the same footing as the AFPRB and the DDRB. ThVv&amp;^onsare as follows:._, %\1 I confidential! \&gt;
0 IconfidentialI HOption A^/(\\ This is based on the principle of consistency with the treatmentof this year&apos;s DDRB Report,    The current year increase of6*9 per cent would be paid from 1 April 1983.    The abatement ofjust under 5 per cent would be restored with effect from1 January 1984.    The cost within the financial year 1983-84 would^\\\\be  4.1 million (8.2 per cent) as compared with a cost of\&gt;y^ff-^&gt; million (11.9 per cent) if the TSRB recommendations were to be/ft$uXemented in full.Thi&amp;Xwllows the principle of containing the percentage increasein c^^yithin the current financial year at approximately thesame Wyel as the percentage increase in the cost of MPs&apos; paywithin^che current financial year.   The increase of 6.9 per centfor top salary groups would be paid from 1 August 1983 ratherthan 1 April 19-83.    The abatement of just under 5 per cent wouldbe restored M?nY\effect from 1 January 1984.   The cost within thefinancial yes^1&gt;8-3-84 would be  2.9 million (5.85 per cent) ;the equivalent/Figure for MPs (allowing for a 5.5 per cent increasefrom 22 June 19s^aprd) a further 5.2 per cent increase from1 January 1984) i^JU^ per cent.   The 1983-84 cost of this optionis less than half 1^^63-84 cost of implementing the TSRBrecommendations in fod^X^ -     The table attached giva^/ae^ails of the precise salary increases forthe various grades and offices^^^ither of these two options were to e implemented. (T^VThe Cabinet is invited to cons/va^xthe recommendations of TSRBReport No 19 in the light of their^ar^pAr discussion and the options set Ut above. &lt;^y/y&gt;\ROBERT tolSIBONG%cabmet Office20 July 1983._? \\.
