I CONFIDENTIAL |        ^cw^X H&amp; I(Qj THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT^^^C(83) 35 COPY NO 82^^^KDecember 1983CABINETRESTRICTIONS ON CONVEYANCING FOR REWARD^Me^0Tandum by the Lord President of the CouncilThe Home ai^d/Social Affairs Committee discussed on 15 November and againon 6 Decembe^ what the Government&apos;s policy should be towards restrictionson conveyancing for reward.2. The reports o^-ixth the Royal Commission on Legal Services and theRoyal Commission smlMg^l Services in Scotland considered the issues andmade recoinmendationS|y^,Bciwever, the majority recommendations of the twoRoyal Commissions vex^^xycte different.   The English Royal Commission(Benson) recommended th^v/phe statutory restriction of conveyancing tothe legal professions shrorf^be strengthened; the Scottish RoyalCommission recommended ttta^^ijkestic conveyancing should not be confinedto the legal profession and/ffiaJS. subject to appropriate safeguards,members of other professions&lt;^no_Uld be entitled to undertake it. Adecision has been made more uVg^aWby Mr Austin Mitchell MP&apos;s House BuyersBill, which is down for Second&lt;\Jfea&gt;l g on 16 December.   That Bill proposesthat the conveyancing of registeS^ewTKjuses should be undertaken by anyonelicenced by the Director General ofTrading. &apos;3. All members of the Committee areag^eed that there should be a.              greater degree of competition in the p&apos;wtffSXon of conveyancing services.This would be consistent with our generalyppjicies on the benefits of ,1competition and supports our policies on^fwcouraging home ownership andremoving obstacles in the way of labour mobility,;   There is, however,some difference of view on how that competition should be encouraged:a. The Lord Chancellor favours an increasevmScompetitionsolely among the existing private practitio\^exs&gt;by encouragingthe Law Societies to revise substantially the w&apos;&apos;i_)\ernal rulesabout advertising.   He has already had successxjw^eftese lines(for example the real cost of conveyancing has  &lt;&amp;lbp &gt;significantly since the abolition of scale fees) aJ^Ho^h thissuccess has not been mirrored in Scotland.b. A further extension of competition within the legsf))profession could be achieved by allowing solicitors who^ff^e^.themselves employed (for example by banks or building \\vOsocieties) to conveyance for third parties. &lt;y///C&gt;_=?? ^1CONFIDENTIAL , r,,^^^^ i-1 J ( _
| CONFIDENTIAL | Hc.     Finally there is the possibility of allowing non-legally^^yCTj qualified persons to offer conveyancing, subject to suitable(jg^ controls.    This is the option pursued in Mr Austin Mitchell&apos;s Hi&lt;syj&amp;3 of the three choices would improve competition.   The difficulty liesknowing by how much and with what consequences.^CvJJlie Lord Chancellor&apos;s preferred course of action would clearly betnV^roat limited.   He, for his part, sees very real danger to theprovas&amp;TOv of legal services generally in the proposal (b. above) to alloweimplJSye^TWDlicitors to do conveyancing.   He thinks that this will resultin a Mrg^swing of business away from solicitors in private practiceand tha^tfiS^ will seriously damage the viability of small practices,particulalnuo^ose in rural areas.   The results will be that some practiceswill close djcfwn,   leaving the surrounding area with insufficient sourcesof legal adv ce, while others will seek to increase the amount of theirwork which is funded by the Green Form and legal aid schemes.   This couldin turn lead to increased public expenditure or difficult decision aboutlimiting the scope^Typperation of these schemes.   Furthermore theLord Chancellor cciJsLsij&amp;M^ that even this step would seriously damagerelations between th^Gcwernment and the legal professions.   He is alsoconcerned about the sfcrjKt^cts of interest that could arise for anemployed solicitor bettfew(^&gt;is responsibility to his employer and hisresponsibility to his cl^e^v^5. The Lord Chancellor fee^/ hat these considerations apply even morestrongly if the right to conwyance is extended to non-solicitors(c. above).   Furthermore he obe^BWt believe that it would be possibleto implement an adequate system^bjjsnsumer protection in relation tonon-solicitors.   The consequence^^nejefore, of allowing something likethe scheme in Mr Austin Mitchell&apos; s/KwT\would be to put at risk thetransaction (buying a house) which, ptiy^bost people, is one of the mostimportant they undertake in their lives-^/6. Many members of the Committee, on ^th&amp;^p-Jher hand, believed that ourgeneral approach to competition should lea^us to question very carefullywhere the balance of advantage lies and whether many of the difficulties.could not be overcome.   Some considered that there was little reason todoubt that effective arrangements could be made ifdesired regardinginsurance and registration of non-solicitor prac^rTiisners, and that thesecould be operated with very little additional co^^co-the Government.They would concede that mistakes could be made, but/Twould argue thatthere is no reason to suppose that these would be ffigw^cantly morefrequent or more disastrous than under the existing r^gyuji^7. Other members of the Committee considered, however^roa^&gt;the risksinvolved in extending the right to offer conveyancing serv^ &lt; Nto non-solicitors were too great but that this was not so if the ri^htfjwasextended only to employed solicitors.   This in itself would tto^raguirelegislation if the Law Society agreed to amend its rules (altn irgh/itmight require legislation to enable building societies to offer^fl&amp;Wservices).   It was thought the Director General of Fair Trading w ji*dys., 1 , %CONFIDENTIAL&apos; 1&apos;;V. J
I CONFIDENTIAL | HU__)) be able to control any attempts by banks or building societies to use^^f)      unfair practices (for example to require their customers to use theirconveyancing services as a condition of receiving a mortgage) whilev/v\ special arrangements could be made to deal with the possibility of&quot;^vJ&gt;conflicts of interest between the solicitor&apos;s responsibility to his&lt; X^\tm&gt;loyer and to his client.   If this course of action was adopted, there\&lt;^J*mild be no need to restrict it to registered land and indeed no logic^-^R^roing so.^&lt;?ywp\teeling as Chairman was that a substantial majority of theComm^tre^L took the view that the best course would be to announce,probabl^Xn the Second Reading debate on Mr Austin Mitchell&apos;s Bill,that rfie^Jovernment was committed to an extension of the right to offerconveya^63S*)to employed solicitors.   The method of doing this - butnot the pr^aciple - would be for discussion with the Law Societies inEngland amr^cotland.   The extension could apply to all land and notsimply to registered houses as in Mr Austin Mitchell&apos;s Bill. Thiswould improve still further the competition within the legal professionwhich has already bjen created by the Lord Chancellor&apos;s efforts.    Eut Idid not feel that/^ttey\e was a clear majority in the Committee to extendthe right to do csmi?e&gt;aneing to non-solicitors.9.     I invite the CaKjrfe^to consider whether:a. to limit the iy  wto conveyance to the existingpractitioners while &quot;^nSboyajaging the Law Societies to revisesubstantially their ii\ M^i rules about advertising; orb. in addition to exteni^cmkright to conveyance toemployed solicitors and tOvMiKU^Ktake consultations on howbest to avoid conflicts oiz^ttjkp&amp;t and unfair competition; orc. in addition to extend the ra^ftoto conveyance at leastregistered houses to non-solicitor^xwith suitable safeguardsas regards competence, probity ai y3?2emnity.%Privy Council Office &lt;VV\V9 December 1983CONFIDENTIALI    ^_ 1. ti o \
