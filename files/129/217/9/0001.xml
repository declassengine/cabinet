1    secret    | HTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT Sfl|C(83) 21 COPY NO 30^&quot;^L5 July 1983^^Q^ CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE IN 1983-84Memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerI have to JT^^ft that overall public expenditure this year is running sub-stantially ahead of the figures agreed by Cabinet and published in theFebruary White Paper (Cmnd 8789) .This is rej^^^ed in very high rates of public borrowing.    The monthlyfigures for cen^^lTkyernment borrowing have caused concern in the markets,and the quarterly figures to be published this month are likely to increasext-    The first quar  Ki|entral Government borrowing requirement figure, due n 11 July, is likel^^l^me some  5 ,400 million, which is  2,000 million morethan the comparable f^ur^last year, and very nearly half the figureenvisaged at Budget time for the year as a whole.    If it were thought thatwe were willing to see expenditure and borrowing on this scale continueunchecked, interest rates would rise, damaging the private sector and theprospects for jobs and recovery.3-     We must not allow this to twfn,    We need to do what we can to step upthe disposals programme; and this is already in hand.    But that alone willnot be sufficient.    We also need to tackle the spending surge at source, andbring this year&apos;s expenditure totaT%^M^ to the Cmnd 8789 path.^.     The surge in expenditure which be%ki^jkte in 1982-83 has continuedunabated.    Demand-related programmes - particularly agricultural support andsocial security benefits - are growing very rapidly.   Local authority currentexpenditure and nationalised industry borrowing are also likely to be higherthan envisaged.    In the light of the 1982-83%ouAirn, we now expect only halftne  1,200 million shortfall in cash-limited (^^Sfeiture assumed in the WhitePaper.    Of the  600 million extra expenditure now expected, about  300 million Ixs on defence votes, and the rest spread across the field.^*     I emphasise that I am not asking for cuts in the published expenditure.total this year: but I am sure that we must get back cl tf|t to the WhitePaper total.    To defer action could well mean having to do much more beforethe autumn, given the likely market reaction to the borrowingfigures. Andxn any case it makes sense to consider the problem immedi^Sfc^^n order togive the maximum amount of time in which to make the necess^^ry^mljustments.6- The first and most obvious step is to try to curb the ino^^Mp on non-cash-limited demand-determined expenditure.    I should be grateful if thosecolleagues concerned would explore all appropriate available options.7- Realistically, however, we cannot expect to achieve a great dead^y^thatroute.    To get back on course we shall have to take action on cash limits.1I   ^^^^^^^^m SECRET ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^B
secret ~~1 Ht*a  *      ^ believe that there is in fact some room for such action, particularly^?^t on the non-pay side, because prices this year are in general rising moreslowly than was expected when Departments drew up their plans .   Nor can we^^^^    exempt the pay side,  though we need to take account of the pressure resultingfrom our decision earlier in the year to finance the non-industrial Civil^^Ta Service pay increase from the original provision.I therefore propose a reduction of 1 per cent on the &quot;pay&quot; element andof 2 per cent on the non-pay element of all central Government cash limits.^pe^Jpay&quot; element would include general administrative expenditure. IPJJ^-^e excluding Rate Support Grant, because it is very doubtful whetherc\Ws would actually lead local authorities to reduce their current expen-diture, and local authority capital expenditure.10.    it would not be right to exempt the nationalised industry ExternalFinancing Lypits (EFLs).    For those industries currently forecasting an over-run in their EFLs, remedial action must be taken to ensure that theirrequirements are kept to the minimum.    In addition I propose for the industries Ioverall a 2 iWUfcnt cut in the provision for total EFLs, to be allocated inproportion to^u^l^er.*!.    If Cabinet agrees, the Treasury will agree with Departments a detailedlist of the cash nmB^f f ected.    The savings would be in the range 650-700 million grTO^Wfcr around  500 million net of some further reductionin shortfall. V&gt;\12. At the same time, mm to discourage a repetition of last year&apos;s end-yearSurge, I also propose to introduce a scheme of end-year flexibility. Thiswould permit the carry-over of underspends on capital items of up to 5 percent of the original provision, as described in paragraph 19 of the noteattached to C(82) 29.    (Individuaj^tocal authorities already have a measure f end-year flexibility, and I tsU therefore propose to include them.)There would be considerable managerial advantage in such a scheme, andspending Departments have been prea^^j^f or it.    It would mean that spend in;&apos;lri this financial year would be reduced, by perhaps a further  100 million&apos;(though pressure next year would of coKse^te increased).13. The present problem arises in part DaH^ it has proved so difficult toProvide reliable forecasts of rates of spending.    This is a problem through-out the year, but is especially acute towar^^t^k year-end, as Departmentsseek to spend up to their cash limits.    There J^^^also been severe problemsover forecasting demand-related expenditure.       therefore seek the co-operation of spending Ministers in improving the financial information flowsfrom their Departments to the Treasury during and particularly at the end oftne financial year.   Detailed proposals will be made at official level shortly I14-    I realise that the proposals in paragraphs 9-11 aAeMe^will cause somedifficulty.    But the situation we face is very serious^i^J^^ie actionProposed is the minimum required to hold to our Budget strategy to con-solidate the recovery and so improve job prospects.    And wl^pl^ act now.1^&apos;    To sum up, in order to get closer to the agreed public expenditure total, &apos;^ 1 Propose:-a.
