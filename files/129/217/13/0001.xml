Chief Secretary, Treasury 8M|%&gt; - ?We are comh&amp;tted to reducing the size of the public sector.    Although , mmmuch is being done to &apos;privatise&apos; public sector functions completely bytransferring them to the private sector, many tasks must remain in thepublic sector.    Bu ~ his does not necessarily mean that they must all bedone by public saYva^Vs.    Experience has shown that it is often moreefficient to  &apos;cor&amp;L^aut&apos;  such tasks to private enterprise and that thepossibility of conttkcU^io out stimulates in-house staff to perform morecompetitively.    MuchNw^^done in the last Parliament.    We must maintainthe impetus.    Cabinet wfejOecember 1982 (CC(S2)  53rd Conclusions,Minute 7) agreed on a dt^e^o secure further contracting out in thepublic sector.    As agreec^tf^ex&gt; I am reporting progress in this paper. \   &apos; V:2-     Many services have tradit&lt;(^r*v been contracted out, eg buildingand enginerrina works and manage^e^t/ consul tancy.    The drive forefficiency during the last Pari iam/tfK^d to much more contracting outin central Government services (eg^^i^e cleaning) and in some local WmWauthority services (eg   direct labouY organisations (DLOs) , refusecollection and street cleaning).    Sin^i^ast reported Government  _ WMMdepartments have begun to consider moreXftoi^ous schemes, impetus in thelocal authority sector has increased andVfrti^ Secretary of State for jHSSocial Services has launched a major initiative in the National Health WBRService (NHS) .CENTRAL GOVERNMENT //^)\ W8Most departments have contracted out some se^i^e^. particularlyin domestic areas like office cleaning, laundry, cixevJJ^, security, ^ $lflttyping and reprographics and comouting.    Up to Decemb^^/982 savings have Wmbeen achieved of nearly 15,000 staff and at least  9 net Per annum-Further contracting out has been considered in the conts0^% control ofcivil service numbers after 1984  [C(83)  24].    Those furChei^oposalsmight save about 5,000 posts;    it is too early to estimate&amp;gfcs&amp;Cial _savings.    Some go beyond domestic services;    examples inclu\^^Uectionof statistical data in a number of departments, maintenance o^^V^ceradios in the Home Office research and teaching at the Royal ^fc-JbyCollege of Science at Shrivenham and warehousing tasks in the tfi&amp;fitw OtDefence.

fr\ ICQNFlDENTlALl j&apos;Ol- I&lt;^/^      LOCAL AUTHORITIES4.     The 1980 Local Government, Planning and Land Act required local ^ ^MMauthority DLOs to bid for a substantial proportion of their work against     ^ M^M&lt;X^ompetitive tenders from private contractors.    In consequence DLOs undertook U^M\C)tss than 10 Per cent of a Cotal of  2l&gt;000 million construction and\^\tenance work in 1981 and staff numbers fell by 11 per cent to 134,000 U^UCfK^en   April 1981 and October 1982.    Regulations which will substantially U^mU%Mse the proportion of general highways, new buildings and maintenance M^MwoW^rh must be put out to competitive tender (or given to contractors) M^MhavVb^^vlaid before Parliament. ^LtM5- S   *a ) apart from DLOs, our efforts have focussed upon exhortation mmmto locarsi^harities to contract out their services. In consequence a ^ ^total of $6^h?ve contracted out refuse collection and street cleaning with |gMexpected n^ savings of nearly  30 million. To go beyond exhortation will, |gjg|for the most part, require legislation. I recognise the difficulties m that Hbut I believe that we must acknowledge now the need for it in due course. |||||I shall discuss wL^sthe colleagues principally concerned the best way to ; .make progress on Mm is)issue.national health ser-^c^))6- About  160 millioM^^h of work is contracted out by the NHS(1981-82 figures).    This^fS^ides building and engineering maintenanceof  110 million, maintena-nc^^ equipment and vehicles of  30 million anddomestic (cleaning, caterir&lt;^n^v laundry) services of  17 million.    The j^flscope for increased contrac1^ /pu  is illustrated by the fact that thetotal NHS expenditure on domeVcJK^ervices is nearly  400 million.    In ^ ^MMFebruary the&apos;Secretary of Stat^skySocial Services initiated consultation ^MM n a draft circular proposing ttt^^lk authorities should seek tenders for ^MMcleaning, catering&apos;and laundry seryjJ^V  Tbe circular should be with ^MMhealth authorities in July or early^Atf&amp;O&amp;t.    Further extensions of ^MMcontracting out are being considere&lt;r^L^P number of areas.NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES ^^/^ ^|7- Commercial pressures, and the requirement to keep within theExternal Financing Limits, lead management in the nationalised sector tocontract out a wide range of services where this is cheaper than producing mjjmthem in-house.    For example, the energy industries&apos;.one contract out over ||||| 2 billion of activities each year.    Our prime oWec&lt;yives with the h nationalised industries are to increase competiti^/^rrd\ to privatise.  _ [f|p|However,  it is clearly right that activities remaitiWAfrithin the publicsector should be carried out in the cheapest possible^^/in some casesthis may involve further contracting out.    The possibnAA^ek are at ^MMPresent being pursued industry by industry as part of tt^^worate ^MMPlanning and performance review procedures.    E(NI) recently^cided ^that _ ^MMxn future collective Ministerial discussions of the nation j p^ industries ^MMshould concentrate on strategic issues.    I proposed, howeve^j-gJK Treasury ^MMand departmental officials should&apos; continue in the course of an&gt;^Vf orpora te mmmPlanning discussions to press the industries to increase the a^OtoOot work ^MMcontracted out, and report the results.                                              /K?&lt;\ ^Lm. [confidential! \&gt;
?GENERAL BH.      Under normal procedures, Value Added Tax (VAT)  can only berefunded for business activities.    This has been a disincentive to(j^XXontracting out by Government departments and the NHS.    (Local authorities&lt;\^_Jyln already reclaim VAT.)    The clause to enable Government departments andV^^lth authorities to claim VAT refunds was dropped when the\\v /\^nance Bill was shortened.    There was not room to include it in theW^Tytit Finance Bill;    We intend to reintroduce the clause in 1984.1&quot; Xp^^eantline we propose to enable refunds to be claimed by extrasta^nA concession from 1 September. BH- .     Tfrji^rjL^hts of staff transferred to a new employer when an undertakingls contS^SV^u out, are protected by the European Communitites &apos; AcquiredRights Bi%A^yvve.    We have just received the Law Officers&apos; Opinion onWhether andAhow this Directive applies to the Crown.    Treasury Ministers ^Bflare consulting colleagues on this, and on the Public Services (Transfer jjBBh f Functions) Bill,  separately. j^H.
