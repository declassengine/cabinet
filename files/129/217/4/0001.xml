\ Jprime minister . .......strikes in essential industries?     We are to meet on 11 May to resume the discussion at e Committee ?.   on 28 April on the outstanding legislative issues, includingPossible constraints on strikes in essential services.    It may^ helpful if I sketch out the possibilities and the arguments ?for and against making immunity dependent upon the honouring ofProcedure agreements which 1 see as the option most worthy oi Mconsideration.As background/ I see little prospect of establishing no-strike agr. nen BIn any case they would be expensive and probably ineffective. IWould not advise using the criminal law.   The criminal sanctionsstill in force under   the Conspiracy and Protection of PropertyAct 1875 are not applied.    Going further would create more problems&quot;than it would solve, not least of enforcing sanctions againstwould-be martyrs in large or small numbers.    We should not^template making it a criminal offence for an employee to refuse. to work beyond the expiry of the notice he can currently give to  end his employment.^is leaves the possibility of extending the scope of civil action. HHe*e the proposal we have already agreed to remove immunity in theabsence of pre-strike ballots,.together with the restriction oiu*ion immunity in the 1980 and 1982 Employment Acts, will ao mucht0 reduce the propensity to strike in essential industries aselsewhere.    Beyond this, the possibilities arem.  for&gt; mTtffoni-aine industrial action in .1to remove immunity for organising,essential industries;SECRET-1 - n m
? 7to make procedure agreements enforceable at law.I do not believe the case   for removing immunity for organisingindustrial action in essential industries is strong.    The verydefinition of &quot;essential&quot; would be difficult; but more important. this step is likely to be ineffective.    Ordinary consumers, inmost cases, would have no cause of action, (eg NHS patients haveno contractual right to treatment).    The decision whether to sueunions for organising strikes would therefore normally fall  nthe employers concerned.    For the removal of immunity to beeffective, trade unions would have to believe that employers twere willing to sue, and that must be in doubt.    And it is aiJ- {5to see how immunity could be withdrawn without providing arrang(eg unilateral access to arbitration) which would always resolve&quot; 5disputes without the threat of recourse to industrial action., i|H However,  the principle that agreements once made should be hon l ^^is irrefutable.    We have always stressed the importance of br1?greater order and predictability into industrial relations anthe need to deter precipitate strike action.    Legislation to_ , oir vioU10give the observance of procedure agreements the force of ia therefore be fully in accord with our general approach.    The innses Wdid not arouse wide enthusiasm from employers in their respUIto the 1981 Green Paper, but it has had the support of the ^the Institute of Directors and it has recently gained greatssupport following the refusal of the unions in the&quot;waterto honour the agreement to accept unilateral reference by theI employers to binding arbitration.&apos; . reas n ajIf we decide to legislate on this issue there seems no good      t?ie&apos;&apos;\ $to confine ourselves to the difficult-to-define essential indu ?The principle is of universal application.    The questions we. ? nd tlie pito consider are the form legal enforceability might take anPieffects it might have in&apos;practice. ^I
!/ .   secret. IEnforceability might be achieved in two ways. The more directway would be to deem procedure agreements to be enforceable atS law by either party, just as if they were legally bindingc ntracts, irrespective of the intentions of those whont 0riginally entered into them.    Alternatively, observance of.   aSreed procedure could be made a condition of immunity forve lnc*ucing breaches of contract in furtherance of a trade dispute.It 4 .is clear that employer opinion strongly favours the latteraPproach.    If procedure agreements were deemed to be bindinglt        c nt^acts, it would provide opportunities for trade unions to^  &quot;t5        ^alCe or threaten legal action against employers whilst the employers&apos;emedy would be at best uncertain, particularly against unofficialsti&gt;ikers.    The immunities approach does not have this disadvantage.rikes in breach of procedure now have immunity, but immunity.    irrelevant to an employers decision whether or not to break atil* pr.          ?    c dure although he may of course face a lawful strike if he^ 6s so.    Removing immunity from strikers in breach of procedure could Ie^efore be seen as restoring the balance.    I have no doubt that115 immunity approach would be preferable.e effect of legislation on these lines would be that a union3 , ^ich organised a strike in clear breach of an agreed procedureUJ-Q do so without immunity and therefore at risk to its funds.sUch a case the attractions of legislation are clear. The^r&gt; blem lies in assessing how often such cases would actuallyCUrj. given the nature of most procedure agreements.    It hasto k.ue .remembered that most employers do not have anything thatcan kp  e termed procedure agreements governing negotiations on*\,ieS&apos;        nnUai or major pay claims.    In the main, their agreementsj with matters such as grading claims, grievances ande  ^isei i .-^Plinary matters.    Procedure agreements covering annuale Paynegotiations are more common in the public than in the^    a&lt;;e sector, but even there they often provide for no morean the agreed forums in which negotiations are to take place.eejnents providing for successive stages- for negotiations! &quot;^^^^^^
/ SECRET /? / seSet ? /?/ . (ms)and finally for the involvement of third parties (particular^as arbitrators) are relatively rare.    The effect of legal ,enforceability on disputes over major pay issues would tne-r.be limited, unless agreements provided for binding arbitrateas a final stage and our policy is to avoid reference toarbitration except on the agreement of both parties.Many procedure agreements, are too vague and imprecise tolend easily themselves to judicial interpretation. Theremust be a risk that the courts v/ould decide that some agJ-^included mere expression of intent and had no precisemeaning and hence that immunity was not lost despite empl0^complaints of a breach.    There is also the risk of a concertcampaign by trade unions to withdraw from existing procedureagreements and to refuse to enter into new ones, similar*to the successful TUC campaign not to enter into legallybinding collective agreements under the 1971 Act.    The CBlhas recognised this risk.    A number of possible ways ofcountering this threat or of providing alternative mechamsin the absence of procedure agreements (including bindingarbitration and compulsory arbitration by ACAS) have been9suggested but I do not believe any would be satisfactory.My conclusion is that the risk of a successful campaignto v/ithdraw from procedure agreements v/ould simply have tobe faced.    Formal withdrawal from procedure agreementswould nullify the legislation and also present greateropportunities for militants.    It v/ould undoubtedly alarmthose employers who currently operate under generallyi, &quot;  effective procedure agreements.    But in practice, tradeunions might be found to value existing procedure aSreeine ^gjii&apos;sufficiently to retain them or at least tacitly to observeI am sending copies of this minute to the Heme Secretary&gt;?   the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State_ n _SECRET1 ^
