py/ |    SECRET    J ?\ ITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT^Q(83) 36 COPY NO13 December 1983CABINETELECTRICITY PRICES^Memorandum by the Secretary of State for EnergyAt Cabinet onW^^byember the Minister of State, Department of Energy,explained that^j^%lectricity supply industry was likely to raisedifficulties abomt_ i^^rice increase of 3 per cent from April 1984 includedin the report of the Ministerial Group on Public Expenditure (MISC 99) tothe Cabinet.    The S^ftfiry of State for Energy would use his bestendeavours to persuade the industry to accept the Government&apos;s view onprices.    But he had nM^a^utory power to require it to do so, and he wishedto have discretion to agj^^^o proposals from the industry which wouldproduce equivalent savings.    The Minister of State had discussed the matterwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer on this basis on 9 November. TheCabinet concluded however that it was not ready at this stage to regardadditional savings as a substitute for the price increase.2. Following the Cabinet decispressed the Chairman of the Electricity iCouncil strongly to secure the agreement of the 12 Area Boards and theCentral Electricity Generating Boar^^^jhe 3 per cent price increase. Ireinforced this by pointing out that the Government had now published anExternal Financing Limit (EFL) for 19JLff*^hich would require them to  pay  740 million to the Exchequer.    On 21 November, following two meetingsof his Council, the Chairman sent me a reasoned reply, which I forwarded .on 24 November to the Prime Minister and tSlHkchancellor of the Exchequer.There has been further correspondence betweefc^h^Chancellor of theExchequer and myself.    The Electricity Council^^^eady to accept the imposedEFL of  740 million and to do its utmost to meWthis through all theroutes open to management; but is opposed to a 3 per cent price increase from iApril 1984.3. In spite of the handicap of the National Coal Board^jJCB) , the energyindustries have produced 71 per cent (nearly  2.7 billion) of the publicexpenditure savings achieved by the nationalised industries in the recentpublic expenditure survey.    The electricity industry in p^W^ilar hascontributed over  1.8 billion over the 3 years and has acc%^#^| negativeEFL of  740 million in 1984-85.   They are ready to meet the f^U^quirements iof MISC 99 on public expenditure and to try to give the Government thebest of both worlds by avoiding or minimising any general price increase in^^^^^^ |    SECRET 1
1    SECRET    | I% IINDUSTRY&apos;S RELUCTANCE ABOUT A 3 PER CENT INCREASE\__gj_l*     Part of the background to the industry&apos;s resistance is that thei ^^2|overnment were urging them in the opposite direction as recently as thespring of this year.   The then Secretary of State for Energy urged theElectricity Council to change its approach to pricing, in the light of a. ^p_  from consultants.    They concluded that the Council could reduce theelement in its prices attributable to future investment because the industryha-no early need to increase capacity.   With this in mind my predecessoragreed with the Chief Secretary, Treasury in March 1983 a lower financialtarget for the 2 years 1983-84 and 1984-85 than the Electricity Council hadproposed; a return of 1.4 per cent on current cost assets instead of2 per cent. ^_*     Since Then the industry has been doing better than its financial targetbecause of hflra^ferowth in the economy, lower inflation than forecast andgreater effic_tu0f_lts latest forecast is that it will overshoot itsnegative EFL of ^_J|_illion for 1983-84 by  184 million.    It publishedgood profits in July and is still under heavy pressure from industry andfrom the Consumer rToJ-PUs to avoid price increases or to give rebates.Having forecast tentatively in July a need for a price increase of 6 per centm 1985-86, the Counc_k^%e_Lced this to 3 per cent in mid-November,removing the likelihoooo^^severe increase in that year.FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK AND PRICESIt is not surprising that the industry saw our request for a 3 per centprice increase as inconsistent w_:|_l_e financial framework we had alreadyestablished.    We are in some dan{(_^_over-determining the system by seeking ito control both the financial framework _md prices.7-      In fact I am clear that the rig~_~Wse is to manage these industriesby reference to financial targets, to m_?rl_yarying these targets at shortintervals and to leave price determination to them within the financialframework which the Government determinesTJ_j_ is how we describe ourpolicy, both publicly and in letters to the Chairman of the industries, andI believe it is the only way to manage them^_rid^gntly.    &quot;Economic pricing&quot;tnay be a valuable guide to the direction of price movements and a constituentin the determination of financial targets, but^t is not a neat guide toindividual price changes; and determining what is &quot;economic&quot; is open to greatargument.8.     what is clear in the case of electricity is that anjj u:ivate competitiveindustry in their situation would not be making price increases.   This is anindustry with between 25 per cent and 30 per cent excess generating capacityand with gross over-capacity also in its principal supplie^^^raw material,the NCB.    As my predecessor concluded, the right course for%fe^j^ricityPrices is certainly not upwards.    Although, as required by C^^mll^  I havePressed the electricity industry to make a 3 per cent price increase, andhave secured a gas price increase from 1 January 1984, I think Typfl?gkself-destructive for a Government pursuing a rigorous policy againstI_____ I    SECRET    | J
r1^^^   inflation not to let the economy in general and British industry inparticular have the benefit of low prices for a basic commodity like^^^Vfelectricity when there is no question of any element of subsidy in doing^C%P:    quite the contrary.9. There has been concern about how the electricity industry will achieve^^re ^740 million EFL and whether it will run down stocks (reducing powerst^tf^s endurance) or engage in end-year switches of money.    The. Chairmanor.The Council assures me he has no intention of resorting to these devices.Moreover he is ready to propose a price increase during the year ifnecessary to achieve the  740 million.   I shall monitor their progressclosely with this in mind.   Meanwhile positive cash flow is at presentrunning at aa^nnual rate of  600 million.   He is well on target to achievecost reducfciM^rformance targets over the 2 years to 31 March 1985. Heis reviewing working capital requirements as urged by the Treasury. Theindustry has a record of keeping promises and has achieved its financialtarget in each%&gt;Jfllhe last 5 years.10. Even without any tariff increase in 1984-85 there will be a smallincrease for industry under fuel adjustment clauses, balancing a smallreduction for industry in 1983-84.    I am in touch with the industry aboutinter-Area difference OT^fce effects on industry.    But none of this is anyargument for further arcejpm to enforce the 3 per cent increase; quite thecontrary.CONCLUSION11. On every ground it seems to m^fcight to leave the industry now tominimise price increases within the new and exigeant EFL.   This would beright for public expenditure, for good nationalised industry management,for inflation, for British industryH^^Eor political reasons.    I ask theCabinet to agree accordingly. ?^^^P WDepartment of EnergyDecember ^||^^^^^ ? SECRET    | l&quot;0m
