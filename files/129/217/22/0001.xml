Comparedwith the position in July, bids for additional expenditure had beensubstantially reduced.    But significant bids were still outstanding.In order to achieve the Cabinet&apos;s objective they would have to beoffset or withdrawn, and additional savings found.   The gap to bebridged was some  1.1 billion iutfl^4-85,  1.7 billion in 1985-86, and 2.5 billion in 1986-87; the figure for 1984-85 assumed a reserve of 3.0 billion, that for 1985-86 a reserve of  3.5 billion, and that for1986-87 a reserve of  5.0 billion.^^k^^e were outstanding issues ondefence, agriculture, foreign af f airs^^emication, arts and libraries,and the nationalised energy industrie^^fti agreement had not beenreached on local authority current expenditure in 1985-86 and 1986-87.3. In accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s conSfBLps on 20 October(CC(83) 30th Conclusions, Minute 4) the PrM^M^aister established theMinisterial Group on Public Expenditure (MlSC^^^under my chairmanshipto try to resolve outstanding issues.AGREED PROGRAMMES4. After MISC 99 was set up, the Chief Secretary, Tre^fciry reachedagreement bilaterally with the Ministers concerned on overseas aid andforeign affairs; arts and libraries; and local author^^tfLrentexpenditure in 1985-86 and 1986-87.    The Group reached agreement withthe Secretary of State for Energy on the nationalised eneW^W%Jus tries;and with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food orMjJie^Aagriculture and fisheries programme.   The basis on which agreement was 1reached is summarised in Annex A. JKl^.% I
|    SECRET |DEFENCE^^^^     5.      In the case of the defence programme the Group reached agreement^^^L with the Secretary of State for Defence on figures for 1984-85 and^^^1985-86;  the Secretary of State for Defence and the Chief Secretary,^^drlreasury subsequently reached agreement on the figure for 1986-87.The Cabinet will wish to give particular attention to the agreements^^In^h have been reached on this programme.The main figures (the figures, unlike those in Annex D, are afterthe allocation of pay clawback) are as follows:a. for 1984-85  17,010 million, compared with a surveybaselij^figure of  17,178 million (agreed provision of 684ApHmion in respect of the Falklands included in bothfiguU^kb. fo^Qflk86  18,040 million compared with a surveybaseline ^gu^ of  18,214 million (agreed provision of 552 milliw^^Lrespect of the Falklands included in bothfigures) ;c. for 1986-8^P^^650 million,  including  450 millionin respect of the Falklands, compared with a surveybaseline figure or^^8,192 million, in which no provisionfor the Falklands had been included.Further details are set out in Annex B.7. In arriving at the figuresAfMr^l984-85 and 1985-86, it has beennecessary to take account of the Government&apos;s commitment &quot;to plan toimplement in full the North Atlan^Bk^eaty Organisation target of 3 percent real growth in defence spend in%^B^ year until 1985-86&quot;. Thefigures for these two years are ther^^r^accompanied by a form of words,set out in Annex B, which has been agreed between the Secretary of Statefor Defence and the Chief Secretary, Tr^ajJ^   For 1986-87, to whichthe 3 per cent commitment does not apply, the figure of  18,650 millionis a cash provision. ^K^tL.EDUCATION AND SCIENCE8. On the education and science programme, about which further detailsare provided in Annex C, there are the following two specific issuesfor consideration by the Cabinet:i.      Student GrantsThe Cabinet will wish to consider whether the change%.^fcosedby the Secretary of State for Education and Science ar^ ^^politically acceptable.    Some of our supporters will object tothe proposed increases in parental contributions and to ro^Jj^reduction in the minimum award.    Students will criticise tT^J^r~sBgj ,.m
|    SECRET |reduction in the real value of awards that will ensue unless HH^^^^ inflation is lower than now assumed.   But MISC 99 believethat savings are essential; and that the Secretary of State^k^A f r Education and Science&apos;s proposals are the best that canbe devised.   We commend them accordingly to the Cabinet.wZk ....4P^^^   11.    University Current Expenditure^J^ISC 99 believe that reductions in university current expenditureof  50 million in 1986-87 are feasible.   Baseline provision forthis item is nearly  1,450 million.   The Secretary of State forEducation and Science himself agrees that reductions are feasible,though not on this scale: and he considers that any savings thatmay be^^hievable should be used to offset unavoidable costincrAT^ and to fund improved provision elsewhere in theeducation programme.   He also believes that the reductions weproposbe regarded as inconsistent with an assurance givenby the F^^^^LLnister during the Election campaign. However,MISC 99 recommend that the reductions should be made and theprogramme reduced accordingly.OVERALL POSITION ^jfk9. The figures for all the programmes so far agreed, including thoseon which the Chief Secr^ary, Treasury reported agreement in his minuteof 18 October are set out in Annex D.    If our recommendations oneducation and science are accepted, then the total of programmes andreserve will be  126,469 million in 1984-85;  132,530 million in1985-86; and  137,537 million in |gj 6-87.   These differ from theexisting planning totals for 1984-85 and 1985-86 by  129 million and 392 million respectively; and from the survey baseline in 1986-87 by 290 million.    Treasury Ministers consider that these gaps can bebridged, though admittedly with dinfc^^w.    They will report in moredetail orally to the Cabinet. ^W^A.BREAKDOWN BETWEEN CAPITAL AND CURRENT EXPENDITURE10. The Chief Secretary, Treasury was invlSl^y the Cabinet on20 October to ensure that information was available on the distributionof current and capital expenditure.

We thought that this was unlikely to be acceptable to our colleagues,and invited t^^^Acetary of State to advance alternative proposals. Inreply, he indicl^l^^hat he would be willing to accept the following, inifl^ Preference to any ^|fcmative savings in the programme.(a) Halving t^feg^^Lmum award from  410 a year to  205 a year.(b) Steepening the scale of parental contributions.   At present nocontribution is pay^pfe^Lf residual income (i.e income after deductionii&quot;* of allowances such as jAgage interest) is less than  7,100;     1 in&gt; d  every  7 is payable bIRreen  7,100 and  9,000;    1 in  8 between 9,000 and  14,300;   and  1 in  13 thereafter.   The Secretary of Stateproposes that the parental contribution in future at points beyond 9,000 should be  T in every  6.   The effect of this change would be,for example,  that those with res^kial incomes of  12,000 would beJ expected to make a contribution of  770 instead of about  650; andtl&lt;5 those with residual incomes of  18,000 would be asked to pay about 1,770 instead of  1,220. ^P^L^^^^^^(c) The current value of grants sh^^cr^te increased by only 4 per centfor 1984-85, 3 per cent for 1985-86, and 2 per cent for 1986-87,instead of 5 per cent, 4 per cent and 3 per cent respectively.These proposals would produce savings of  25 ot^LA.  45 million andat  50 million in the three years under discussion. ^p^Jjelieve that they areB&gt;e&apos; Politically and otherwise defensible and commend Them to our colleagues.Overall recommendationsy In view of the difficulties which the Secretary of State fag^ducation andd Science faces in his programme, the Group do not think thfcAm should berequired to find further savings to offset the agreed changes outlined inParagraph 2 of this Annex.

 ^1SECRET^ ANNEX ESECRETcl ?CAPITAL AND CURRENT EXPENDITUREAt its meeting on 20 October the Cabinet asked the Chief Secretary tobring before the^|abinet information on the distribution of publicexpenditure as betyeen capital and current expenditure, and the effecton this distribution of the reductions agreed in the 1983 Public ExpenditureBefore the 1983 Survfc^ panned capital expenditure represented some 10  percent of total public expenditure in each of the three years 1984-85,1985-86 and 1986-87.   The Treasury has carried out an analysis, with thehelp of spending Departments, of the changes to these percentages whichresult from decisions so ak^Sfeen in the Survey.    Most Departments arenot yet able to say how the changes agreed for their programmes will affecttheir capital/current ratioIt is not yet possible, therefore, tocalculate how the aggregate percentages above will be changed by theSurvey.In the areas in which the distributionjfcf agreed changes between capitaland current has already been decidedfc ^changes go in both directions:for example, the additions agreed for the Prison Building programme willincrease the Home Office capital spending programme, and the reductionsagreed for the Departments of EmploymentTaBr^palth and Social SecurityWlH reduce their current spending and ad^^)^ pital.    The Housing reductions,however, will show wholly as large capital cuts, although some  300 million f the total represents council house sales whj^^count as negative capitalexpenditure.   There are, too, large increases &quot;in current local authorityspending.   Against this, almost all of any lowea^^d^sion which is agreedror defence expenditure will go towards reducing the proportion of totalexpenditure classified as current. ~^ 1    SECRET &quot;1 n *; BI &apos; &apos;______ s i \)
