I    secret    | HA DEFENCE SUPPRESSION WEAPON FOR THE ROYAL AIR FORCENote by Officialsne IWyaak^r Force have a requirement for a missile capable of suppressingthe radars and electronic components of missile defences. Without such amissile the new Tornado aircraft, which from 1985 will be equipped with theairfield attack weapon JP233, will be unable to penetrate the air defenceswhich the Wars^i^^act is expected to deploy without suffering very highattrition rates.. The requirement ^Lfwv750 missiles, possibly increasing to over 1,000 iffunds are available. 4^The United States also^plJk to deploy aircraft equipped with moderndefence suppression weapons.^Other NATO countries have expressed interestln such weapons, but none has yet taken a decision.SEtions J(hkThe choice is between two missiles &quot;^^^^a* HARM is a missile already developed ^^^kUnited States which will beProduced for the US Forces by Texas Instruments. Proposals have beenmade under which an element of final development .and a substantial partof production to meet a British order would be^cjJ^d out in the Unitedkingdom by British firms under the leadership of Lucas Aerospace, thoughthe high technology homing head would be supplied entirely from theUnited States. The cost of 750 missiles would be  254m (all figures in1982/83 prices); of this 53% would be on a fixed price basfeffi^id the finalPrice paid for the remaining 47% would be the same as the US Forceswould pay. The cost for 1,000 missiles would be f,309m. The^S^kmatesassume an exchange rate of  1 - $1.59. Under the original o%|A|uchy assumed a firm order being placed by 1 April 1983, sufficient missfjg r? ^ an initial operational capability could have been delivered by Septemberr \K ?I    secret    I o Ii fc^-M 1 -1 ......1 i: ,&lt;

Texas Instruments have advised that these dates now^fhave to be slipped in step with the delay in signing the contract, whichwould mean an ISD of January 1987. It would be possible to purchaseHARM entirely from the United States at a slightly lower cost, estimateda^j^Jm for 750 missiles or  292m for 1,000 missiles, though with a fixedprio^ertment of only 10%; but since the cost saving would be small andthere would be no involvement of British industry, this option is notconsidered further.b. ALARM l^ftj^ssile which would be developed by British AerospaceDynamics in conjunction with Marconi Space and Defence Systems (part ofGEO, Thorn-EMI aJTlher firms. Some early development work has beendone at both the firms&apos; and Government expense and British Aerospace?? have offered a fixed p fr|velopment and production contract at a totalH cost  of  U88m  for  750^1^3  and  426m  for  1,000   missiles. Thecontract would provide for^Tirst 100 missiles to be delivered by August1987 and for deliveries to be complete by September 1989.   Failure to? deliver  the  first  100 missiles on time would render British Aerospaceliable to liquidated damages of up |4|.5ra (a similar premium would beH payable by the Ministry of Defence fd^A delivery).Uncertainties5. The choice of missile is complicated by a nudfejof uncertainties. Theseaffect delivery and operational capability, final cost and export potential.6. Sharing the order between HARM and ALARM woul^ethe most expensivecourse of all, and we have not considered it further in this paper.Delivery and Operational Capability 4t7. The Americans have demonstrated that HARM works, but tM^fcile ^not necessarily be capable of dealing with improvements in ^S^PaCtdefences in the 1990s without itself being improved. ALARM iCtJlfundeveloped,  but the concept is more advanced than HARM:    it incorp^JL j? the latest technology, particularly in software, and &quot;would therefore be I2I |    secret ~~| ^^^^^^
I    secret |id ^j^Peadily capable of being enhanced to deal with improvements in Warsaw Pactw ^^^ences in the 1990s (although there must also be some uncertainty as to howh ^^^hreat develops and what will be needed to meet it).   We should be able toe develop it to meet our own requirements and should not be dependent onrj lmProvements which the Americans might decide to introduce in HARM.i &apos;   But there must be a question mark over the ability of British Aerospacet and its sub-contractors to develop ALARM to an acceptable standard in thefour years which they have allowed.   Past experience of weapon developments,both in the Unitag^Kingdom and the United States, suggest that a six-year&gt; development   programme   would   be   more   realistic.       The contractor&apos;sdevelopment plan is based on optimistic assumptions and allows virtually notime for the solution ^^V^y serious problems that arise. There is a risk ofsome slippage in deliveries. This has to be weighed against the financiallncentive on the firms to deliver on time and the need to supply the RAF withan operationally fully acceptable weapon. If nevertheless delays occurred andthe RAF had to face a conflj^^without an adequate weapon, it would takebetween 6 and 12 months, assuming full US co-operation, to adapt the RAFTornado to operate HARM.9*   On final cost the ALARM programme\i^^e face of it has a greater degreecertainty than HARM, since 97% of the^Jl&amp;would be on a fixed price basisSubject.   only   to   increases   due   to  inflat^mT#  As  is  usual  under sucharrangements, it is the contractor who would be liable for all increases inC st Caused by delays or failures on his part to meet the agreed programme;this could cost him up to  3m for every month o^^u^k   British Aerospacec uld be expected to exploit every opportunity to df^mrn the fixed pricec ntract, but the Ministry of Defence would be obliged to meet additional. sts if, an(j Qnjy ^ delays arose from Government failure to provide trials0r other facilities.    If the total number of missiles ordered byRAF werencreased, the cost differential would fall: for example, if 2,000 missiles wereb ught the extra cost of ALARM over HARM would fall from  134m to  70m.I I    secret    I 1C3^|
I I    secret |\^^^0. The final price of HARM is not within our control, since we should have to^^^y the same price for the seeker head, which would be manufactured in theWru ed States, as would be paid by the United States Forces themselves. ^cost could therefore increase if improvements were introduced to meetrequirements of the US Forces, or be reduced if the US Department ofDefence Amre savings in the price. The cost differential between HARM andALARM 4s&amp;so subject to fluctuations in the real exchange rate of the  against the dollar. For a 5 per cent change in the rate the cost differentialon 750 missiles would change by about  10m.11. Export prospects are also unclear.    If the UK purchased HARM, Lucaswould have an excellent opportunity to export the components which they wouldbe making in Britain ^^Me United States for incorporation in missiles whichwould be assembled ther^i^^ delivery to US Forces and to export customerSfor HARM.    They would have the right to compete with US suppliers fordomestic and export sales e%ecj|d to total 25,000 missiles.   Their sharethe work, providing they were c^npetitive, has been estimated at about 10 Percent,   equivalent  to  1,550  missiles.     Prospects  for exports of ALARM aruncertain.   HARM will be a powerful rival, particularly for those countries whoalready have United States    aircraft ayflkssiles: and the UK&apos;s past successrate   in   selling   British  weaponry   against  direct  US  competition isencouraging.   The Ministry of Defence bel^^tat British Aerospace could abest hope to win some 25-30 per cent of tllttmjrl country market, ie sonfl1,250-1,500 missiles.   The Treasury judge it more likely that there would *&gt;eno export business for ALARM, particularly if it proves to be uncompetitivetime and price. ^^^F^Technological factors ^12. The development of ALARM would be one way to retain in the Uni ^Kingdom a capability in homing-head technology. Marconi is lfr^%1^ ^ ^firm with this capability. They have successfully developed a numbermissiles and are at present engaged in completing the h^^&apos;^Sr^S-^eairborne anti-ship missile Sea Eagle. The ALARM programme wou^gPMLcontinuity and keep the present development team together.4secret ~~ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Homing-head technology will be of great and increasing importance in ?weapon   systems   as   the  emphasis   switches   to  &quot;fire  and forgetC%1 -   Their vaiue was demonstrated in the Falkland* conflict (Exocet ,smissile) hut will be even more vita! in the sophisticated electron. M1 environment in which NATO would have to fight any future battle against the Mi WarslJ^^\ 14. There is no real risK in the foreseeable future that the United States willeither cease developing weapons of this sort or would refuse to. major NATO ally such as the United Kingdom.    The Ministry of Defencenevertheless judfe it H^&apos;ial  &quot; de en0e *  ^ *  -&quot; I1 .     homing-head and ^ded missile technological base.    Moreover, if BnUshindustry loses Suc7Qbability it will become progressively less able tocompete in the markeTOJpdern weapon systems both for our own forcesand for export.15. The Ministry of Defence Coders that much the most effective way tomaintain this capability would be to develop and manufacture ALARM. No otherPrograms using anti-radar technology is ready to go into development: inabsence, therefore, of an order^ ALARM the expertise in Bratishindustry would be endangered and perhaps lost. The Treasury, on the other^d, believe that it would be possible JcM^rve the capability in Britishindustry for relatively modest expenditure, ^gftjgss than the extra cost ofALARM over HARM, by bringing forward national work on other future missileProjects and by financing a supporting programme in key aspects of missiletechnology. The Department of Trade and Industr* c^der that a decisionin favour of ALARM would be an excellent example^ a public purchaser^Porting important technology and would be consistent with the Government&apos;sPolicy of buying British when British industry is competitive in terms of pnce,Performance and technology. ^^5^.16 . Another possibility would be to seek British participation in^^f*anProgramme to develop an improved homing-head for HARM.   But prospects arehignly uncertain.   Much depends on the nature and timing of the improvements*hich the US Forces  will want.     We  cannot  therefore know whetherW^X , Programme   could  provide   development work for  which Marconi would ^e^stable.   There could be technical problems in integrating a British hommg-4 I    secret   1 -^^^^^B
I 1 SECRET^J^^head into an American missile, particularly as there would probably be^R^ommercial and political obstances to overcome in this highly competitive a^se^sitive area of defence technology. In order to protect their technology-the US Government have already stipulated that we may only have the existingHARM homing-head through Government channels and that we would have toretuJ^t^) the United States for repair. The judgement of HM Embassy iWashing^TOis that the chances of Marconi attaining any significant share man American homing-head development programme are doubtful.Industrial considerations17. The ALARM programme would generate some 9,400 man years of work over7 years in British5industry.   The employment would be mainly in the Londonarea, the South of Er^u^and Lancashire.   HARM would generate some 3,50 man years of work over 8 years, mainly in Lancashire and the West MidlandsIn both cases, the value of export potential in job terms is assessed as abou5,000 man years, but the ca^juaj|n is difficult and cannot be stated with anygreat precision.    In the conHxt purely of employment considerations,Treasury point out that, leaving aside the uncertain export prospects, eadditional man-year bought by purchasing ALARM would cost approxwia 25,000 (about 10 times the cost per  tfkyear of the Government&apos;s speemployment measures). ^^aiW.? yi^18. The Treasury also point out that the^a^jag of  134m if HARM werepreferred   to   ALARM   would   remain   available^^^the  defence budgetpurchases of other defence equipment, and ord^ H^uld be expected to ^primarily to British industry (over 90 per cent       defence procurementplaced in the UK).Budgetary considerations--- J&gt;_.   t  l34nl19. On the basis of present estimates the ALARM programme would cosmore than HARM, a margin of some 55 per cent.   The extra cost ot ^falls primarily in the PES years  1984-85  to 1986-87.    To acco^jM-^f ^extra costs would require programme changes in other areas. Nev^tf^flLon the basis of the Government&apos;s existing commitment to 3 per cent grodefence  expenditure  up to and including 1985-86,  the Ministry of De 4kyet*believe  that  they can absorb the extra costs,  amounting to  40m a j jwithout substantial detriment to the rest of the programme.I |    SEfcRET    | ^^^^^^

I I secretConclusion^^^kThe choice to be made turns on four key factors, and a judgement has to^^^^ade  about  the  weight  to be attached to them individually and in theroJ^^They are:I ^(a) ^P%ational capability (in the short and in the longer term);(b) cost and budgetary aspects;(c) importance of indigenous technological capability;(d) the international dimension.24. On operational capability the main questions are:(a) in the long term ALARM can be more readily enhanced to deal wiimprovements on Warsaw Pact defences: decisions on improvemto HARM will be in the hands of the Americans (paragraph 7);(b) in the short term the risks involved in the development of ALA^could lead to a period when the RAF&apos;s ability to penetrate W&amp;rSPact defences would be reduced (paragraph 8).25. The cost and budgetary aspects can be summarised as follows -(a) at present prices, HARM costs  134m less tt^g^^LARM: the final o difference could be less or more depending on relative inflation in. theUSA   and   UK,   exchange   rate   movements   and   changes 1requirement (paragraphs 9-10);defence(b) purchasing ALARM would put  some  extra pressure  on tne^^HfeangeSbudget in the PES years and could involve defence programj^in other areas (paragraph 19).I V8H |    secret    | ^^^^
I    SECRET    | HwR^* The importance of indigenous technological capability, together with the^j^W^ted question whether the ALARM programme is the best way of retaining it,e ^Bjkmatter on which Departments differ.   The important area is the homing-ead. Departments agree that homing-head and guidance technology will be oflncreasing importance in modern weapon systems. They disagree on whetherthe ^AJjpLprogramme represents the only effective way of preserving thetechnology and the weight to be attached to the economic and industrialfactors (paragraphs 12-16).&apos; Tne international dimension consists primarily in the negative effectswhich a decisionVA^^y ALARM might have on prospective sales of Britishdefence equipment^ffip^nited States (paragraphs 20-22).^^^^^^^^ |    SECRET    | 0 H
