I I confidential! H&lt;Ol) THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTIk ?C(83) 19 COPY NO 81|I;   . 1983&lt;&lt;?VA&gt; CABINET&lt;&gt;^&gt;\ LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1983-84&lt;^/^---\       Memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilH&gt;       - IThe Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee (QL) have consideredthe legislative programme for 1983-84, and this memorandum seeks theCabinet&apos;s agreement to the Committee&apos;s recommendations.   Details of theBills concerne^are given in C(83) 20.2. Earlier\t^ie^vear QL submitted a provisional programme to theCabinet, and tmj Cabinet provisionally agreed it on 14 April(CC(83) 12th ConJrwj&amp;Sbns, Minute 4).    It was to be reviewed in the summer,partly in the lig^c/nF&gt;progress on the two big local government Bills(one on rating and (p* e^ti the abolition of the Greater London Counciland the Metropolitaiv^C^inky Councils).    QL thought that if both theseBills materialised the^^i^X.provisional programme would be too heavy andwould have to be pruned^^Ao that time we were working on the assumptionof a General Election inNE 2^^tumn of 1983 or the spring of 1984, andthe situation has of cour^^p^changed.   We have a rather longer 1983-84Session, but against that we/Mve^to find room for the Bills which fellat the Dissolution, which incMMe^the long and difficult Data Protection,Telecommunications, Housing anuB^t^ding Control, and Police and CriminalEvidence Bills; and we have to Irave/^ short Finance Bill before theSummer Adjournment and, in the aurajBHjjNan Oil Taxation Bill to enactprovisions which were in the FinamTkMJlLl introduced before theDissolution but which had to be dropae^K   One of the big local governmentBills (on rating) will materialise, aira an interim measure on theGreater London Council and the Metropolitan County Councils will benecessary.    Taking everything into account, QL considered that the Billsto which we are inescapably committed make up^a\programme no less heavythan the full provisional programme which QLMSu&amp;Jnitted to the Cabinetearlier this year.   There are also a number   yc 5n^.ingent Bills, some ofwhich will no doubt have to be introduced, andt^asy experience shows&apos;   that further, unforeseen, requirements for legrs-t^U.on will arise.3. Against this background, QL have decided to rei^mtfi^d thelegislative programme set out in the Annex to this memora&amp;dum. Theessential Bills must be enacted, for example because aC&amp;^n&apos;Cernationalcommitments or because permitted borrowing limits woulaXgj^U^wise beexceeded.    The contingent BiTls could become essential ln/dfifraincircumstances.    The list of programme Bills is made up of\kmys }whichfell at the Dissolution and those which were promised in Tn%xjtf e/i&apos;sSpeech, plus an interim Local Government (Greater London and M^irS^olitanCounties) Bill, which is unavoidable, and the Public Services Ty^s^er,_&apos; % Iconfidential] %
^ [confidential] Ha Iof Functions Bill, which is also unavoidable if the privatisationjl/^ programme is not to be delayed.   Of the Scottish Bills, Local GovernmentValuation and Rating (Scotland) and Roads (Scotland) were promised in^v^v        The Queen&apos;s Speech.   Housing (Scotland) is a short measure which can beintroduced in July, and Inshore Fisheries (Scotland) is a relativelyW^j)    uncontroversial measure which can be introduced in the House of Lordsand is suitable for the Scottish Grand Committee.    The Bills in the&lt;^\\6econd Reading Committee list would be introduced only if the Opposition^\xjhad first agreed to raise no objection to their being taken under that&lt;^/p^cedure in the House of Commons.tjfy&apos;^/Sr number of colleagues who proposed Bills for the programme havereluctantly agreed to accept QL&apos;s view that room cannot be found forthefi^^the current Session.   But there are still points outstandingon a rajrfjSr of other Bills:a.^  The Secretary of State for Employment has pressed the casefor a Dock Work Regulation Bill.   QL would have been preparedto recommend that this should be added to the programme if it Icould beM^ThVoduced in July.   But this is not possible, in viewof the wj^^e*ial situation in relation to the Port of LondonAuthority ^kcPuie industry&apos;s talks about industrial arrangements.b. The Secs^iriM^&gt;of State for the Environment has arrangedfor the Crown ^a* tf kPlanning Permission) Bill to be included inthe list of Bilts^op^offering to Private Members who aresuccessful i&apos;n the &gt;^^t.    If this approach proves unsuccessfulhe may ask for the&lt; ^Qinto be introduced as a Governmentmeasure. &apos; Mc. The Secretary of Sfyrff/  or Trade and Industry is consideringwhether the urgency of zna/^e^d to introduce a successor schemeto regional development grant^^s such as to require theintroduction of the Industreal^Efevelopment Bill this Session;he is also considering the u^gj-yieysof the need for theDevelopment of Inventions Bilr^NW^,d. The Secretary of State for Transport attaches importanceto pressing on with, the British Airways and National Bus Companyprivatisation measures (the Transport Bill and the CivilAviation Bill).   He would be ready to comjraie these into asingle Bill. (T )je. The Secretary of State for Scotland x shM the Tourism(Overseas Promotion) (Scotland) Bill to be rR^^duced this. Session, unless it is decided to legislate offi/^aat Britainbasis. HDetails of these Bills are in C(83) 20. ^^^)5.     The point was made at Cabinet on 16 June that in thV-^eund Sessionof this Parliament the Bill to abolish the Greater London \^u^c^n1 andthe Metropolitan County Councils should be introduced right &lt;r yma start;and that it would be desirable to avoid a spillover in the autxmnyf._. %mconfidential! %
^ 1 confidential1984, so that the 1984-85 Session might start earlier than usual. Thisjj/p makes it all the more necessary not to overload the programme for this^y^S. Session.    It is also extremely important that Departments shouldmaintain and where possible improve on the timetables for the preparationof their Bills as set out in C(83) 20.6.
