CONFIDENTIALTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(83) 15 COPY NO 359 May 1983CABINETLOOAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE AND TAXATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentFollowing Cabinet discussion of a report by MISC 79 on 20 January (CC(83) 1stConclusions, Minute 7) there have been further discussions by the Sub-Committee on Local Government Finance (E(LF)) on the reform of rates.    I nowsubmit to colleagues further proposals that have emerged from thosediscussions.2. When we took office in 1979, local government expenditure and manpowerhad risen relentlessly for many years.   We took steps to reverse this trend,and we have had a certain degree of success.    In England, manpower (excludingpolice) has fallen by about 6 per cent.   Numbers employed are now lower thanat any time since 1974.    Moreover despite substantial cuts in rate supportgrant the average level of rate increases has fallen steadily as inflationhas come under control - 6i per cent in 1983-84 as compared with 23 per centin 1980-81.3. But we have a good way to go.    There is still a totally unacceptabledegree of waste and inefficiency in most local authorities of all politicalcomplexions.    Domestic rates form a heavy burden on many households. Jobsin industry are being destroyed by extravagant and irresponsible spendingpolicies, especially by Labour authorities in the urban areas.LIMITS ON RATE INCREASES4. Our experience has shown the major difficulties that can arise fromdirect intervention in the affairs of individual authorities. Nonethelessthe Sub-Committee believe that there is a political imperative to takeaction.    We have therefore concluded that we must now commit ourselves tointroduce legislation in 1983-84 which will enable us to protect ratepayers -domestic and non-domestic - from the quite unreasonable demands of thehighest spending authorities.    This would take effect from 1 April 1985. Atthe same time, I believe that we should be ready to introduce a generalscheme of control to protect all ratepayers subsequently in place of theselective scheme if the latter does not have the desired effect. Theseproposals would be put in the context of a general commitment by theGovernment to do its utmost to limit local authority rates and expenditure.We might need to introduce further legislation in 1984-85 to enable us totake over - perhaps through commissioners - the functions of authoritieswhich through determined challenge to the scheme defaulted on theirstatutory obligations.. CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSELECTIVE SCHEME OF CONTROL5. A scheme of selective control would be aimed at the authorities with thehighest levels of spending.   We would examine all authorities againstpublished criteria.    Those whose levels of expenditure exceeded the limitsset by the criteria would be required to submit their budgets for mydetailed scrutiny not later than the autumn preceding the next financialyear.    I would be empowered to limit, forbid, or reduce prospective rateincreases for these authorities after discussion with them.   My decisions, incases where I overruled the authority, would have to be subject toParliamentary approval; and it would be desirable to provide for the ratesset in this way to be incorporated in a single Order.6. If a selective scheme had been applied to only the &quot;top 15&quot; authoritiesin 1983-84 chosen by reference to spending levels and rate increases itwould have protected 4 million out of 17  million domestic ratepayers inEngland, as well as the non-domestic ratepayers in these areas (see Annex A).It is worth noting that despite a 3 per cent reduction in the Exchequergrant in Great Britain between 1982-83 and 1983-84, if these authorities hadmet their spending targets this year, the average rate increase over thewhole of the country would have been about 1 per cent rather than about6 per cent.7. I believe that other authorities would have a strong desire to stay wellclear of the risk of such intervention as our powers would permit.GENERAL SCHEME OF CONTROL8. The presentational attractions of a general scheme, in which we wouldimpose a strict limit on the rate increase of all authorities each year, areclear.    To be attractive, the limit would certainly need to be at or belowthe rate of inflation, and apply to every local authority, whether a highspender or low spender.    There would need to be a system of derogations tomeet special circumstances, and statutory specification of criteria andeligible items designed to help reduce significantly the number of applica-tions for derogations; to enable me to reject applications more readily; andto give a better chance of success in resisting legal challenges.9. The Attorney General has advised that the risk of successful legalchallenge in individual cases is marginally less in the general than theselective scheme, because the onus of proof would rest on the local authority. IBut there could be no guarantee that the general scheme criteria would providea sufficient deterrent to keep the number of applications and legalchallenges down to manageable proportions in terms of avoiding error andsuccessful legal challenge.    I must also advise colleagues that in ourdiscussions the Minister for Local Government has stated his strong beliefthat a general scheme, applicable to authorities of all persuasions, wouldalienate the majority of our supporters in local government.   There is thefurther question whether a scheme implying control of all local authoritieswould be easy to legislate - not least in the House of Lords.10. In view of these reservations, I believe that it would be unwise to tryto introduce a general scheme of control straightaway.   However I see theadvantage in being ready to take powers in the legislation to introduce ageneral scheme of control, in due course, if the selective scheme does notpromote effective self-discipline and restraint by local government as a2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwhole.    I believe that a Bill on these lines would be likely to have aneasier passage than one which provided only for a general scheme.11. Any legislation on the control of rates will certainly shift theboundaries between central and local government in favour of the former.But the argument to justify this approach is that the traditional relation-ship between central and local government, in which local governmentaccepted a responsibility to achieve the central government&apos;s expenditureplans, is being consciously challenged by a number of local authorities.Moreover the accountability of authorities to their electorates has beenseriously eroded by the development of supplementary benefit and raterebates.12. The legislation providing for a general scheme of control should applyto Great Britain as a whole.    Since a selective scheme of control alreadyoperates in Scotland, that part of the Bill should apply to England andWales only.RATING REFORMS13. MISC 79 made a number of proposals for rating reform, which I have nowreviewed in the light of our more recent discussions in E(LF). Myimmediate proposals are as follows: others can be considered later.14. MISC 79 proposed that we should provide a discount for those domesticratepayers who make relatively little use of local authority services; andthat it should be available to households consisting of a single adultliving alone.    There are 4.3 million of these, and the proposed discount of50 per cent of the rate bill, up to a maximum of  1.50 a week, would costabout  150 million a year.    Annex B shows other possible categories ofbeneficiaries, with the numbers in each and the costs of applying a discountscheme to them.    It has been suggested that a possible addition would be allpensioner households.    This would provide help to 6.7 million households inall at a total net cost of  240 million a year.   However this scheme clearlyraises problems of unfairness between categories.    It was originally proposedas a way to meet one of the obvious criticisms of those facing heavy burdensunder the rating system.    If the decision is to move to mitigate theseburdens by a rate control scheme, I accept that this proposal need not bepursued.15. Each of the main tiers of local government should provide a separatestatement for each ratepayer (with a unified single bill).    Council tenantsshould receive annual rate statements.16. Local authorities should be put under a statutory obligation to consultlocal representatives of industry and commerce before setting rates.17. We should give more businesses the right to pay rates by instalments.18. In addition to these proposals from MISC 79, I propose that we shouldstop the rating of empty industrial property as soon as possible.ABOLITION OF THE GREATER LONDON COUNCIL (GLC) AND THE METROPOLITAN COUNTYCOUNCILS (MCCs)19. In addition to this package I believe that we should commit ourselvesto the abolition of the GLC and the MCCs. They are widely recognised as asuperfluous tier of local government, whose very existence tends to3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL Igenerate extravagant spending proposals. Their abolition will be extremely ^|popular.    I am submitting a separate paper to Cabinet on this subject.FUTURE OF RATES20. Such is the present dissatisfaction with rates that we may still needin the longer term to seek a new supplementary tax or taxes which wouldenable us to place a ceiling on rates, and which could lead to theireventual extinction.    The most satisfactory supplementary taxes would betaxes on expenditure rather than income in order to deal with the bene-ficiaries of the &quot;black economy&quot;.   A very detailed examination has suggestedthat the front-runners are a Local Sales Tax (LST) or a combination of RoadFuel Duty (RFD) and transfer of Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) on cars, motor-cycles and light vans.21. Neither alternative could be introduced before 1988.   But both would beopen to powerful objections from our own supporters.   The many hundreds ofthousands of traders who would be affected by LST would fiercely oppose theadditional administrative and cost burdens and fear the consequences ofcross-border shopping; car owners and residents in rural constituences wouldperceive RFD/VED as an onerous burden.22. I therefore suggest that at this stage we do not more than indicatethat we will still give further consideration to the longer-term future ofrates in the light of the measures now proposed for local government financeand structure.    Colleagues will note the way in which this is referred toobliquely in paragraph 24 below.    I would particularly ask them to lookcarefully at this aspect of the announcement.CONCLUSIONS23. I invite colleagues to agree that we should:a. announce legislation for next Session for a selective scheme ofcontrol to protect ratepayers from the demands of the highest spendingauthorities with effect from 1 April 1985, together with reservepowers to bring in a general scheme if necessary; andb. introduce legislation next Session to reform the rating system asdescribed at paragraphs 14-18.24. I suggest that we announce these decisions, if agreed, in the followingterms:&quot;We have checked the relentless growth of local government. Manpoweris down to the levels of 1974.   But there are a number of grosslyextravagant Labour authorities, indifferent to the problems and needsof domestic and non-domestic ratepayers.    Since no suitable alternativetax could be introduced quickly, we shall introduce legislation to curbexcessive and irresponsible rate increases by high spending councils,and we shall be ready to implement a general scheme of rate control ofall local authorities should this prove necessary.   We shall alsolegislate to make a number of changes to the rating system designed tomake local authorities more accountable to all ratepayers&quot;.T KDepartment of the Environment9 May 19834l CONFIDENTIAL
