SECRET       AND PERSONAL ^-^ V/*L~^. ?THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF EER BPITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(83) 14 COPY NO 349 May 1983CABINETREVIEW BODY REPORTSNote by the Secretary of the CabinetThe Cabinet has to consider what action should be taken in relation tothe recommendations in the following Review Body Reports which haverecently been submitted to the Prime Minister:i. The Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) ReportThis recommends with effect from 1 April 1983 an averageincrease of 7.2 per cent for the armed forces up to therank of Brigadier and equivalent.ii. The Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Review Body (DDRB) ReportThis recommends with effect from 1 April 1983 an averageincrease of 6 per cent over the DDRB&apos;s 1982 recommendedfigures for National Health Service doctors and dentists,together with changes in supplementary payments to takeaccount of the hours worked by junior hospital doctorsand dentists which would raise the average increase forthe whole group by a further 1 per cent;  in addition theDDRB strongly recommend that the abatement originally madeof their recommendations in 1981, which currently amountsto 2.7 per cent, should now be made good.iii. The Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) ReportThis recommends with effect from 1 April 1983 an averageincrease of 6.9 per cent over the TSRB&apos;s 1982 recommendedfigures for the higher Civil Service (Under Secretariesand above), senior officers in the armed forces (MajorGeneral and equivalent and above) and the judiciary; inaddition the TSRB strongly recommend that the abatementof their 1982 recommendations, which currently amountsto slightly less than 5 per cent, should now be madegood.IV.     The Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) Report on ParliamentaryPay and Allowances and Ministerial SalariesThis recommends increases of 30.9 per cent (from  14,170 to 19,000)  in the salary of MPs and increases ranging from28.3 per cent for Parliamentary Secretaries to 47 per cent1SECRET
SECRETfor Cabinet Ministers.    It also makes proposals about thesecretarial and research allowance for MPs; the severancepay and pension arrangements for MPs, including theaccrual rate and the minimum retirement age; the rates ofthe Peers&apos; expenses alowances; and the secretarial allowancefor Ministers and other paid office holders in the Houseof Lords.2. A summary of the salary recommendations relating to the main ranks,grades or office holders is at Annex A.3. Ministers directly concerned meeting under the Prime Minister&apos;schairmanship have considered these recommendations.    Their conclusionsand proposals can be summarised as follows:i. The AFPRB Report should be implemented in full from1 April 1983, in line with the Government&apos;s past practice andcommitment to maintain full comparability of servicemen&apos;s paywith that of their civilian counterparts.    The annual net costof implementing the recommendations in 1983-84 is estimated at 165 million; the Secretary of State for Defence is discussingwith Treasury Ministers the implications of the additional costfor cash limits.ii. The DDRB&apos;s recommended increase for the current year(6 per cent overall, plus a further 1 per cent in respect ofsupplementary payments for junior hospital doctors and dentists)should be implemented from 1 April 1983; and the 2.7 per centabatement standing over from last year should be made goodbefore the 1984 DDRB review, but from 1 January 1984 in order toease the costs within the current financial year.    In decidingto recommend that the abatement should be made good before the&quot; next review, Ministers had regard to:a. the DDRB&apos;s statement that &quot;... it would be difficultto reconcile failure to implement [their recommendations]in full for a third successive year with an independentReview Body system&quot;;b. the probability that, if the abatement was not madegood, the DDRB would resign and that the doctors anddentists would no longer have confidence in the ReviewBody system; andc. the danger of reopening the issue of future payarrangements for the nurses who had been offered a reviewbody on the model of the DDRB.Leaving aside the supplementary payments for junior hospitaldoctors and dentists, the increase on the 1983-84 pay bill,including the effect of restoring the abatement from 1 January1984, is estimated at 6.7 per cent.    The annual cost ofimplementing the recommendations in 1983-84 is estimated at 128 million; the Secretary of State for Social Services isdiscussing with Treasury Ministers how far the additional costcan be accommodated within cash limits.2SECRET        AND PERSONALi ?^4
AND PERSONALSECRETiii. The higher Civil Service, senior service officers and thejudiciary should be dealt with in the same way as the doctorsand dentists: in other words, the TSRB&apos;s recommended increaseof 6.9 per cent for the current year should be implemented from1 April 1983, and the TSRB abatement standing over from lastyear should, like the DDRB abatement, be made good from1 January 1984.    In deciding to recommend that the abatementshould be made good before the next review Ministers had regardto the Prime Minister&apos;s statement of 12 May 1982, in which theGovernment acknowledged that there were sound managementreasons for bringing these salaries up to date quickly and forkeeping them up to date in future, justified the abatementby the need to abate the DDRB increases, andrecognised that the abatement would be one of the factors tobe taken into account by the Review Body in the course of itsnext review.    The average increase for 1983-84, including theeffect of restoring the abatement from 1 January 1984, isestimated at 8.1 per cent.    The cost of implementing theseincreases in 1983-84 is estimated at  4.9 million, and thereforeDepartments should be able to absorb them within cash limits onthe same basis as the additional cost of the main Civil Service( pay settlement.iv. In relation to the TSRB Report on Parliamentary pay andallowances, though it could be said that the recommended  .19,000 forMPs was not out of line with the figure of  12,000 which had beenrecommended by the TSRB and accepted in principle by the Governmentin 1979, the recommended percentage increases for MPs and Ministersare extremely high, and there are many non-salary recommendationswhich will require lengthy and careful study (for example that thepension accrual rate should be set at l/50th rather than l/60th ofpensionable salary).    The Leader of the House was asked on 5 May by.  Mr Edward du Cann MP to consult opinion widely in the House beforethe Government came to a conclusion on the Report. Moreover,although the Select Committee on Members&apos;  Salaries expressed theview that a major review of MPs&apos; salaries should take place in thelast year of a Parliament and be settled by the old Parliament,they recognised &quot;... that there would not be great harm if decisionson occasion had to be left to the new Parliament&quot;.    The proposalis, therefore, that the Report should be published in the weekending 13 May, but that the Government should not announce anyconclusions and should say that, as the Leader of the House hasalready indicated, the Government acknowledges the need to consultwidely in the House before reaching conclusions.    Ministers thoughtit undesirable, however, that no view should be expressed about theexceptionally high increases recommended for Cabinet Ministers, andagreed that the Cabinet should be invited to authorise the PrimeMinister to make it clear that the Cabinet regarded the increasesproposed as far too large and did not intend to accept increases ofanything like this amount.3SECRET         AND PERSONAL^4        ^^^^^^ _&apos;   6 [
AND PERSONALSECRET4. In relation to the three Reports which included a proposed increasefor the current year as compared with last year, Ministers noted thatthis was in the range of 6 to 7 per cent, somewhat higher than thecurrent level of settlements in the economy as a whole (just under 5j percent).    They therefore agreed that the Government would need to consider,in good time before the 1984 round of Reports, how to ensure that theReview Bodies&apos;  recommendations took full account of the Government&apos;spolicies relating to public service pay.    This would be made easier if,in accordance with their recommendations, the abatements carried overfrom previous reviews were made good from 1 January 1984, since thereviews dealing with doctors and dentists and the top salary groups in1984 would then, for the first time for several years, be starting froma clean slate with no back-log to make up.TIMING AND FORM OF ANNOUNCEMENT5. The fact that the Review Body Reports have been received has alreadybeen announced, and it has been promised that the Report on Parliamentarypay and allowances will be published in the course of this week. TheMinisters who met under the Prime Minister&apos;s chairmanship thereforerecommend that all the Reports should be published on the afternoon ofThursday 12 May; that the Prime Minister should announce the Government&apos;sviews on all of them the same afternoon; and that this announcement shouldtake the form of a Written Answer as in May 1982.6.
