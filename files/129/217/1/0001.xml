CONFIDENTIAL|| ^ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(83)  13 COPY NO g ^6 May 1983CABINETABOLITION OF THE GREATER LONDON COUNCILAND THE METROPOLITAN COUNTY COUNCILSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentIn our discussion of the report from MISC 79 on 20 January(CC(83)  1st Conclusions, Minute 7) I was invited to arrange for officialsto carry out further studies of a possible decision to abolish theGreater London Council (GLC) and the Metropolitan County Councils (MCCs).I attach the report on those further studies by the interdepartmentalgroup of officials.A DECISION ON ABOLITION2. I remain convinced that it is right to abolish these councils, asMISC 79 recommended - there is an overwhelming political case for doing so.So far we have devised alternative arrangements involving several jointboards (six in the metropolitan areas and  four  in London) controllingmuch of the existing upper tier expenditure.   This is a less attractivefeature and I suggest we must try to see if we can eliminate some of thesejoint boards by transferring more functions to the boroughs and districts.I am looking again at planning and waste disposal, and I invite colleaguesto consider reviewing the arrangements for their services.    It may benecessary to consider the case for placing any new joint boards undersome form of financial control.3. If colleagues agree to abolition we must also consider the timing ofthe necessary legislation, the form and timing of the announcement of ourdecision (taking account of the need to announce also our decision onpublic transport in London), and the relationship of this decision with ourpossible conclusions on local government finance.TIMETABLE4. The earliest date for abolition to be effective would be 1 April 1986.There are two possible timetables.    If we wanted to legislate in 1983-84we would have to make an early announcement and there would then be a veryshort period in which Ministerial decisions, consultation and draftingwould have to proceed in parallel.   We would need to take account ofrelationships with any legislation on the control of rates while decisionsin that area were being made.    Introduction would be in January 1984 oreven later and Royal Assent in October, too late in the budgetary cycle toget new bodies in place and operating for a transfer of functions on1 April 1985.1CONFIDENTIAL__. _o J
CONFIDENTIAL5. First Parliamentary Counsel has advised that a full year is theminimum desirable period for preparation of legislation.   The Ministerfor Local Government has also strongly emphasised on the basis of hisdirect experience of the 1972-74 reorganisation, the vital importance ofadequate time for proper preparation of the legislation, with particularreference to the need to block any of the kinds of loopholes which led toproblems in the previous reorganisation.    I therefore favour the secondoption, ie   legislation early in the 1984-85 Session.   This timetableleaves more scope for obstruction - for example in the form of enteringinto irresponsible contractual commitments - and we might well need ashort separate Bill in 1983-84 on counter measures.    If colleagues agreewith this timetable we still need to get on quickly with detailed decisionson the reallocation of functions, the composition of the new joint boards,the handling of staff transfer and the approach to countering obstruction;and with preparing a draft White Paper.FINANCIAL AND MANPOWER EFFECTS6. It is extremely difficult to estimate the total savings under the newarrangements because it involves not only savings which should come aboutthrough the abolition of a superfluous tier of local government (oncetransitional costs have been dealt with) but also the removal of thetendency of these authorities to promote extravagant spending policies.CONCLUSIONS7. I invite colleagues to agree that:i. we should abolish the GLC and the MCCs;ii. we should introduce the main legislation in November 1984with the aim of completing the transfer of functions by1 April 1986 but also make contingent preparations for a shortBill on obstruction for the 1983-84 Session;iii. we should announce our proposals fully and beginconsultations not later than October, or earlier if there is aneed to link this with other announcements on local governmentfinance;iv. the detailed decisions needed for the preparation of suchan annoucement should be considered urgently by a group ofcolleagues directly involved, having regard to the officials&apos;report.T KDepartment of the Environment6 May 1983CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE GREATER LONDON COUNCIL AND THE METROPOLITAN COUNTY COUNCILSNote by the Chairman of the Interdepartmental Group of Officials1. The attached report by the interdepartmental group of officials fulfils theremit from Cabinet of 20 January to consider further the detailed consequences ofabolishing the Greater London Council  (GLC) and the Metropolitan County Councils(MCCs) in order to shorten so far as possible later stages of work if a decision toproceed were taken.2. The Group have made some further progress in identifying and proposingpossible solutions to a number of important issues which arise on abolition. Butthey have concluded that in practice little more can be done prior to any publicannouncement to shorten the period for preparation of legislation,  primarily becausefurther work will require consultation with the local authorities concerned on &quot; Idetailed implications for new arrangements for the services affected. It shouldhowever be possible to move more quickly to a full public announcement thanpreviously although this would involve Ministers making urgent decisions on theissues identified in paragraph 6 below.Legislative Timetable3-       As regards the timing of legislation, the Group note that there are twooptions (paragraphs 5.7-5.10).(a)    Legislation in 1983/84 would require an immediate decision in principleand public announcement,  followed by detailed decisions on the issues listedbelow, and urgent consultation with the local authority associations and otherbodies concerned. There would however be so little time for consultation thatany Bill introduced in 1983/84 would almost certainly require substantialamendment during its passage. Furthermore the Bill could not be drafted untilthe final  form of any legislation onrates control now being considered byE(LF) was clearly established. On the other hand legislation in 1983/84 wouldreduce the scope for obstruction in the form of irresponsible behaviour by theauthorities affected.CONFIDENTIALIO ?
CONFIDENTIAL(b)   Legislation in 1984/5 would give more time for consultation and draftingof the Bill and so reduce the risk of substantial amendment during itsprogress.4. If legislation were attempted in 1983/4 it would be unlikely to gain RoyalAssent until end October 1984 leaving too little time to set up the new bodies totake over on 1 April 1985.  So under both options  the earliest date for the transferof functions would be 1 April 1986, and in both cases there would be some risk thatobstruction could cause the transfer to slip until 1 April 1987.Main Points5. The main points to which I would draw Ministers&apos; attention are as follows:(i) The preferred solutions for the reallocation of functions in the event ofabolition are generally settled, with the major exception of the Inner LondonEducation Authority. Detailed decisions on some services (eg fire in London)would be made after consultation,  and on others in the light of the form ofjoint arrangements being adopted. Decisions would be needed on the role ofland use planning boards in relation to highways and traffic. The decisionalready made on public transport in London has yet to be announced (paragraphs(ii) Several joint boards (ie independent corporate bodies composed ofmembers of districts or boroughs) would be needed in each of these areas andin the metropolitan counties would be responsible for over 60% of the presentcounty expenditure. An important issue would be the arrangements fordetermining the membership of these bodies and the balance to be struckbetween more representative, large bodies and more effective smaller bodies.London would possibly need different arrangements to other areas because ofthe larger number of constituent boroughs (paragraphs 3.8-9).(iii) The need to secure the maximum savings in staff particularly from thecentral administration of these authorities and the multiplicity of preceptsthat would arise suggests consideration might be given to the possibility oflinkage between the various successor bodies (paragraphs 3.10-11). Thepossibility of direct control over staff numbers links with general questions ,6tCONFIDENTIAL
Hj  CONFIDENTIAL  wof control ((v) below); but some form of voluntary guideline and monitoring ofstaff might be the minimum required to secure staff savings.(iv) The practical process of transferring staff would be lengthy andcomplex. Ministers would need to consider the approach to be adopted on theterms of staff transfer to minimise so far as possible the scope forantagonising staff. This would be crucial to the ease with which the wholeexercise might be managed and to the likelihood of securing long term staffsavings (paragraphs 4.2-6).(v) If there were to be separate legislation on the general or selectivecontrol of rates decisions would be needed on the treatment of any jointboards in the control scheme.  If there were no separate legislation on controlMinisters might still consider it necessary to provide for specific controlj  over joint boards.  In either case financial control might reduce the need forany direct control on staff numbers on joint boards, which would in any caseencounter similar legal and other difficulties to a general system of controlon rates (paragraphs 4.11-12).(vi) There is no single simple counter to aspects of potentially obstructive1S                             or mischievious behaviour. The most vulnerable period would be betweenannouncement and the introduction of legislation on abolition and a quickspecific bill might  therefore be needed  in advance of the main legislation egto control commitments to large contracts.  Consideration would have to begiven to the case for not holding the May 1985 elections  for these councilst (paragraphs 4.15-17).(vii) The Group estimate the maximum manpower savings  from abolition of boththe GLC and the MCCs would be between 3,000 and 9,000 staff. The net financialsaving in the first year would be small because of the offsetting costs suchas redundancy, but in later years there might be net savings of  30-120m perannum (1^-6% of current expenditure of these bodies). These estimates arebased on very imperfect data and it would be inadvisable to quote specificfigures.  (Paragraphs 4.18-20).Issues  for early decisionlS 6If Ministers now decide to proceed with abolition decisions would be needed onthe following points.CONFIDENTIAL______ J
j^fl CONFIDENTIAL(a) The form and timing of any announcement.(b) The timing of the introduction of legislation.(c) Subject to those points, detailed decisions would be needed on thoseitems that would form an essential part of any announcement (paragraph 6.1),in particular:(i) either final decisions, or a basis for consultation, on thereallocation of principal functions and the composition of joint boards;(ii) the initial approach to staff transfer;(iii) the approach to handling potential obstruction;(iv) the relationship with any decision on control of rates orexpenditure;(v) the procedure for consultation and the timetable for implementation.7.        Other detailed decisions would be needed very soon after any announcement toenable the legislation to be drafted (paragraph 6.2).T M HEISERDepartment of the Environment29 April 1983CONFIDENTIAL
^ CONFIDENTIALTHE GREATER LONDON COUNCIL AND THE METROPOLITAN COUNTY COUNCILSReport by an Interdepartmental Group of Officials1 . INTRODUCTIONLI     At its meeting on 20 January Cabinet invited the Secretary of State for theEnvironment &quot;to arrange for officials of the Departments concerned to carry outstudies of the detailed consequences of a possible decision to abolish the GreaterLondon Council and the Metropolitan County Councils on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister and to report the conclusions of the studies in due course&quot; (CC(83)1st Conclusions minute 7). The Prime Minister&apos;s summing up indicated that Cabinetwere not yet ready to decide the question of abolition but that the studies  to becarried out should help to shorten the period required for the preparation oflegislation if Cabinet eventually decided on abolition.1-2     The Prime Minister agreed on 1 March that  the work should be completed by theof April and that MISC 79 should remain the forum for discussion of any detailedissues that needed decision during the course of the work. A letter from theSecretary of State for the Environment  to the Home Secretary and other Cabinetcolleagues on 15 March indicated the proposed content of the further work to becarried out by the interdepartmental Group that had undertaken previous studies.1-3     This report therefore:(a) summarises the decisions of Ministers on the reallocation of functions inthe event of abolition;(b) considers issues that arise on the proposed new joint boards includingthe method of selecting members and the need for economical supportarrangement s;(c) considers the methods of implementing the changes in terms of thetransfer of staff and property;  the rearrangement of financial systems; andthe possibility of obstruction;CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2(d) sets out possible timetables for implementation bearing in mind theextent of external consultation and negotiation that would be necessary.1.4     The Group note that there are interactions between the continuing studies onlocal government  finance,  including the possibility of controls on rate levels, andboth the general decision on abolition and particular aspects of the futurearrangements. These are noted at the appropriate points in the report.2fCONFIDENTIAL
j &gt;B CONFIDENTIAL2-       REALLOCATION OF FUNCTIONS2 1.l     Local authorities have a variety of roles in the provision of local services:A. Local authority direct function: the local authority is in control of thepolicy, operations and funding and usually carries out the service throughdirectly employed staff or contractors (eg waste disposal).B. Local authority control limited to policy and finance:  policy and financeremain the responsibility of the authority but day to day operations are thestatutory duty of a separate body (eg public transport).C. Local representation: members of an authority ex offico form part or all f a separate body responsible for the service (eg airports).D. Local funding and administrative support: authorities neither control theservice nor have representation on the controlling bodies but are required toact as a source of funds and to provide administrative and other supportservices (eg probation and after care in MCCs).E. Local funding only: local services can be provided by other bodies with alocally elected authority only involved in the collection of a precept(eg probation and after care in inner London);2.2In the event of abolition these various roles could be taken over by theblowing types of bodies either newly created or existing:(i) existing borough or district councils acting either independently or inco-operation through voluntary joint committees;(ii) new joint boards (ie independent corporate entities controlled byrepresentatives drawn from the appropriate boroughs or districts);(iii) statutory boards appointed by Ministers;^iv)    central government.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL ^ |j2.3 Table 2.1 sets out the existing role of the GLC and of other bodies in theprovision of local services in London together with the expenditure and manpowerused. Table 2.2 indicates  the main decisions already made by Ministers onreallocating these functions in the event of abolition.2.4 Tables 2.3 and 2.4 set out similar details  for the metropolitan countycounciIs.2.5 Full details of the functions of the authorities and their proposedreallocation in the event of abolition are given in Annex 2.1.2.6 There are some services on which decisions have still to be made:(i) The future of ILEA is to be further discussed by Cabinet. In the absenceof Cabinet&apos;s decision this report reflects the majority recommendation ofMISC79 that a single body should be retained.(ii) The Secretary of State for Transport has now decided that there would beno need to set up joint boards to carry out highway or traffic functions. Inboth London and the metropolitan counties all the highways and trafficresponsibilities would be transferred to the boroughs or districts. In Londonthe Secretary of State for Transport would take responsibility for up to about100 miles of the GLC&apos;s roads as part of the trunk road network and would makemore positive use of his reserve/default powers on traffic management.  In theimetropolitan counties the DTp Regional offices would provide any necessarycoordination. The Department of Transport accepts that any joint boardsresponsible for land use planning would have a close interest in transportmatters and would need significant contributions from both the new highwaysauthorities and the public transport authorities. The Department of theEnvironment consider that there is a need for joint boards for strategic landuse planning whether or not such bodies deal with highways or trafficmatters. However in the DOE view such matters form too important a part of theplanning function for the boards not to have at least some responsibility i this field (other than for roads taken over by the Secretary of State forTransport). This responsibility need not include an executive role but somereserve powers might be required to ensure that the boards could secure theimplementation of their strategies. Decisions would thus be needed on the roleof land use planning joint boards in relation to highways and traffic matters.CONFIDENTIAL
P 1^ CONFIDENTIAL(iii) The appropriate arrangements for coroners are the subject of separatereview by the Home Secretary and the Lord Chancellor;(iv) The Minister for the Arts is reviewing the arrangements previouslyenvisaged for arts in London and in particular the South Bank since it may notnow prove feasible to transfer the latter to the Arts Council. Final decisionsmay need to await consultation;(v) Final decisions on the reorganisation of the fire service in London intoone or more boards would be taken after consultation;(vi) Some decisions (eg on trading standards and in particular animal health)might need to be reviewed in the light of Ministers&apos; views on the acceptablee number and composition of joint boards. &apos;2 7The Group previously concluded that some services should be dealt with by amandatory form of a joint committee of districts or boroughs  ie the existence ofe JOlnt arrangements would be required by statute but no separate legal entity would^e created. The Group now consider that such arrangements would have no significant^vantages over a joint board and would have the major disadvantages that the bodyn could not  independently hold property or employ staff and could not be readilyjC Subject to action to enforce the carrying out of a duty.2 o5 Thus two services would need to be dealt with through joint boards rather thanmandat ry joint committees.(i) waste disposal  (one or more boards  in London);(ii) land use planning;  subject  to the issues in 2.6 (ii) above.IOther changes from the decisions recorded in previous reports are:(i)   Airports: the Secretary of State for Trade has concluded that the presentrole of the MCCs in some regional airports would be taken over by districtsPending any wider ranging changes. The precise arrangements could only bedecided after consultation.eCONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL ^Previous assessment2.10 The Group recorded in its previous report (MISC79(82)11) views on theaccountability, effectiveness and efficiency of these replacement arrangements. Insummary, there were only a few services (but some significant ones such as police)in which there would be any necessary loss of effectiveness or efficiency butoverall the arrangements would clearly not have the same direct accountability ofthe present councils. The Group noted that the GLC and MCCs have spent more inexcess of the Government&apos;s plans than other classes of authority and they are notgenerally perceived as having performed well in implementing strategic policies.Giving renewed emphasis to a single primary tier might better link those making andthose implementing strategic policies but there was no basis for deciding whethersuccessor bodies would be more or less likely to spend in accordance with theGovernment&apos;s priorities.2.11 The Group note that specific measures have already been taken to deal withspending on public transport services and that other more general measures forcontrolling rates and thus expenditure are under consideration.The balance between central and local government2.12 The Group note that the GLC are responsible for a narrower range of servicesthan the MCCs and that the new arrangements in London would represent a furthershift in the present balance of responsibilities from local government to the centrein particular through the changes to public transport (ie the new metropolitantransport authority).:!&lt;1CONFIDENTIAL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^ CONFIDENTIAL HH3-       NEW JOINT BOARDS3.1      If abolition were to proceed detailed decisions would be needed on the Hconstitution, powers and other arrangements for any new bodies. Of particularimportance would be joint boards and the way in which the local authority memberswere drawn from the borough and district councils in the area. There are few currentexamples of joint boards running major services:  ILEA is a special hybrid bodyconsisting of both borough and GLC members (totalling 48); joint police authoritiesconsist of members from several counties according to relative population; and thereare joint planning boards  composed of both district  and county members  for some Mnational parks.3-2     The Group assume that Ministers&apos;  aim would be to arrive at boards which were, ?so far as possible,  representative (both of the electorate and of the lower tierauthorities); accountable (at least to the directly elected constituent author-ities); stable in operation; and economical and efficient (implying that they should e as small as is compatible with the other criteria). The following aspects would Hneed to be considered:(i) the allocation of seats between the councils in any area;(ii) the allocation of seats within councils;(iii) the size of the boards; and(iv) the tenure of board members and its interaction with election to the Hcouncils.3&apos;3 Councils forming joint boards would no doubt argue that they should each be jHPresented on such boards. The minimum size for joint boards would therefore be oneeach constituent authority. If the allocation of seats between councils were tore&lt;lect the different size of the councils&apos; electorates larger boards would result.F r some functions there would be additional non-elected members on the boards.P Uce authorities include magistrates (up to one third of the total size) and thePr Posed passenger transport authorities might include some members appointed by the _Secretary of State for Transport.CONFIDENTIAL1 &lt;M
CONFIDENTIAL ^3.4     More complex would be the allocation of seats within councils. There are twomain possibilities:(a) Freedom of choice: each council, ie essentially the majority party, woulddetermine the composition of its representation. This would be simple, couldbe operated with the smallest representative board but would exaggerate thedegree of control by the majority party to the extent of creating a totalmonopoly in some areas.G(b) Guaranteed minority representation: each major party would be given atleast one seat and the remainder distributed either by method (a) or in some GMway to produce representation proportional to the party strength on the &quot;council. This would ensure that the minority parties on the constituent TWcouncils were represented on the joint boards. It would require legislativedefinition of political parties and might involve a role for the courts in -resolving disputes. There would be enlarged boards with at least four seatsfor the smallest council in each area (ie one for each of three parties plusone to allocate to the controlling party). Even that might be insufficient toprovide for cases where parties are fragmented. B 3.5      The size of boards would thus be mainly a consequence of the particulardecisions taken about methods of selecting members. Table 3.1 shows the sizes of ^boards that follow from three methods of allocating seats: -(i) one per district/borough;3.(ii) one for the smallest district/borough plus additions for others in e]proportion to their electorate in comparison with the smallest; Li(iii) four for the smallest plus additions for others in proportion to theirelectorate in comparison with the smallest.But these might need to be reconciled with other approaches to the appropriate si-eof boards for particular functions,  for example the current size of the committeeswithin councils. It might be appropriate for example for the new police joint boardsto be comparable in size to the county police committees (typically around 30,including the magistrates but West Midlands has 21).CONFIDENTIAL

The boards would be  representative  and accountable but might   lack  stability.CONFIDENTIAL^___J_1
CONFIDENTIAL Q ([In each case provision would be needed for by-elections, and in the case of (b)consideration might need to be given to eliminating the &apos;fallow&apos; years created bythe removal of the county tier elections.3.7 The Group conclude that either method would be reasonably satisfactory andthat,  unless Ministers wish to alter the electoral pattern for the basicauthorities  fundamentally,  the appropriate methods would be (a) for London and (b)for the metropolitan counties.Conclusion3.8 Overall the Group conclude that Ministers would need to decide on theallocation of seats between and within councils,  the size of the board and thetenure of members. These.decisions would have a major effect on the style ofoperation and political composition of the boards. The choice in the metropolitant 3counties would probably lie between boards on a range between 25 and 60 or boardsless than 15 depending, service by service on whether the board itself manages theservice directly, or has a different role,  the degree of minority representationwhich would help its effectiveness and the need for co-opted members.  It would bedesirable for the same method to be adopted in each metropolitan county for aparticular service but the different services would probably justify differingtreatment.3.9 London might need special consideration because even a single representativefrom each borough would produce a medium sized board.  Radical alternatives might beconsidered such as requiring all borough councillors to elect small boards (say 1 to 15)  from among themselves but this would be novel and complicated. Finaldecisions would depend on the pattern of services eventually chosen. Joint boardsb((eg fire, waste disposal) might operate over separate parts of Greater London rathed:than the whole area thus avoiding the main difficulty.m:piFurther consideration of joint boards3.10 The Group believe that if joint boards were to be a major feature of any &quot;eWarrangements some further points would need consideration.(i)    If the chosen methods of determining the members of joint boards were tolead to relatively large boards it would be desirable to have as few of themas possible to minimise the load on the members of individual councils.CONFIDENTIAL
r0 CONFIDENTIAL(ii) Each joint board would need some support services of the kind currentlyprovided by common departments within the county council. These services wouldbe the area of greatest potential savings and to maximise the eventual savingsthe new arrangements should be designed to allow for and encourage economicalsupport services.(iii) The executive organisations for some of the services for which a jointboard organisation would be desirable are comparatively small (eg wastedisposal and trading standards). They might not each justify a separatesuperstructure of political and administrative control.?Civ) The presentational effect of a multiplicity of precepting bodies (up to 71n the metropolitan counties) might be undesirable,  and there might beconfusion over responsibilities that could reduce accountability.&apos;ii    Simplification could be achieved in two ways:Ci)    by complete amalgamation of the political and administrative structuresfor two or more services;(ii) by the political and executive parts of a service obtaining all thenecessary administrative support either from another joint board,  from one ofthe districts or boroughs in its areas or by buying in certain services;  it isdifficult in practice to enforce such arrangements.^e ciq *ions on the most appropriate and economical arrangements could only be made inight of detailed information from and consultations with the various bodiesv lved.  Such bodies as the new metropolitan transport authority and any new singler body fn^   &apos; J-or education in inner London would be sufficiently large and have sufficientlystinctive functions to be entirely self sufficient in all respects, but others&quot;i&amp;h tneed to share some facilities  to be economical. Extensive amalgamation couldProduCp k j .      . ?   . .?oaies insufficiently distinct from the present arrangements.??CONFIDENTIAL
I0 ^ CONFIDENTIAL4&gt;       IMPLEMENTATION: MECHANISMS.1     Whatever the precise pattern of replacement bodies decided upon broadlysimi1ar issues would arise in implementing the transition.(a)    The existing staff and property would largely need to be transferred tothe new bodies carrying out continuing functions.(b)The arrangements for capital and current finance would have to beadjusted.(c)    There might be obstruction to any change.Thee Group have considered the legislative and practical mechanisms that might beeeded and the major consequences that arise.-Transfer Qf |H4.2The policy on transferring staff would need to strike a balance between thenflicting objectives of gaining staff co-operation to minimise disruption, andx^mising staff savings from abolition.  The issues are set out in detail in Annex4 1The GLC/MCCs employ approximately 53,000 staff (excluding ILEA,  police and ther i-aw and order staff). Maximum net staff savings from abolition might be in theanSe of 3000-9000,  about half of which would be in central administration. Butlve action would almost certainly be necessary to ensure that staff savingsoccur.4-3     M- .Ministerial control over staff numbers would be possible but very difficult.be effective,  it would have to apply over a long period and to all services ofreceiving authority.  Such extensive direct control might be less necessary ifntrols were imp0ge_ 0n rates, but the administrative and legal drawbacks to directC Otl t&quot; T n 10J--on rates apply, mutatis mutandis,  to control of staff numbers (see 4.11bel0w\ ....it staff control is considered impractical, voluntary staff targets and a^inanei _i . . .-ai system which encouraged compliance with the targets would seem to be theonly f&quot;easible way of promoting staff savings.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL Q ^4.4     The staff attitude towards re-organisation would be affected by the level ofredundancy compensation and the terms offered to transferring staff. Compensationcould be limited to present local government day to day terms, but for those under50, and particularly those in the 41-49 age group these terms are well below thosefor most other public services.  In the 1974 re-organisation the far more generousCrombie Code applied but in 1980 the Government decided not to apply the Code tofuture statutory reorganisations. However, currently local act powers, enable Londonauthorities to pay compensation to all staff at a higher level than the day to day 1terms. Moreover,  some authorities elsewhere purport to use general powers to paygreater benefits to their staff than general local authority terms. This loophole ^.... Gcould give rise to considerable costs in the context of reorganisation.  The Groupconclude that there would be a strong case for including in any legislation measures 8fdisapplymg both London local act powers and any general powers for this exerciseand prescribing the terms which would apply. This would be resented by staff,particularly if the much lower local government terms were to be applied instead. t reduce the scope for antagonising staff, Ministers might wish to consider paying thestaff in the 41-49 age group NHS/NT terms which were above general local governmentterms, but well below Crombie and London local act terms.4.5 To minimise disruption, large numbers of staff (especially in fire and policeservices) would have to be transferred on current  terms and conditions of service.Unions would no doubt press for all staff to&apos; be so transferred thereby carrying thehigher GLC/MCC pay scales into the lower tier authorities and joint boards. To theextent that staff offered lower terms opt instead for redundancy this might increasedisruption and could be costly. An alternative would be to make some provision for4compensation for detriment,  for staff transferred on lower terms.oP4.6 Ministers will wish to note that it would be necessary to consider a packagetof staffing measures comprising:C(i) either control of staff numbers _or_ voluntary targets;50 4(ii) redundancy compensation on local government day to day terms  for thosePand over and those 40 and below;t(iii) redundancy compensation on either local government day to day or NHS/NTSterms for staff between 41 and 49;CONFIDENTIAL^^^^^^^^^^^ 11

InSeveral, property would be transferred to the new authorities taking over theuriction(s) with which it is associated. Transfers would require a straightforward^der-mai,*making power and substantial secondary legislation prepared in closeT nsultation with existing and successor authorities (including shadow joints&gt;- The issues are summarised in Annex 4.2. Ministers will wish to note that itlt: WOuld be necessary:to complete, by re-organisation day,  transfer of the vast majority ofgoperational property to ensure that services will not be disrupted; andI (M    b . .to provide for residuary legatees to hold items unallocated onre-organisation day and to arrange subsequently for their allocation orsS disposal.Transfer would be time consuming, occasionally contentious and vulnerable toction. More work is needed identifying and planning for particular types ofPr pertv ky&gt; out only a limited amount could be done in advance of an announcement andthe detail aiiea work could not begin until the legislation were published.Currer^ &lt;=.rinance and grant50 ^ . 9New bodies taking over functions from the GLC or MCCs would have to beProvidedwith the means to carry them out. The Group have encountered no insuperableechniCal _&quot; .or legal problems. Annex 4.3 discusses these issues in detail.r4,10 The Group&apos;s main conclusions are that:CONFIDENTIAL^_ : M
CONFIDENTIAL Q %(i) appointed bodies should not be given powers to raise their own taxesnor be eligible for Government grant but should rely on central governmentfunding; joint committees would have to rely on sharing costs between theirconstituent authorities;(ii) joint boards should be allowed to raise their own taxes through uniformprecepts on districts/boroughs in their area. Any legislation should make themeligible to receive government grants directly.(iii) a final decision would have to be taken on whether the police and fireboards  received block grant. On the one hand,  it can be argued that blockgrant on account of police and fire services should be paid direct to thedistricts/boroughs within the areas.  Because the districts and boroughsprovide a range of services they would be able to offset more easily anymismatch between GRE&apos;s on fire and police services which might arise becauseof technical shortcomings in the way fire and police service GRE&apos;s aremeasured. On the other hand,  it can be argued that it would be inequitable topass on the consequences of any mismatch between expenditure and grantrelatedexpenditure to rating authorities who would have no control over the fire and 4police boards. There is no need to take an immediate decision on this point.Further development work would have to be commissioned on police and fireGRE1s.4(iv) special arrangements would be needed in London to replace the resourcetransfers  from the City and Westminster to other London Boroughs which areeffected through the GLC (and ILEA) precepts. The Group&apos;s preferred solutionis an extension of the present London Rates Equalization scheme. Anotherpossibility is negative block grant. The problem of dealing with the covertresources transfers within London would be greatly increased if ILEA were tobe broken up.Control4.11   The Group have assumed in their work on current finance and grant that theexisting rating and grant systems would continue. The same principles would applynew taxes were to be introduced,  though their detailed application would need tofurther considered. There are also several  interactions with any control scheme f rrates:CONFIDENTIAL
I(P ^ CONFIDENTIAL H(i) if there were to be general legislation on control of rates, decisionswould be needed on how this might apply to joint boards;(ii) if there were not to be general  legislation on control of rates, itwould be possible for specific controls to be introduced for the joint boards;.mieffl ( ? . ? \^i-i)    any financial control on joint boards would highlight the degree ofcentral responsibility for their expenditure decisions;e / . .\iv;      however,  financial controls would reduce the need for direct controls n staff (see paragraph 4.5). A selective control scheme would by definitiononly apply to high spending/high rating authorities. A general control schemewould apply to a wider range of authorities but how far it could bite on allauthorities subject to change on reorganisation would depend on the tightness f the rate limits and other control factors.CaPital Finance and Debte-d 4.12   tv, ______-ne Group have considered both the arrangements for future capital expenditure^ new bodies and the handling of the debt of the existing authorities. These ared ilScussed in detail in Annex 4.4.The Group conclude:(a) the introduction of a capital expenditure regime for successor bodieswould raise no particular difficulties;(b) in distributing the responsibility for the servicing of the existing?~J__1__&gt; problems of equitable handling might arise in a number of cases, notably111 relation to highways.  Such problems, which should not be insuperable, couldonly be resolved in consultation;^    it would be necessary to retain some form of separate administration of^H__tanding debt.  In the metropolitan counties it should be possible for thisto De done by one of the larger districts, but in London it might be necessary^0r reasons of market confidence and practicality to set up an independentbody for t-^g parp0se.CONFIDENTIAL^^^^^ - m
CONFIDENTIAL   ((d)    Che distribution of reserves would likewise be reasonablystraightforward.  But in this as in other aspects of the distribution ofliabilities and assets it would be vital to avoid action which would upset thebalance of the money and capital markets or undermine their confidence inlocal government generally as a borrower.  In practice,  the problems do notlook insurmountable.4.14 The independent body needed in London might need to have precepting powers andwould therefore preferably be a body set up by the boroughs.Obstruction4.15 The Group have noted previously the possibility that abolition would becontentious and that the members and staff of authorities to be abolished might actto obstruct the change. There would be two main areas of concern:(a) Passive obstruction: authorities might refuse to provide information ornegotiate and this would raise particular difficulties in handling thetransfer of staff and property for which the authorities possess the relevant&apos; . 4detailed information and their active co-operation would be required;aC(b) Mischievious behaviour:  authorities might  take action which would beintended to bind successor authorities to particular policies or commitments.s4.16 A related issue is the handling of the next elections of the whole countycouncils  in all of these areas, which are due to take place in May 1985. This mighc.... abe before the completion of the main primary legislation on abolition.a4.17 The Group have reviewed these issues and the considerations are set out indetail in Annex 4.5. It has not been possible to make any overall assessment of thelikelihood of particular mischievious actions or the determination with whichCipassive obstruction might be undertaken. The Group conclude:diH(i)    that the most vulnerable period would be that between any announcementand the introduction of legislation both because authorities might believethat obstruction would change the Government&apos;s intentions and because specucounter measures could not easily be used or even threatened;CONFIDENTIAL
0 ^ CONFIDENTIAL(ii) that it would be difficult to devise specific forms of counterobstructive action which would be certainly successful but which stopped^e short of complete take over of an authority if it refused all co-operation;(iii) that the 1985 local elections would provide a focus for the politicaldebate over the future of these bodies and for obstructive action; the choiceappears to lie between not holding the elections (and keeping the existingn councillors in office) as has been the practice in previous reorganisations orallowing the elections, to continue with the possibility that the winning partymight claim a mandate for obstruction;(iv) securing the co-operation of staff even more than of elected memberswould be a major factor in ensuring that functions transferred smoothly;(v) a contingency plan for action in the event of obstruction should bedecided upon before any announcement.8ts atu* Savings of Reorganisation4 . 18   m?Ministers would no doubt be pressed soon after any announcement to-give anssment of the savings expected to result from abolition. West Yorkshire CountyCouncil knas already published a paper claiming that abolishing WYCC would give riseto aet cost of  8m pa,  largely because they predict a substantial net increase instaff&gt;4-19 Thne critical  factor would be the level of staff savings achieved since staffare thmajor cost element and indirectly determine other costs such as0[nmodation. If the maximum staff savings of 3,000-9,000 posts were to beachiev H     . ...ca&gt;  the gross annual financial savings on staff from year 1 would be in therange oft  40- 120m, and there would be savings on accommodation of the order ofPa although these might not materialise until year 2 or 3. The main staffs (redundancy compensation, disturbance payments,  possible compensation foretr jment) might be of the order of  20- 70m in year 1 and would then taper offsharpsv* In addition, in year 1 only there would be costs incurred in organising thecbangePerhaps of the order of about  20m. Overall,  there might be a marginalaj- saving in year 1,  increasing to savings perhaps in the range of  30- 120m* -6% of GLC/MCC relevant expenditure) after two or three years.-CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL ^ |4.20    It must be stressed that these estimates are very rough, based on veryimperfect data, relate in the main to costs and savings arising on staff andaccommodation and are based on the assumption that the substantial staff savings of3,000-9,000 will be achieved. Ministers would have to avoid quoting these figuresuntil the exercise were well advanced and,  in particular, until the position onlikely staff savings were clearer. But it would be possible to assert that financialsavings would arise from reductions in staff levels. ]*1&lt;i_____I&amp;VP__H_ca(d. 5dc5_____ Hi-confidentiall_______-_----------------i
0|| ^ CONFIDENTIALIMPLEMENTATION: TIMETABLEif_1 Between four and six weeks would be needed to prepare an announcement after af i _a   decision if most minor issues were left to subsequent detailed consultation.Rather llonger might be needed if more of the details were to be decided before annnouncement.  in any case the Group note that some aspects must be decided on thebasis nf . . r consultation eg the re-allocation of some functions (fire in London, arts,r ners),  the composition of joint boards and the organisation of their support,3nd SOme detailed financial matters._____me primary legislation would be a major complex bill for which the 19740rganisation is only a partial precedent) because it was concerned mainly withalgamation of authorities rather than their sub-division. Although much detailu^d be left to secondary legislation the Bill could not be limited to enablingProvisionions: Parliament would expect full details of new bodies and in any caset^e time would be saved because detailed proposals would need to have been workedout f0pany enabling bill to be drafted.  Ideally at least a year is needed betweennnouncement and the introduction of legislation. This would involve consultation(whickwould in itself be complex to handle) proceeding in parallel with thedraff. ?ln8 of instructions.5.3 &gt;ine organisation of physical transition would be a complex task requiring muchdetaii-H ...ca negotiation;  it could be started before Royal Assent but only on alngent basis. Any new bodies would need to be set up in shadow form quickly..4     Obstruction could affect:the nature but probably not the timing of the primary legislation. Iflittle initial informtion is available the legislation would have to leavem re details to be settled in secondary legislation. At this stage much of thediscussion would be with the lower tier who could be expected to beco-operative;^ii) the length of the transition period: the secondary legislation duringthis period requires much detailed information.  If that were not readilyCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL Q |available transfer might need to be delayed at least one year because therewould be major complications in making transfers other than at the beginningof a financial year.5.5 The additional work undertaken by the Group since January has not signifi-cantly changed the probable timing of the various stages after any announcement asthese are determined primarily by external factors (ie consultation periods andParliamentary sessions) rather than the volume of work.  It should however bepossible to move more quickly to a full announcement than previously.5.6 The Group note that if ILEA were to be broken up the volume of work,particularly in the latter stages would be significantly increased.Overall timetable5.7 The Group assess that the earliest feasible date for the transfer of functioflSis 1 April 1986. This applies whether legislation were to be introduced in the1983/84 session or 1984/85 session. If legislation were attempted in 1983/84 itwould be unlikely to gain Royal Assent&apos;before November 1984,  leaving too little timefor new bodies to be set up and transition to be accomplished by 1 April 1985.Legislation introduced early in the 1984/85 session would have to be completed byJune 1985 to leave time for transition by 1 April 1986.5.8 To legislate in 1983/84 would impose an extremely tight timetable. Thedecision to abolish would have to be taken now and announced very quickly andMinisters would have to take many supplementary decisions soon. The close links withany legislation on rates control mean that Ministers would have to take cleardecisions on the final form of that legislation before instructions on the aboliti00legislation could be finalised. There would be little time for consultation oneither legislation, little opportunity to win the co-operation of reluctantreceiving authorities by involving them in the decision process and there would behigh risk of errors. There would however be more time for detailed secondarylegislation. Counter obstruction measures would be in place earlier which mightreduce the scope for obstruction, but it could still be. a major problem.5.9 Legislation in 1984/85 would give much more time for consultation and thepassage of the legislation, and the risk of errors would be substantially reduced.Obstruction might be greater but there would be more opportunity to gain theCONFIDENTIAL

Appendix A sets out background inform-ati n on n,^ tne staffing levels of the GLC and MCCs. The future arrangements for ILEAyet t~ kc  be decided;  this paper does not, therefore, cover its staffing aspects.2. Staffing issues would be transitional but they would be complex and critically&quot;.Porta&quot;, to the success of the changeover. It would be essential that the staffc         enerally cooperate with the exercise.

More recently in the 1982 NHS reorganisation, operational staff wereunaffected, and almost all administrative and managerial staff transferred &lt;-new District Authorities to await posting. As the Districts develop their m3&quot; 0structures within close, continuing and increasingly detailed DHSS controlsmanpower, staff savings are being sought. Staff are competing for the posts$t- verynew structure. Staff losses are to be largely accommodated by natural wastag &gt; ^the pay of down-graded staff is to be protected for 5-10 years after which thedeterprotection tapers off.a^tho7. In the present exercise Ministers would need to decide whether they wis*16 ^ take positive steps to secure savings or whether they were prepared to leavesavings to emerge as a result of the staffing policies of the new bodies anamind&apos;      the C(authorities inheriting the GLC/MCC services. Two factors need to be borne i&quot;ateasstaff8. First, the scope for staff savings Is relatively limited. To minimisedisruption, staff in the major services (fire, police) would have to be transe Pren bloc by order to the proposed joint boards and there would be no scope f rsavings in these services&apos;.

confidentialIANNEX 4.2TRANSFER OF PROPERTYProduct ionl       The Group considered the issues that would arise on the trasfer of property.Al1 Property (or interests in property) owned by MCCs and the GLC would need to betransferred to successor bodies. Property here includes: land; buildings; vehiclesand other equipment; records, books, stores and computer and other files; rightsRising from contracts and agreements; notices and causes of actions etc; and utstanding balances and loan debts.2&quot;      The basic principle must be that property wholly or mainly used for aParticular services would go to the authority to which the function was beingtransferred, but special arrangements would be needed for transfers which involvedePartures from the basic principle.3*      Property transfer would be laborious and complex, but it should not, ofltself, give rise to much controversy except in the case of very large assets withn  clear destination. The objective must be to iron out before re-organisation dayas ^ny difficulties as possible in negotiations between the expiring and successorattem of Transfer4*      The following seem likely to be the most common forms of transfer:(a) single use property to single successor bodies (usually joint boards) egPolice and fire service; London flood protection; waste disposal in MCCs;(b) single use property to single successor authorities operating on behalfof several authorities (a &quot;lead&quot; district for a joint committee or under anagency agreement): eg civil defence HQs; perhaps laboratories and computerhardware; and(c) single use properties to the successor authorities in which they arelocated: eg highways; smallholdings; recreation and parks; perhaps London(Thamesmead) housing.CONFIDENTIALn -jil6 ?
CONFIDENTIAL ^5.       Multi use properties would present particular problems. In a number of casesthe property would have a clear destination, with a predominant service or group ^services going to one successor body, subject to negotiated safeguards for theminority users. But some would have no clear destination or would have no continuefunction after abolition day, and complex negotiations or temporary arrangementswould be needed. Some administration headquarters would fall into this group anaissue of their disposal, particularly the GLC&apos;s County Hall, would be likely togenerate a good deal of publicity. Single establishments using sites in more thanone borough (eg many of ILEA&apos;s further and higher education colleges) also presentproblems.6.       Further consideration would be needed of particular problems arising in &gt;relation to:computer software and files; 9_municipal airports; t Ca]waste disposal contracts in London; 0_(law and order services other, than police; and iteducational establishments in inner London.10,Transfer Machinery , &apos;s apWen7.       Re-organisation would involve too many and too varied properties to rely  n tonormal conveyancing. Instead, as in 1974, the appropriate mechanism would be ptclegislated transfer, requiring three components: &apos; amc(a) a power to make orders transferring property; Ut(b) transfer order(s) identifying the originating and destination author^and the functions and consequential classes of property passing between then1&apos;andI(c) a schedule dealing with property which does not fit into the classesspecified in the order, identifying the property and its destination. 12,The preparation of (b) and (c) could only take place after detailed discussions r w0lJbetween the expiring and successor authorities. Quick and efficient transfer would ^depend on gaining full co-operation from the staff of these authorities; this istherefore one of the areas vulnerable to obstructive action.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALes Inevitably, some property might remain unallocated on re-organisation day, andof ^rgnsltional arrangements would be needed to establish residuary legatees to take0ver such property from that day until it was either transferred to its finaluing        receiving authority or disposed of. The options are:the (i)   to make the districts or boroughs residuary legatees for unallocatedproperty located in their area; orJt (ii) to make statutory provision for a temporary &quot;residuary legatee&quot; for eachMCC and the GLC; or(iii) a combination of (i) and (ii) whereby a temporary legatee took overimportant and controversial property leaving the districts and boroughs asresiduary legatees for remaining unallocated property.9&apos;      Option (i) would involve splitting the task among 68 authorities; It would&apos;     Carry the risk of putting some important properties into inappropriate hands, and0nce some authorities had -acquired a property they might be reluctant to dispose ofit.l0.     The legatee under option (ii) could be either a special Board or CommissionapPointed by the Secretary of State or the Secretary of State himself. The legateeWould have to have powers to handle the property and the money and to employ staffto undertake the considerable amounts of detailed work involved in dealing with thePr Perty. But this would involve the legatee in dispersing or disposing of a vastaia unt of relatively minor property.U&quot;     Option (iii) would overcome this problem since unallocated minor propertyieS   j    W uid become the responsibility of the districts and boroughs which in any caseWould be likely to be the eventual recipients. On balance, option (iii) seems toer the best solution.StableIl2.     Property transfer would be time-consuming, even if there was full co-operationft m the local authority staff concerned.

At this stage it is impossible to estimate how long property transfer wiltake. Although the six MCCs would at least start with the 1974 Orders and Schedule&apos;the present exercise would involve dividing their property among nearly 50 succbodies. The GLC property would have to be divided among at least 40 bodies.

Expenditure targets and holdback:   Would these be applied to the neWbodies, assuming they continue in future?Access to Local Taxes5.       The Group have identified two criteria which should be fulfilled by asuccessor authority if it were to be allowed to levy a local tax. First, the botfshould exercise independent responsibility for the provision of a local service*Second, it should be directly or indirectly electorally accountable for theprovision of the service. These criteria have been applied to each of the like^forms of successor bodies.*i.     Appointed bodies (eg new metropolitan transport authority). These bod*would not be electorally accountable to the population they serve. 0nthat basis, they should not be given taxation powers. There areprecedents for appointed bodies to issue precepts, mainly WaterAuthorities, and the Receiver for the Metropolitan Police. The latter&gt;however, is in a unique situation,  in terms of its relations with theHome Secretary, and through him to Parliament. Where services in l&gt; ^  Ba;were funded directly by the exchequer, there would be an inconsiste&quot;with ratepayers in other parts of the country, who would still be ta*e 6,for the provision of, for example, public transport. To overcome this 0rthere would have to be equivalent offsetting reductions in rate supP ^grant for London. Ministers have decided that the MTA should not havpower to raise its own taxes, but that there should be some offsetti0^reduction in the total of block grant to reflect the fact that traflSp 7.in London will be exchequer funded.au-id beii. Joint Boards (eg Police, Passenger Transport Authorities). They wouj- ne(financially and legally distinct from the local authorities in the a tothey cover. There would be a sufficient degree of electoral &lt;UiI CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL* i;io s accountability. On that basis it is recommended that they should be ableto raise their own taxes. The basis on which they should do so isdiscussed further in paragraphs 6-11.theThere are at present a number of Joint Police Authorities. Formally theseare joint boards and have a separate legal existence. In terms of theirvj responsibilities they are comparable to the joint boards proposed forpolice services in metropolitan areas. They do not however raise taxesdirectly since they are formed from existing precepting bodies. Insteadtheir expenditure is shared between the constituent authorities whoprecept separately for their own share. These joint police authoritiesprovide an alternative model for financing the expenditure of joint0dy boards. This model might be the appropriate one if joint boards were note. to receive block grant payments directly (see paragraphs 15-17 below).j_y iii. Joint Committees:  (eg civil defence). These committees would not beresponsible for the executive provision of services. Responsibility wouldremain vested in the constituent authorities. The joint committees would3dieS have no separate legal identity. They could not, therefore, be given)n powers of taxation. The Committees could however make arrangements forone or more of their consituent bodies to provide services on behalf ofall of them. They would therefore need to agree on cost sharingarrangements. Shared costs would then be the responsibility of theie constituent authorities which would have to raise the finance for these.icy aSls of Taxations The bodies, empowered to raise local tax can in principle do so either directly r bvoft Precepting on the authorities in whose areas they operate.  It would bee the &quot;^istratively simpler for them to precept rather than raise their own local taxng xy as only one system for tax collection would be necessary.There are two ways of basing a precept. The first would be a uniform precepton tue local authorities involved. This is the usual form of precept. It means thatd he ntles contribute in proportion to their rateable value, although notte^s Sa-riiy in proportion to the benefit they receive. The second approach would be0 refiAect the benefits being received in each local authority by means of a&apos;iff arential precept. This would vary the precept between different parts of theCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL ^County area according to perceived differences in levels of service provided. 0 e t^service to which this might apply is public transport. A major difficulty with thapproach would be in deciding how far the apparently higher levels of expenditureone part of an area merely reflected differences in need. The rate support grant ^arrangements are intended to result in ratepayers in different authorities payingthe same rate pounda-ge for equivalent standards of service, ie for equivalent ^amounts of expenditure in relation to assessed needs. A differential precept wouldfleetedbe justified only where the additional expenditure to one part of the area reiJ- ga higher standard of service than to another. Any differentiation in the precept ^ought to reflect also the variation in standard of service. In practice, this woU Q^be technically difficult to achieve.   . on^.1 Part8. Alternatively, it would be possible for the bodies empowered to raise a *? rtax not to do so, but to allocate their costs between those authorities in whoseareas they operate. There are precedents for this approach in the arrangements ^sharing costs in the existing joint police authorities. These bodies are empoweby the 1964 Police Act, under which they are constituted, to come to whatever gfinancing arrangements they consider most suitable. Costs are shared in variousin different authorities - on the basis of rate products, on population, and on ^. t thepopulation and part the distribution of police manpower. It is recommended tna riearrangements for existing combined police authorities should not be disturbed. gta^9. On financial grounds,  it is recommended that as a general principle thoS pte^f hebodies empowered to raise local taxes do so by means of a uniform precept on acCQlauthorities in whose areas they operate. This follows the established precedent 0 t^the GLC and County precepts on London Boroughs, Metropolitan and non-Metropolita  Part;jDistricts. It is administratively straightforward. And it is generally consistetl 6(^^1 A   f 3^with the principles of rate poundage equalisation. The upper tier bodies wouX&quot; &lt;^8^tax on the tax base of constituent authorities, whatever the particular type  ^ aPpiitax. The administrative question of who actually collected any new tax is anwhich can be considered separately at a later stage. U,? , ht  10. If future arrangements provide for a local tax other than rates, it niig , estai.he yienecessary to express the precept in cash terms to avoid the uncertainty of tne Scherjof the tax. The cash amount, however, would be determined by estimates of the C-Ussrelative size of the tax base or bases. ^ot jCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL^ U-^In the case of bodies without the power to raise taxes,  it would be left to)nechis        the constituent athorities to raise the funds. The grant system would compensate forin      atly differences between the expenditure needs and resources of these authorities.irelt Prayment of Specific and Supplementary Grantsuld        l2     Where a successor body had independent financial responsibility for a serviceected was raising its own tax, it should also receive directly any specific orSuPPlementary grant entitlements. Joint boards would fall into this category. As foroUld       j int committees, since they would have no independent financial structure of their Wtl. it would not be possible to pay specific or supplementary grants to them, but0tlly to their constituent authorities. The closest analogy is probably inner cityocal       Partnership Committees, where urban programme grant is paid to member authoritiestath-er than to the Committees themselves. There are, however, few specific andtQt        Elementary grants which come into this category probably affecting only civild_fred ience and the urban programme.w3ys      ^i&apos;lements to Block Grantthe *    Districts and boroughs should receive grant directly in respect of functionsdev ived to them. It would not be legally possible for joint committees to receive tatlt. In respect of joint boards, there are two possible approaches. Direct payment f block grant to joint boards would allow these bodies, like other upper tier, Opting bodies,  to levy a precept net of grant income. This would enhance\i        aCc untability by putting- the local rate poundage contribution for that service onitl the same basis as for similar joint boards in other metropolitan areas. Moreit ParticulariV) it would ensure that comparable increases in expenditure led to.aiSe     bivalent increases in rate precepts as for other local services and that the^incentives to high levels of expenditure built into the grant arrangements,ue        appUed equally to all local government spending.U&quot;    However, it must be recognised that direct payment of block grant would^ire technical changes to the grant distribution arrangements. First the,ieli     eStabUshment of single-service authorities might require the block grant poundageSChe&lt;1ule to be split on a service-by-service basis, instead of the present split byClaSs of authority. This would alter the balance of grant between all authorities,^ ^st in the metropolitan areas and in London. The main effect would be a grantSHift from the Shire Districts to the Shire Counties equivalent to about a 3p rate.CONFIDENTIALI
CONFIDENTIAL15.     Secondly, payment of grant to new single service authorities would expose the aushortcomings of the GRE assessments for individual services. At present it is *n Slauthority&apos;s total GRE which is compared with its total expenditure for grant thpurposes. Single service authorities would not be able to offset high spending  none service with lower spending on another. This would focus attention on theexpenditure performance of an authority in relation to the GRE for a particular *service. GRE&apos;s have never been intended for this purpose and are not robust enoughat service level, except for ILEA which has always had an explicit expenditure/^ SPcomparison for education. For example, the Merseyside police expenditure, net   18police grant, is 13% above the Merseyside Police GRE. This would create grave-problems for a Merseyside police board in coping with the effects of block grantmechanisms, and bring potential conflict with the Government&apos;s policy for growth inthe police service. Similarly, expenditure on fire services in West Yorkshire, f rexample, is currently running at 23% above its GRE. For these reasons the HomeOffice favour arrangements for paying grant to the rating authorities in respect  f19the expenditure of police and fire joint boards.mo;16.     Other members of the Group, however, note that this approach would requireboth GRE and expenditure to be attributed on some basis to constituent authoritieS&apos;This would distort the pattern of expenditure in relation to GRE for those bodie320and hence their grant entitlement. In particular authorities could lose grantthrough the operation of the block grant taper in respect of expenditure over which 0butthey had no direct control. This would weaken their accountability for their owntoexpenditure. Although these objections apply in principle to the existing jointpolice authority arrangements, their extension to the metropolitan areas would ?ach 1&apos;involve a much larger number of major spending authorities. An alternative appr  ,to paying grant to the lower tier authorities would be to make a separate grantcalculation for the joint board on the basis of its own GRE and expenditure but Pa5?thethe grant to the lower tier bodies by reference to their rateable values. Thisapproach was used in 1981/82 to pay the grant of both the GLC and the MetropolisPolice in London. It would not meet the objections of the Home Office, was anyw^fto$extremely unpopular with the London Boroughs, and has been abandoned completelylot1983/84.s c0,17.     Whichever approach were adopted, in order to avoid unacceptable grant l sS6 c0;for the new boards, GRE&apos;s would be likely to be increased so as to be closer toateexpected expenditure levels. That would mean increasing the GRE&apos;s for all ti*Oiauthorities carrying out the services which were to be run by single-service ^CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL\ the        au^orlties in the metr0politan areas. The separate identification of GRE&apos;s for H^ngle service authorities should of itself exert pressure to conform with them. Butthe need for &quot;realistic&quot; GRE&apos;s for these services would seem likely nevertheless to eaken overall expenditure control (unless of course GRE&apos;s for other services were^ be reduCed correspondingly). In aggregate,  local government expenditure would be Hr likely to increase.0ugh/GRE Special Implications for London Grant ArrangementsofThe present block grant arrangements discount 25% of London&apos;s rateable value WMblowing Londoners&apos; otherwise extremely high rate bills to be correspondinglych   There are also separate arrangements for sharing the benefit of the very highfor rateable va]_ues in central London with other inner London Boroughs,  called the HLondon Rates Equalisation arrangements.19      The abolition of the GLC would have implications for both. It might become^ difficult to confine the London discount arrangements to the present GLC area,^horltles adjacent to it-with equally high rateable values are already pressing Mies-        f r a part of their rateable value to be discounted.2 .     The existing London Rates Equalisation arrangements operate under the London ?*i*        Governraent Act 1963. As presently operated the City and Westminster make a contri-bution to a central pool which is distributed to other inner boroughs in proportiont0 rateable value. The total size of  the pool in 1983/84 is  66.792m. Heach 21.      In addition Co the London Rates Equalisation Scheme,   the precepts of  the GLC HUtld the ILEA) make covert transfers of funds from the wealthy central boroughs topay         ther authorities in London. Each lp of GLC precept raises  19.4m in total, of whichthe City contributes  2.5m ( 329/head) and Greenwich contributes  322,000tan (U&apos;50/head).ayfr *       22&apos;     For those services where successor bodies continued to precept on an allLot* n basis this covert transfer would continue. Where, however, services weretra*sferred to the boroughs (or bodies precepting on a part of London only) thisCOV*rt transfer would need to be replaced by some overt mechanism. Otherwise theC St to ratepayers in the City and Westminster of providing services would bedra**tically reduced.

There are two possible mechanisms for providing the extra resources needed WLondon Boroughs for the provision of these services. First, the existing LondonRates Equalisation Scheme could be extended. The Scheme would need to redistrib teup to  500m of grant through the central pool. Second, negative block grant could * a?PIntroduced. In other words.,  this would amount to a tax on the City and Westminster&apos;and any other London authority out of grant. It would differ structurally from &amp;extended rates equalisation scheme in that the negative grant would be collectedfrom the City and Westminster and added to the national block grant pool for onW*rddistribution to other authorities. The introduction of negative block grant wouldraise a number of complex issues. It would require legislation which might well becontroversial, since it effectively amounts to a power of taxation on the Borough3 ^affected. There would be exceptional problems for the City because of its extreme1?high rateable values and very low population. On the other hand, a London RatesPutEqualisation Scheme could involve the transfer of some  500m a year from the -itfand Westminster. They would be likely to generate considerable political pressureavoid participating in the Scheme, even though they would be no worse off than ^a ^ ^the existing arrangements. A final decision on whether the London Rates Equalis3^      g *&apos;Scheme or negative block grant should be adopted should best be taken after , P&lt;consultation with the authorities affected.The Metropolitan Transport Authority (MTA)25.     The introduction of a wholly exchequer funded MTA would produce a gain toLondon ratepayers since they would no longer be required to contribute towards -hecost of revenue support for bus services. To prevent London ratepayers gaining *nCONFIDENTIAL

In 1982/83, Londonratepayers contributed about t60m towards the cost of London bus services throughthe GLC precept. However, this is unlikely to be the appropriate measure of theAuction necessary in London&apos;s block grant. This would have to be assessed in thejod to       Hght of the revenue support being provided by the MTA to bus services.26&apos;     It would be possible to make any offsetting grant reduction to London byCueing the present 25% discount on London&apos;s rateable values for the purposes ofElating London&apos;s block grant. This would have the effect of reducing the blockgrant allocation of all the London Boroughs pro rata to their rateable value.H wever, this would not apply any of the offset to Westminster and the City. Theirrateable resources are so high that even after the rateable value discount they dold by        n t have any block grant entitlement. As they have a large proportion of London&apos;stQtal rateable value, the block grant reduction on all the remaining boroughs wouldute be about one third too great. It would therefore also be necessary to secure theld be      aPpropriate offset from these two authorities either through increased contributionst0 an extended London Rates Equalisation Scheme or by means of negative block grant, hatl as ^th functions transferred to the boroughs described above.dTward a*gets and Holdback .be 27&apos;     If a system of targets and holdback were to be retained after re-organisation,gbS SiDlilar problems would arise in setting targets for successor authorities as are*\1        bussed at paragraph 17 in setting their GRE&apos;s.

In the case of joint committees it mightbe desirable to make more formal arrangements than those which exist at present, atUast to designate one of the member authorities as the one which would be treatedas burring expenditure and receive allocations; the need for this would have to beMessed after consultation. Arrangements might be required for capital receipts nowliable as a resource for capital expenditure by the GLC and the MCCs to be Mliable to successor bodies instead (see paragraph 21).3&apos;       The first exception concerns the proposed MTA.

The GLC uniquely secures Parliamentary approval for the level of its capithe Xiexpenditure by an annual Money Bill, a procedure of some antiquity preserved by ^1980 Act but meshing ill with the capital control system in the Act.

Capital expenditure is an area where there would be potential, at least s^theory, for obstruction by outgoing authorities. The 1980 Act controls expenditurlevels, not levels of commitment. The Secretary of State has a specific power  ^ ^ ^direction to inhibit an authority&apos;from entering into new commitments, but it *s t,exercisable only once he is of the opinion that an authority is likely to over v ^in a given year. Overspending in the absence of a direction is not ultra vires&gt;its cneither can a direction prevent the fulfilment of contracts entered into before jissue. In law, therefore, an outgoing authority could commit successor bodies toheavy levels of expenditure in later years.in aUtb7. In practice, much of the private sector, and perhaps other organisationsthe public sector, might be reluctant to enter into major contracts with bodies ^whose days were numbered. This could not be guaranteed however and the same theconstraint would not apply to bodies which are established by the authorities a^themselves such as enterprise boards. In certain circumstances, wilful (trw,ld *ot 8overcommitment could lead to a surcharge on the members concerned, but it couj- 0^ ^be guaranteed that this would prove a sufficient sanction. SijCcthe8. There would appear to be no remedy for obstruction under existing Ha(jelegislation. If the reaction of the authorities concerned to any firm announce^ ^of an intention to abolish were sufficiently strong as to suggest that they w u exteresort to Imprudent behaviour, it would be possible to seek very quick legis-1-requiring those authorities to obtain Ministerial approval before entering int0contracts above a given size.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALReserves and Debt, ^      9       Local authorities may borrow, within limits set by Ministers, for capitalbasis      Purposes; they may also borrow for revenue purposes, but only in anticipation offflent       Avenues receivable within the then current financial year. Most authorities operatea consolidated loans fund (CLF) which pools borrowing from all sources and on-lendst0 service accounts at a common interest rate. In order to minimise the costs to theauthority, any day-to-day surpluses on revenue and other accounts are used by thetal        CLF in lieu of borrowing from the market and the PWLB (hereafter referred to asthe        &quot;eternal&quot; borrowing). Some authorities also maintain capital funds from which! Service accounts may borrow for some purposes instead of borrowing from the CLF.l0      In the 1974 reorganisation, internal debt to capital funds was extinguished by^celling the liability of the service account to repay the debt. This is aa ^&apos;keeping exercise which involves no real money transaction and simplifies;re Sequent arrangements. It would be appropriate to follow the same course again.^ sUrpiUSeS which had been lent internally (see previous paragraph) would have tobe Caused at or shortly after the date at which the reorganisation took effect soje0d       that the reserves could be distributed (paragraphs 20-23 below); such internallowing would therefore have to be replaced by external borrowing. The amounts areits       Uot Urge (revenue balances of the seven authorities currently total about t50m) but, for monetary policy reasons it would nevertheless be desirable to take suchlowing from the PWLB. Thus by the time reorganisation were complete, allfining borrowing by service accounts would be matched in aggregate for eachn autb-ority by an equal amount of external borrowing.U&apos;    There is no one-to-one relationship between particular external borrowings bythe C^F and lending to service accounts for particular capital projects. So,alth ugh capital assets of relevant services could be attributed to successor bodiesnot        (t Sether as far as is appropriate with responsibility for servicing associated debt n th-e assets), it would not be possible to distribute external debt betweenlessor bodies. Administration of the external debt would therefore have to remainthe responsibility of a single body, with those to whom the assets were transferred t ^ responsible for servicing the debt, ie for making sufficient payments to thed b0(ly Administering the debt to enable that body in turn to make due payments to0n er^al lenders.CONFIDENTIALQ I
CONFIDENTIAListResponsibility for servicing debtCO]12.     The basic principle adopted in 1974 was to distribute the responsibility ^otservicing debt to successor bodies with the assets to which the debt related, aIlC*that would seem to be the appropriate basic principle to follow again. In apply*0*&apos;ratthe principle, two points have to be borne in mind: first, the need to maintainmarket confidence by ensuring that the rate base is broad enough to service theplaced on it; second, the need to ensure that those paying for servicing debtassthrough the rates are those who benefit from the associated asset. In the,,  iy to ad\metropolitan counties, much of the debt relates to services which would be liKe.. nresenC  e&lt;be transferred to single area-wide precepting authorities:  these cases would p1age beno problems of confidence (the rate base will be unchanged)- or equity. In the cof the GLC, most of the debt is attributable to ILEA, where the principle ofdistribution with assets appears likely to hold once decisions are taken on t&quot;cfuture of the service; and to housing, where most of the responsibilities forservicing the debt have been or are due to be transferred to the boroughs anyway(subject to a covert subsidy through the GLC precept,  the future of which isofconsidered in Annex 4.3 on Current Finance and Grant).?ou CeS&gt; to13. Distribution arrangements for the debt attributable to the remaining servwhere the assets would be divided among a number of successors, could raise equ ,problems where an asset serves an area greater than that of the district or hotPteto which it would be transferred (such as highways, parks or the Crystal Palacesports centre); where otherwise similar assets being transferred to differentsuccessor bodies happen to carry very different amounts of debt; or where theof an asset - for sale or as a revenue generator - is small compared with theof debt attaching to it (as with derelict land or gipsy sites). The most impon-&quot; wh*cl1 Pa*of the services concerned, in terms of total debt outstanding, is highways, 011 tall three of the above considerations could arise. oiy t0 thr14. One possible approach for any service such as highways which looked like &apos; ^give rise to significant equity issues would be to transfer responsibility f r ^servicing debt not with specific assets but across all successor bodies pro rat3rateable value. This would not be perfectly equitable either, but might be an ^improvement. (On highways, some roads might be trunked; decisions yet to be take the handling of debt in such cases could affect the issue.) Other cases would j&quot;, of 3to be tackled on an individual basis; they might not be as significant as pan-package of transfers as they appear individually, but in particular cases they^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Group consider that all these issues canfor omy be decided in consultation. Attention would be needed to considerations ofand coufidence as well as those of equity; but solving the latter would tend also toSTing        solve the former by distributing responsibility for servicing debt more closely proB rat* to the revenue base which provides the means of servicing it.15      Decisions would also be needed on the distribution of responsibility for debtassociated not with fixed assets but with loans - particularly mortgage advances and,iy to      advances to industrialists - which it may not be possible to attribute by^ Seographicax area. There are no fundamental issues here and again consultation would H:ase be needed to sort out the details.i lustration of external debtty lh&gt;     The single body which (as described in paragraph 11 above) might take over the ?Ministration of external debt would need to be such as to inspire the confidence0f Anders - particularly -those who had already lent to the old authorities and thenf0u^ that the loan was being transferred - and to be able and willing in practiceice*&apos;       to Cope with.raanagement of debt on the scale involved. In 1974 the main successority ^thonty took over management of the debt of old authorities; but typically the new0ugh        authority had a larger rate-base, broader expertise and more staff than itsPredecessor, which would not be the case this time.a**        l?-     The Group propose that on this occasion two specific steps are desirable to H^       ^ure that confidence is maintained. First, wherever the CLF of the outgoingant a*thority might be brigaded for administrative convenience (see followingwni&lt;        ^graphs), it should retain a separate identity. The body holding the debt wouldtake over the rights and responsibilities of the outgoing authorities as to debt.Seco*d, the chain of responsibility from those charged with servicing the debt7 ^        thr u8h the administration body to the lender should be made absolutely clear. As inl974. the property transfer order would have to make those responsible for servicinga ^ legally liable to make the appropriate payments to the administration body, and^ ^ch payments a charge on their revenues. The administration body would in turn,n ^ to be liable to the original lenders and have a revenue base on which the loansC U1* be secured. Care would be needed in the presentation as well as the substance,f 3         f ^ese provisions. Such matters should be explored further in consultation.zo^ ICONFIDENTIAL , ,
CONFIDENTIALi18. From the practical viewpoint, transferring responsibility for administeringexternal debt should present few difficulties in the metropolitan areas. Any Ulthe larger districts presently administers far more external debt than does iLa, . n ty fot coicounty:  there would be no problem in principle about transferring responsibi-L1 1id &quot;oimanaging the debt to one of the districts, though the appropriate district couonly be determined in consultation.22.19. In London, it seems unlikely that any single borough would have the manp weor the expertise to administer the enormous external debt of the GLC (E2400m asta&quot; bai31.3.82). Managing debt on such a scale could require, say, five times as manymore Honas any borough would have to manage its own CLF. It may well, therefore, provesatisfactory to retain a separate body, at least until such time as the debtreduced, though this could not be finally decided before consultation.inextReserves20. A basis would also be required for distributing reserves. Revenue balang.-6Xtnot attributable to particular services. In 1974 they were distributed betweensuccessor bodies pro rata to rateable value. A modified approach would be needethe case of the GLC and MCCs, where the successor bodies would not necessarilyrices aftdiscrete rate bases. It would be reasonable first to divide them between servipro rata to a convenient measure of relative expenditure, and then, where neceto divide within services between successor bodies covering different geograpnareas pro rata to rateable value (subject to consideration of the effects orarrangements for equalisation of rateable values in London through RSG). The 1balances of ILEA are separate from those of the GLC and should be dealt withb0r.separately.21.     The balance of capital funds remaining after the extinguishing of intern ^debt (see para 10) would not be attributable to specific services either and wo11funds uns,fall to be distributed like revenue balances; this is appropriate in that thewill have been constituted from the general rate fund originally. Unspent capj&gt;^-^ a^receipts will normally be attributable to particular services and particulargeographical areas. But not all authorities necessarily maintain a register ofcapital receipts In such detail; and in any case it is a principle of the capsystem in the 1980 Act that capital receipts are available to any service. .LLprobably be appropriate to distribute unspent capital receipts in the same waysetsrevenue balances.

A sudden upsurge of borrowing on any scale could upset thesta^      baiance Qf the money market and would have unwelcome consequences for the PSBR and&quot;toney aggregates. For three reasons, we consider that this would not in practice be; a Problem. First, the revenue balances of the GLC and MCCs are tiny in comparisonWitb the external debt of local authorities. Second, in the short term any increasel  the external borrowing of those bodies would be matched exactly by a reduction inVernal borrowing by successor bodies on receipt of their share of the reserves.Thi&apos;d, in the longer term successor bodies would probably maintain larger revenue^      dances for the carrying out of their functions than do the GLC and MCCs, so that HVernal borrowing would be lower following reorganisation.W        23&quot;     It might be difficult to transfer reserves in their entirety for a long timeaft*r the date of transfer of functions.

The amounts of additional short-term borrowing involved - a few1      I    tens of millions, very largely offset by the borrowing which the outgoingduties would otherwise have undertaken - would probably not be large enough toand*       Settle the market, but any addition to bank borrowing would be unwelcome from aal ^tary standpoint and would involve additional interest charges.

For example, authorities refusing to cooperateby supplying information or entering into negotiations could seriously delaythe transfer of staff or property.(ii) Mischievous behaviour could have short - or long - term consequences. In Hthe short-term, authorities might mount propaganda campaigns or members couldresign en masse, with the aim of influencing the Government to change its mindon abolition.

Authorities might also take action with the long-term aim ofeffectively sabotaging the successor structure.

It seems unlikely that councils would opt for the most extreme forms of aCti &quot;outlined above. But these are, nevertheless, all theoretical possibilities. If theGovernment opts for some sort of expenditure control system, as currently beingconsidered by E(LF), this could increase the sense of confrontation over abolition&apos;although it should also decrease the possibility of mischievous expenditure havinSsignificant effects, certainly in the immediate term. On the question of long&apos;te^constraints, the existing capital expenditure controls can restrict an authority&apos;5expenditure, but not usually its levels of commitments, although it could transpirethat would-be contractors -will be reluctant to enter into major contracts withbodies whose days are numbered (see Annex 4.4).Timing of obstruction5. Obstruction seems most likely to occur during the period between announcefl&gt;eI1^of abolition and Royal Assent to the necessary legislation. This would be the Pefi when authorities would have most hope of changing the Government&apos;s intentions ai d gleast incentive to cooperate.

Politically-motivated obstruction by councillors seems likely.

CONFIDENTIALdies c nstraints.king 7       Certain .vising constraints might well discourage some potential^ruction. These include the issue of public reports or possibly even surcharge^tion by the authority&apos;s external auditor, in cases of profligate or unlawfulexpenditure. Also, third parties might take legal action in similar cases allegingb^ach of fiduciary duty. Both of these possibilities might deter obstructive*&lt;*ions, but if actually invoked they would each take some time to have any effect,**. in any case they might not deter really committed opponents prepared to takeaCtio       e*treme measures. Further use of an existing constraint would be the threat bythe listers to invoke powers to review local authority decisions, where these exist.[ion,         .      The Government could also consider threatening add^O^c^^^ to deter ?vitig  bstruction. These could include:ty&apos;  - withdrawing existing local authority powers, eg Section 137 of the Local9pif Government Act 1972 which allows authorities to spend the product of a 2p rate MMM&quot;in the interests of- their area&quot;.~ selective ministerial intervention, eg on aggregate spending or individual ?appointments or contracts.- direct rule,  ie dismissal of existing councillors and_replacement by H-i&amp;t^ ^ Commissioners.^       9&quot;      Selective methods would work, at some cost in central government effort; but ?an authority determined to cause disruption could continue to find new points ofChaUenge until intervention would have to become virtually general and complete. Ifthe threat of counter measures did not act as a sufficient deterrent the cost ofMeeting obstructive actions could be significant; compensation might have to bedgnt        PaK for example, if action were taken to retrospectively modify particularttot        tracts. The possibility should also be borne in mind that merely suggesting the(ility       P ssible use of these constraints could in itself encourage escalation of bstruction. Ministers would clearly have to strike a balance between the prudentefS P1anning 0f counter measures and the possibility of provoking action.CONFIDENTIAL o i
CONFIDENTIAL?1985 GLC/MCC Elections10. The next elections Co the GLC and MCCs will be in May 1985, when theGovernment&apos;s preparations for abolition might be well advanced, but before abOJ-had actually taken effect. Abolition would therefore be bound to be the main iss ein the elections. Most groups on the GLC and the MCCs would be likely to opp se ^abolition, so victory for any party could be claimed as giving the council conc-rtla mandate to resist Government attempts to abolish it.11. One solution to this potentially embarrassing situation would be to cg S ~*^1985 elections. This would require primary legislation, which would also have c0extend the terms of office of councillors elected in 1981. Cancellation has sevattractions:i- it is well precedented. Both the London Government Act 1963 and the Localto b8 1Government Act 1972 cancelled elections to local authorities which wereabolished.- it would save  9m at 1981-2 prices (the cost of running the elections)*]- it could be justified on the grounds that newly elected councillors wouldserve only a token 12 months or so before abolition took effect.112.     Cancellation would, however, have certain disadvantages:1__i- it would be seen as an attempt to stifle opposition to abolition.ai- it would still be possible for obstructive councillors to force by-e_eby resigning. This could be met either by legislating that any vacancy s caused should be left unfilled, or - since this could lead to councilsunrepresentive or too small to function effectively - to allow councils t0fill casual vacancies by co-option. The latter would, however, becontroversial for such large authorities; at present, only parish andcommunity councils have the power to co-opt their own members.CONFIDENTIAL---^^^
CONFIDENTIAL^     - the main abolition legislation may not receive Royal Assent sufficiently in |Hadvance of the May 1985 elections to enable their cancellation before most Mpreparatory expenditure had been incurred. To avoid this, cancellation coulditiOf instead be made the subject of a separate, small bill; but this might well be ?seen as improperly anticipating the results of Parliament&apos;s scrutiny of the hmain bill.err*&quot;113.     An alternative to cancellation would be to defer the 1985 elections for a set ?Period of  time.  This might be justified on the grounds  that elections would beL_jj  Pointless given the uncertainty over the authorities&apos;  futures. This would alsoT require primary legislation, probably a small bill in advance of the main one;jtal however,  this ought to be less controversial than a separate bill proposingcancellation, as considered above. Deferral might be less controversial thanbright cancellation, although it might still be criticised. An initial deferralil of&gt; say, 1 year might be the best option, followed if necessary by a further) * deferral, or by cancellation if abolition was by then imminent.inclusions14 .     It seems likely that some form of obstruction would be encountered.d            Authorities would either refuse to cooperate in the exercise, or take active stepst0 disrupt it, or both. But it is very difficult to predict with any certainty theUkelihood of particular types or degrees of obstruction occurring.15 . There is a difficult question of balance involved in deciding on what counter ?measures to take in order to prevent obstruction. Taking early action with this aim ?^Sht successfully influence authorities not to obstruct the changes; on the otheri n5 hand, early action might simply inspire authorities to devise means of getting roundthe counter measures and successfully obstructing abolition.I&quot; jCONFIDENTIAL ^--i^^^^
