Puo^rTmsector pensions will also continue to beprotected on^he-b^asis of realistic contributions.&quot;This makes explicitxt^w^Government view expressed in more guarded termsin the debate on the &lt; c^r&gt;Report on 22 October 1982.   We are nowcommitted to maintainii4^ u^ex linked pensions but only on the basis ofrealistic employee contMD^Jpans.2. We have already made ams olerable progress.    The main fast accrualschemes, armed forces, police^^n^firemen, have had their contributionsraised to about 11 per cent. ^TO^tjouse of Commons has voted a con-tribution rate of 9 per cent fofc/J&amp;p Parliamentary scheme.   We must nowconsider how to apply the policy t/cKrae other groups, particularly thoseon normal accrual schemes, Civil Se&apos;ryCBk, teachers, National HealthService, local government, and emplvy&apos;ee^of numerous fringe bodies.There are other groups, such as judga^^rison officers and mentalhealth officers, to whom special consrdW^ti^ms apply.3. I seek the agreement of colleagues boat:a. the financing arrangements of public service schemes shouldbe reformed to bring out more clearly the tot^L costs of thebenefits provided and how they are split be/ we^i employer andemployee.    (Making the Principal Civil ServiE^S^vision Schemecontributory, on which I have put forward detjailpa^proposalsseparately in correspondence, is an essential^e^^atit here);b. all public service pension schemes should beC^vl^wed, inassociation with the Treasury, to settle and intro^cV^propriaterealistic contribution rates;c. we should start from 8 per cent (the current amoumrxfewHedpaid by civil servants) as the &quot;realistic&quot; contributionfor normal accrual schemes.? 1 confidential! %
(r\ lCONFIDENTIAL.1 HB I&apos;     The attached note sets out the main considerations in greater^detail.^x&gt;     5.     I fully appreciate the difficulties which colleagues will face in X/^*?egotiating and introducing higher contribution rates.   However, therew^Wll never be a better time.   Those concerned have been fairly warned^^-^YNthe Manifesto, and we can exploit the momentum created by the earlierv^a^ges, including the recent change in the Parliamentary scheme. Wev&gt;aX^sWgest that if the employees are unwilling to pay realistic con-tr^i^ons, then we would consider as an alternative reducing the level f ^fen^A^ts, including index linking.   This is, of course, unlikely to Ibe at  ap/pive to them, but it could strengthen our tactical position.While 4^&gt;s-yiot essential that all the increases in contributions shouldbe impl&apos;eo^Ated simultaneously, I think we must reach a decision now onthe acticra/^e propose to take in relation to each group.   I believe itwould be a\mistake to postpone increasing the contribution levels untilall the other problems had been resolved.6. My proposals/r fer only to the public service pension schemes overwhich the Governm^nt))ias direct control.    Since 1971 the terms ofnationalised indu 32a^^ xhernes, including employee contributions, havenot been controlled^(bv/ohe Government.   Therefore we shall shortly needto consider how to na^lfie nationalised industries follow the publicservices&apos; lead.  . /^y\7. If colleagues agree wrthj^he proposals set out .&apos;in paragraph 3 above,I suggest that my official^^J^tyconjunction with other interestedDepartments, be asked to prasaj?4^a detailed programme of action, buildingon Appendix 2 of the note below^X^id to report back to Ministers withspecific proposals for moving j&amp;rwarfyd in each of the areas to be tackled.While individual Departments sho^lwVemain responsible for conductingnegotiations in their own areas, a^dregree of central involvement isclearly needed, if only to ensure consistency of approach, and theTreasury seems best placed to provide^Kfs.   I suggest that whenParliament returns we should announce &lt;g^^zntention to proceed in theway proposed,  in accordance with the Mai^yp^o.N L _\ ITreasury Chambers9 September 1983?

A3STNSZ - &apos;&apos;.j*!^.COKglDZNTIAL^Hklic_Service Pensions??his note, sets out some of the main considerations in greater detail.financing:he subject has been vitiated by lack of published information and by Bjthe complexity of the financing arrangements.   Although the Scott and***** reports&quot; and the publication of a long Parliamentary Answer on19 October 1982 helped&apos; to combat some of the misapprehensions, the^sent arrangements are still unnecessarily complex and in some casesPiously misleading.   The Civil Service was previously deemed to have*ade ^ &quot;effective contribution&quot; to the cost of pensions through thepa? ^search arrangements, but since 1980 it has been impossible to^asure precisely what that contribution is.   In the case of theClonal Health Service (NHS) and teachers&apos; schemes, the costs of*aeiona inc-ease have been financed directly by the Exchequer, soa d. stQrted viflW Qf what the employer and employee contributionst0       notional funds are paying for.   Furthermore the notional fundsJ*5 deemed to be invested exclusively in gilts, so raising suspicions j^ the actuarial measurement of the costs is unfair.2     T*e following principles ought to be applied to all schemes&quot; |Ha    the full costs of the benefits provided, includingpensions increase, should be measured regularly;b     the schemes should be measured in the same -.-ay as theyWould be if the contributions were invested in real funds s in the private sector with the costs of pensions increase Mincluded;c    the way in which the costs are split between employerand employee should also be made clear..      In the case of the Civil Service this means moving to a con-;rlb^ory 8che^ as recommended by Kegaw.    In the case of the teachers^ llHs it means altering the basis of the present notional funds so.     tfcey are deemed to be invested in the whole range of investment^  vailabie to real funds.    In the case of local&apos;government schemes, ?are funded but where the funds do not provide for the payment of&quot;-Sl ns increase, it probably reauires the full funding of allAtt, 147 I

Treasury proposals on&apos;.,.*H*yters have been put to the departments concerned.^    Tb &apos;a&quot;.

Unfortunately the schemes have been valued at different II^ a &apos; llI1^er different conventions, and they cannot be exactly comparedk,pK    C&apos;i-L    However, as can be seen, the most important difference is.&apos;&quot;&apos;5aid .             ^er cen^ P3^-^ ^y        Civil Service and the 6 per cent^     j &quot;teachers, EES, and local government for similar benefits..
