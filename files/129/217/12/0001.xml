Today, we are on coursefor the target of 630,000 by 1 April 1984, a reduction of over 100,000. since the Government came into office in 1979.2.      It would nit Kumy view be realistic to aim for another reduction f that magnituden^Viypev cent)  in our second term of office, but Ido  believe   we sho^l-dy&gt;naintain a firm downward pressure.    It will be asmall but useful co^^lbu^ion to achieving the public expenditure levelswhich I propose in my/J^^^ate paper C(83) 23.3-     Last December, Cabinet/agreed that further target figures shouldbe set for April 1988.    fra/ o\al was to be built up from individualfigures agreed for each Depi^r4^nt, not the other way round as in 1980,so that the numbers matched rfuyrvNklosely the needs of the work. Therewas to be some flexibility so\tb^ODepartments were not committed totargets which depended on policy/j^^vsions whose timing or evenacceptability could not be guara^ realistic allowance was also tobe made for contingencies.    I do tt^c prapose any variation from thoseconclusions. &lt;V^L-\4&lt;     As Cabinet also agreed, my predec^A&amp;^-r asked all Departments fora statement of their likely manpower neWs from 1984 to 1988 and of thescope for further reductions. ^5.     Because of the General Election, there has riot yet been anyMinisterial discussion of the results.    But the/1Ti ures which colleaguesreported amount to the prospect of a total of TOguad^lOjOO by 1 April1988 on the basis of present policies.    This wou]/a&apos;&apos;b^j improved to justunder 605,000 after new initiatives which they hop53V^&amp;) set in hand.Colleagues were also asked to say what they would d^iLA&gt;t werenecessary to reduce these figures further by 5 per cd^^\l0 per cent. 1The possible options identified under this heading cariveXp^ome 35,000. HHSome of the options look impracticable; others would reqwfee^difficuit ,Policy decisions.    About 5,000 posts might be saved by coT^ara/jting fljllwork out.    Further work is needed to establish what can be^^^^^^^ j[confidential! ^% I
(f% [confidential! HI &gt;     The 605,000 figure includes one large hiving-off:  the Royal hHH[/&gt;          Ordnance Factories with some 18,000 staff.    If that is put to one side, Bflthe net reduction which colleagues propose is small.    This is because HLH^vj&gt;%     some quite sizeable reductions (eg 4,000 from the computerisation of flJSSSfi///\ ^ay ^s You Earn in the Inland Revenue) are offset by proposals for jfwWx\ J) ^ncreases (eg 6,500 for the Prison Service and 2,000 from the Department ifigSV_v/Qf Health and Social Security for their social security offices).&lt;$S^ ... IIn order to prepare firm proposals for collective decision, I^/^J^Lneed the help of my colleagues to: Ural^/a^x   assess the scope for greater savings from improved Pufflffliency and productivity.    I doubt whether all colleagues &quot;,, **&apos;iS^S/set themselves sufficiently stiff hurdles here;b. &lt;^reduce any proposed additions to the essential minimum; S^Hc. establish the extent to which additional options,especially for contracting work out, can be decided upon atthis stagevC^y)Sy these means I t&amp;rnys it should be possible to reduce the overall targetfigure below 600, sJOOj^xtrSugh I cannot yet say how much further it will bepracticable to go. &lt;y18- I propose to purs&lt; e^n^se questions with colleagues at the sametime as the main Expenditu^/Survey.    The timing is convenient and itwill be useful to conside^^th^r expenditure and manpower together.  ,11119- I invite Cabinet: &lt;^\\) IwaEa. to agree that the genre rM^aim should be rather largerreductions than those so f asc^of e r , but consistently withthe conclusions reached last &lt;J&gt;e^cejnper; fl^|b. to note that I will seek a| s6jz^(ent to such reductionsin the bilateral discussions on t^e/^urvey and report backto Cabinet in the autumn. \\treasury Chambers &lt;^V?
