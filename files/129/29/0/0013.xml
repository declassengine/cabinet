(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E C R E T -sCOPY NO.CP. (U8)  20315th August, 19U-8.CABINETLEVEL OF GERMAN industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsSummaryI have been considering the outstanding questions relating to the level of German industry.      The two mostimportant are the form and scope of restrictions to be appliedto those industries prohibited under the March 19h7 Level&quot;ofIndustry Plan,  and the duration of the restrictions on german industry which have &quot;been agreed or may now be proposed.      Thequestion of prohibited industries was briefly discussed at therecent Six-Power&apos; Talks on Germany,  and remitted to a tripartiteworking party in Berlin for consideration and report by 1stSeptember.      The duration of restrictions has never been treated in previous plans for the level of industry since it wasconsidered to be a question which should be decided in the context of a German Peace Treaty in the light of circumstancesruling at the time of its preparation.     Since that Treaty isnot yet in sight,  and it is essential that the German authoritiesbe given guidance as to the scope of their authority to planchanges in the structure of German industry, we must seek apractical solution of this question in concert with the UnitedStates and if possible the French Governments.      The UnitedStates Military Governor is pressing for a decision that apartfrom the prohibited industries no restrictions as opposed toprohibitions should be maintained on the level of Germanindustrial capacity or production except for that applied tosteel.      I believe the French Government to be strongly in favour-of maintaining indefinitely a wide range of restrictions.2. I think that in the absence of four-Power agreement onthe whole German question it would be impossible to maintain aswide a range of restrictions as&quot;the French may desire.      Iconsider that the greater part which it is now seen Germany must play in European recovery should dictate a more liberal policyof restriction than we formerly thought to be necessary.Moreover,  the present political situation in Germany,  coupled with the recent deterioration in international relations,  obligeus to offer the German people under our control the maximum hopeof a sound economic future.      The Chiefs of Staff have advised that no continuing restriction on the production of industriesneeded for war but also essential to the German economy endEuropean recovery need be regarded as essential on security grounds.      I believe,  therefore, that we should modify the policy on prohibited industries approved by Ministers in July 1 9h7 Hto the extent of permitting a greater measure of production incertain of them.      I think that we should also provide for onlya small number of continuing restrictions, the enforcement of which H O.R.G. (i+7) 32  (Approved at O.R.C. (h-7) 6th Meeting)
might be both within our power and acceptable to British andother public opinion.Recommendation3. I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that theproposals with regard to the German level of industry setout in Annex &apos;A&apos; to this memorandum should form theinstructions to the Military Governor in the forthcomingbipartite and tripartite talks in Berlin.Historyh* The Potsdam Agreement provided in general terms forthe industrial disarmament of Germany by two kinds of limitation:the prohibition of certain industries and the restriction of others.      In August 1 9h5 ray colleagues approved therecommendations made in a report by the Economic and IndustrialPlanning Staff on the Industrial Disarmament of Germany.s     Tbepolicy which was then approved provided guidance for thenegotiations in Berlin which led to the quadripartite plan for reparations and the Level.of Post-war German Economy completed in March 191+6.      This plan provided for the elimination ofGerman war potential by the drastic removal of industrial capacity much of which was, in our view, necessary to maintain a reasonable standard of life in Germany.      The plan did notspecify the duration of the limitations on Germany which itimposed, because it was our view that the question of duration of limitations was one to be decided in the context of a German peace Treaty in the light of circumstances ruling at the timeof its preparation.      The failure of the Soviet to implementone of the key assumptions of the plan led to the plans falling into abeyance.5* In July 19h7 my colleagues accepted certain recommendations which I submitted to thorn yJ  and later approved a number of modifications which were incorporated in the Anglo-American Level of Industry Plan of August 19h7, on which theBritish reparations programme of October 19h7 was based.      this plan also did not specify the duration of the limitations on germany which it imposed, nor did it deal,  owing to Americanobjections, with the industries prohibited under the March 19h6PI an.6. It is desirable that we should settle now the outstanding questions relating to the level of German industry,base our final reparations programme on our conclusions,.and give the German authorities and European economic planners cleardirections with regard to the future -shape of German industry.The question of prohibited industries was discussed at the Six-Power Talks on Germany, when it was agreed that a tripartiteworking party should be established in Berlin to recommend whichindustries should remain prohibited and how much productivecapacity in the Western Zones should be retained in thoseformerly prohibited industries which should henceforth be-restricted only.      Both the United States and French governments are anxious to decide the question of duration of restrictions and the working party, which has not yet met,  is due to reportby 1st September.s O.R.0.(1+5)  26 (Approved at O.R.G.(h5) 5th Meeting)CP.

Argument ----7. Our industrial disarmament policy has &quot;been basedon the assumption that German industry contained a strongwar potential, and that it would be possible for Germany tobecome a danger to peace once more unless the industrialelement of her war potential were removed and controlled by allied authority.      Developments over the post three yearslead me to doubt whether, for a. considerable time, germany should be regarded as a possible danger to peace other than as a tool for some other Power. .    Even on that assumption,however,  it is still in our interest to restrict her war potential.8. Recognising that in the time which has passed since our industrial disarmament policy was laid down there have beenmany changes in the international situation, the advice of theChiefs of Staff was sought as to the importance which should still be attached to the security value of the policy ofmaintaining restrictions on German industry.      Their view isthat a complete veto on the manufacture of war material propershould be imposed but that the maintenance of restrictions onthe output of industries which, while needed for war, are essential to the German economy and European recovery, need notbe regarded as essential on security grounds.      Their advice isconditioned by the view that difficulty would be experienced in assessing the exact point at which production ceased to be anecessity of the German economy and became a security danger, andthat therefore the enforcement of the restrictions by armed force or economic sanctions would raise great difficulties.9. It is open to us to limit German war potential in two ways.      The first method, already enshrined in the Anglo-American Level of Industry Plan, is the removal of capacitysurplus to the 1936 industrial level from those industries whichplayed the major part in war.      The second is to impose a continuing limitation on German industry by prohibiting theincrease of industrial capacity .or the raising of productionabove an authorised level.      The former is within our powerto achieve by removing surplus equipment as reparations duringthe period of occupation;    the second might involve enforcement of limitations after the withdrawal of the Occupying troops from some part, if not the whole,  of German territory.10. We must recognise that little purpose would be served by seeking to impose long-term limitations on German industry which we and our Allies might not have the power or the will .to enforce at the first sign of infringement.      enforcement of an agreed allied policy by the four Powers would be relatively simple.      Enforcement by the three Western powers in concert of a precariously agreed tripartite policy in theteeth of possible Soviet opposition would be more difficult.Recognising,  therefore, both the difficulties in the way of four-Power agreement and the slightly differing aims of theWestern Allies, I consider that we should confine prohibitionsto those industries with a high war potential which have littlepeace-time commercial significance,  and should limit theIndustries we propose to restrict to the smallest possible number consistent with security.11. In considering how these principles can best bo applied in practice,  account must be taken of the following considerations:-(a)    Western Germany must be provided with.the means to achieve a balance of payments at a reasonable standardof living compatible with the Potsdam definition.
(b) The fusion of the Bizonal Area with the French Zone,which is politically desirable, is likely toincrease rather than decrease the problem of achieving this standard,  particularly in view ofthe recent detachment of the Soar from the french zone.(c) We must have regard to the important part assigned to western Germany in the European Recovery Programme.(d) The position of Germany in relation to the East-Weststruggle, and the forthcoming establishment of a western German Government, both make it ne c e s s a ryto offer some assurance of a hopeful economicfuture to the German people in the Western Zones.(e) Since the most effective form of restriction is theremoval of surplus plant as reparations (seeparagraph 9 above) we must also have regard to the limitations on this procedure;      The existingreparations programme is meeting with increasingGerman resistance;    we could not hope to enforce a further programme upon them except within well-defined limits.(f) We should therefore remove the fear of permanentrestriction from those sections of German industry which it no longer seems desirable or, in the longrun,  practicable to restrict,  should authoriseproduction on a restricted scale where advisablein those hitherto prohibited industries thecontinued prohibition of which is not essential toour security,  and settle in a realistic mannerconsequential reparations problems.12. We must also have regard to the attitude of ourWestern Allies towards this problem;    and must frame a policywhich offers some prospect.of enabling early agreement withthem to be reached.(1)    The United States authorities are wedded to the viewthat the Level of Industry Plan should be regardedprimarily as a reparations exercise and that noindustry,  other than certain prohibited industries to be defined and steel,  should be restricted forany period.of time.      Largely,  I believe,  owing totheir great financial responsibility for theadministration of Germany,  they attach greater importance to the possible part Germany might play in European reconstruction - and are less concernedwith security than the members of the organisation for European Economic Co-operation.      The UnitedStates Military Governor is also pressing for. adecision on the question of the duration for whichvarious restrictions should be applied.      Weunderstand it to he the American view that  prohibitionsshould be imposed for an indefinite period but besubject to revision,  and that apart from these theonly restriction on industrial capacity or annualproduction which might continue to be applied shouldbe that of the production of steel which was authorisedat 10.7 million tons in the Anglo-American Levelof Industry Plan.      To persuade them to modify thisview and accept certain other restrictions is likelyto prove difficult.-h-
.  (ii)    The French Government have always taken the viewthat the majority,, if not all, of the restrictionsof the Level of Industry.Plan should he treatedas indefinite limitations on German productivecapacity and production in the interests ofEuropean security.      They believe that Germanindustrial capacity is already more than sufficientto maintain a reasonable standard of living andpossesses a war potential of which France goes infear.      This is a question on which they feel most strongly and which&apos;is of great significance in .French internal politics.      The policy advocated by the United States Military Governor will therefore be most unwelcome to them.      However,  thepolitical repercussions in France of -surrenderingto the American view are such that the Americans-might be prepared to follow the middle course whichI now propose,  and this might be acceptable to theFrench.13* The proposals for the German level of Industry setout in Annex &apos;A1  have therefore been drawn up with the expertassistance of the British Element of the Control Commissionand interested departments to take account of the abovefactors.      I wish to draw my colleagues&apos;  particular attentionto one item included in and two omissions from the prohibitedand limited lists.      In paragraph 2A it is proposed that themanufacture of ball and roller bearings should be prohibited.This industry may be regarded as one of the main keys to german war potential.      However, its prohibition may involve an ultimate German import requirement of  9,500,000 and maybe opposed by the United States Administration on these grounds.To obtain American agreement we should be prepared to make concessions by deleting magnesium from the prohibited list and perhaps some of the limitations on non-ferrous metals, electricarc and high frequency furnace steel, and machine tools listed in paragraphs 3C and 3D of the Annex.      I think that we should give the Military Governor freedom to negotiate in this sense.The omissions to which I would refer are,&apos; first, sulphuricacid, nitric acid,  chlorine, calcium carbide and acetylene, and secondly,  the optics and precision instruments industry whichin the discussions on the official level the Ministry of Supplywished to see limited in certain respects.      In the light ofthe advice of the Chiefs of Staff I consider that these additional limitations could not be justified.      The UnitedStates Military Governor has already made it clear that he isnot prepared to accept the second.Recommendsti on1h. In my view the proposals at Annex &apos; A&apos;  represent the bases most consistent with our security interests on which west and the remotest chance of.getting Anglo-American agreement.I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that these proposals should form the instruction to the British Military Governor inthe forthcoming bipartite and tripartite talks in Berlin.E.
