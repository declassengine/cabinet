i Si to        ^6 r*,)this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s goyernmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1948The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.   It is issued for the personal use of ..........TOP SECRET Copy No.CP. (48) 23015th October, 1948CABINET31LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME: 1948-49 session memorandum by the Lord President of the council at their meeting on 4th March, 1948 (CM. (48) 18th Conclusions, Minute 3)the Cabinet considered a provisional Legislative Programme for the 1948-49Session drawn up by the Future Legislation Committee (CP. (48) 68). TheCabinet agreed that the drafting of the Bills included in this Programme should proceed, and invited the Future Legislation Committee to review from timeto time the progress made with their preparation, and also to arrange for thepreparation of an appropriate number of minor Bills.2. The Future Legislation Committee have since carried out four reviews of the provisional Programme in consultation with the Ministers concerned,and they now submit for consideration by the Cabinet concurrently with the draftof The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament (CP. (48) 231) the programme set out in Groups I-VI of the Annex to this memorandum.3. In drawing up the Programme the Committee have sought to avoidimposing too heavy a load of legislative work on Parliament and to leave anadequate margin of time for contingencies, and have allowed for the fact thatas the Session proceeds it is invariably necessary to pass a number of Bills theneed for which cannot be foreseen at the beginning of the Session. It is truethat the 1948-49 Session will be unusually long, but if, as I hope, we arrangefor an extended Whitsun Recess, the prospective legislation is likely to be as muchas Parliament can cope with.4. I wish to raise with my colleagues the question of Private Members&apos; Timeand the advisability of giving a number of days in the 1948-49 Session for theconsideration of Motions but not Bills. This can be done, however, only atthe expense of the Government^ Legislative Programme.5. The following table shows how the numbers of Bills included in Groups Ito IV of the proposed 1948-49 Programme compare with the correspondingnumbers of Bills passed in the 1945-46, 1946-47 and 1947-48 Sessions: 1945-46   1946-47   1947-48   1948-49Essential Bills         ... 21 10 15 7Major Bills    ...      ... .17 12 8 12Medium-sized Bills ... 14 9 16 17Minor Bills   ...... 28 22 22 226. The Committee would draw the special attention of the Cabinet to thefollowing points :-(a) Bills which may be required or which will be introduced if time permits. -There are some Bills the need for which is not yet certain (e.g., the
National Service Bill and the Motor Spirit (Regulation) (Amendment)Bill). There are also several Bills which it would be desirable to passbut which, in view of the considerations mentioned in paragraph above, cannot at the present stage be given a definite place in theProgramme. All these Bills have been included in Group VI of the annex.(&amp;) Motorways Bill. The Committee felt some doubt whether on grounds ofpolicy the inclusion of a Motorways Bill in the Programme would bejustified, and agreed that the Cabinet should be asked to decide thisquestion. The Minister of Transport has urged that the Bill shouldbe retained and is circulating a separate memorandum to the Cabinetin support of his views.(c) The Cabinet are asked to note that it may be necessary to introduce aBill to amend the National Service Act, 1948. (This Bill is at presentincluded in Group VI.) Any such Bill is likely to be contentious andto make considerable demands on Parliamentary time.7.   The Committee invite the Cabinet (1) to approve Groups I to VI of the Annex to this memorandum as theLegislative Programme for the 1948-49 Session; and(2) to authorise the Legislation Committee to keep the Programme under constant review.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S. W. 1,15th October, 1948.
