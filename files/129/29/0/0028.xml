RICE SUPPLIES  - SOUTH EA&apos;3T ASIAMemorandum by South EaBt Asia Pood Committee1. .   RE C OMMBNDATIONSIt is recommended that:-(a) Ceylon he invj.-ted.to take up the flour equivalent of 32,000 tons of wheat, if necessary from dollar sources, and that her rice reouirements be reducedby 32,000 tons.(h) The Minister of Pood be invited to open negotiations at once for the purchase of the maximum possibleouantity of rice from Italy at the lowest possibleprice, provided this is in sterling.(c) Authority he given for up to 30,000 tons of riceto&apos; he purchased from Western Hemisphere sources,payment to be made in dollars if necessary.(d) The United Kingdom forego in favour of british territories in South Bast Asia&apos; the 22,000 tonsunshipped balance of its allocation, subject tothe approval of the International Emergency PoodCommittee.. - \(e) A decision be reached whether or not the 2k,000tons of rice now in the United Kingdom should,subject to the approval of the InternationalEmergency Pood Committee, be shipped to british territories in South East Asia.(f) The Government of India be invited to take 100,000tons of other cereals,  if necessary from dollar sources,  to meet their deficit of rice.2.      RICE EXPORTS FROM BURMAThe disturbances in Burma have seriously affectedexports of rice &quot;from that country.    Between 1st september and 31st December, 19h8, 400,000 tons of rice was dueto be shipped from Burma.    Our latest advice from HisMajesty&apos;s&quot;Ambassador, Rangoon, however, is that notmore than 80,000 tons of this is likely to be shippedIn this period.    The deficit will consequently he ofthe order of 320,000 tons.    This will represent a lossof some 47% of the total allocations from S.E. Asia,sources for this period.3.      RESULTANT REQUIREMENTSThe International Emergency Food Committee will not be considering allocations for 1949 until the end ofNovember 1948.    It is,  therefore, necessary for us toensure that territories of United Kingdom responsibilityhave adeauate stocks to maintain the ration issuesuntil the end of the calendar year 1948 and also toprovide a carryover until the 1949 allocations start tobe received.    The most careful analysis of the carryover/requi red...
required suggests that one month&apos;s reserve stocks are the absolute minimum essential to prevent dangerof a breakdown.      On this basis a table has beenprepared and is attached as an annex lire to thismemorandum showing the stock position and minimum requirements of each of the territories concerned(most of which are,  it should be noted,  substantialnett dollar earners).      The summary at the end ofthis table discloses that the minimum extra suppliesnow required for British territories,  excludingIndia, &quot;are 98,000 tons.In addition the requirements of India must beconsidered.      It is not possible to produce the sameaccurate statistics in respect of India as in respectof the other territories under discussion;    butIndia&apos;s deficiency will be 105,000 tons.h.      POSSIBLE METHODS OF BRIDGING THE GAP(a) Reduction of RationsOn political grounds it is considered highlyinadvisable to make further reductions in the overall ration scale in any of the territories concerned.      It is, however,  considered that therice ration of Ceylon could be reduced by about 20%,provided the cereals issue could be increasedaccordingly.(b) Cereals for CeylonOn the assumption made in sub-paragraph (a)  above that the rice ration of Ceylon could be reduced byabout 2Cfo provided the cereals issue was increasedcorrespondingly,  it is recommended that Ceylonshould be invited to take up the flour equivalent of 32,000 tons of wheat and that her requirementsof rice should be considered to be reduced by32,000 tons (i.e.  from 60,000 to 28,000 tons).In the absence of supplies from non-dollar sourcesthis flour could only be provided from dollar sources and it Vi/ould be for consideration what proportion of this dollar commitment should comefrom Ceylon&apos;s agreed expenditure of hard currency and what from United Kingdom reserves.      On theassumption that the dollar cost would be (in termsof vjheat)  23.  per ton,  the dollar expenditure involved would be 2.9 million dollars.(c) Italian RiceThe Ministry of Food have reason to think thatthere exists in Italy about 30,000 tons of ricewhich may be available for export and which couldbe purchased for sterling.      The InternationalEmergency Food Committee have already given Italyauthority to sell this rice wherever she pleases andhave undertaken that a formal allocation willsubsequently be made to cover such sales.      It is recommended that the Minister of Food be invited to/open-. . .
(d) Rice Obtainable as a -result of Revision of I.E.F.C,AllocationsThe Executive Committee of the InternationalEmergency Food Committee is meeting on Monday   13thSeptember, and Is likely of its own initiative to review the whole pattern of rice allocations.      Theresult of tills review is likely to be thatterritories of United Kingdom responsibility willbe offered additional rice from.Western Hemispheresources.      It is not possible at this stage to forecast what the quantities or the precise sourceswill be, but- it is recommended that authority begiven for- up to 30,000 tons of such rice to beaccepted.      The approximate cost of this rice is 60. per ton   and the consequent cost would be upto 7-2 million dollars.     In the unlikely event ofthe situation in Burma improving,   and of this riceor part of it consequently not being required-   everyeffort should of course be made to avoid taking upwhatever balance of Western Hemisphere rice was notrequired.(e) Allocations to the United KingdomAn allocation of h6,000 tons was made to the UnitedKingdom for the calendar year 19U8.      Of this52d,000 tons has already been purchased and shippedto the United Kingdom where it was on the point of distribution to the general public.      It is recommendedthat the united Kingdom should surrender its un-shippedbalance of 22,000 tons and that the InternationalEmergency Food Committee should be invited toreallocate this rice to British territories in SouthEast Asia.      In the preparation of the Annex it has. been assumed that this will be done.      It is also for decision whether the 2d,000 tons now in the UnitedKingdom should,  subject to the approval of theInternational Emergency Food Committee   be shippedback to British deficit territories in South .east asia.      In this connection,  it should be borne inmind that by the time it was shipped back to SouthEast Asia,  the price would be high,      (about  65-  aton) and that there might be political objections todepriving the public in the United Kingdom of the ricesupplies they had been allowed to expect.5-       THE REQUIREMENTS OF india the Government of India have recognised that they,may have - to accept 100,000 tons of cereals in place ofthe rice that they are losing by Burma&apos;s defection.But if these have to be from dollar sources,  this wouldinvolve a dollar expenditure of 9-2 million dollars.It would be for consideration what proportion of thisdollar commitment should come from India&apos;s   agreedexpenditure of hard currency and what from UnitedKingdom reserves.open negotiations at once for. the purchase of themaximum possible quantity of rice from Italy atthe lowest possible price, provided this is in sterling.
- h -6.      SUMMARY OF DOLLAR costs the maximum dollar costs will he:-32,000 tons of cereals for Cej-lon - 2.9 million dollars30,000 tons Western Hemisphere rice - 7.2 million dollars100,000 tons cereals for India - 9.2 million dollarsTotal:      19-3 million dollars7.      FUTURE OUTLOOKThis paper deals only with the position up to theend of 19U8.      It should   however, be noted thatavailabilities for export from Burma during 1949 are highly likely also to be substantially reduced, and itmay prove necessary for a further paper to be submitted in due course setting out proposals for maintaining atan adequate level rice supplies for British territories in South East Asia during 1949.
