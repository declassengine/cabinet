IRON AND STEEL  bill memorandum by the Lord President of the council the Socialisation of Industries Committee, at a meeting held on 7th October, 1948, considered the points on the Iron and Steel Bill raised inthe Minister of Supply&apos;s memorandum (CP. (48) 227), other than the time-tablesubsequent to the passing of the Bill (paragraphs 14 to 22 of the memorandum)which can more appropriately be discussed in Cabinet.Relations between the Minister and the Corporation2. The general view of the Committee is that it is not desirable for theMinister to take the power, as proposed in sub-section (2) of Clause 4 of the draftBill, to control specifically (i) the overall capacity of the industry, (ii) the location of new plants, and (iii) the types, qualities and sizes of the products.3. As indicated in paragraph 6 of the Minister of Supply&apos;s paper(CP. (48) 227), the Minister will have, in other parts of the Bill, general powers in the stock form common to most socialisation statutes which will to a certain extent give him some of the specific powers which he desires : &apos; (i) The Minister will approve the general development programme of theCorporation under sub-section (3) of Clause 4 and this will enable himto press a view on overall capacity, though admittedly this is not adirect power designed to control a recalcitrant Corporation.Presumably, some use could also be made of the power of general direction under sub-section (1).(ii) In regard to the location of new plants, section 14 (4) of the Town aiiclCountry Planning Act, 1947, requires anyone erecting industrial premises to secure a certificate from the Board of Trade. In form,the powers of the Board of Trade are negative in character, whereas the power under Clause 4 (2) would be positive, but the distinction isnot really valid. The Government, by barring a number of areas,could guide the Corporation to the site which the Governmentpreferred. Whatever the legal position, the Government could not force the Corporation to set up new works at a site which the Corporationregarded as objectionable on financial or other grounds, unless it was prepared to offer financial inducements. Further, it is not desirable for two Ministers to have direct statutory powers over the location of industry.(iii) In regard to the control of production, formal powers of detailed control will continue to exist while the Supplies and Services Act remains inoperation.4. The main issue is&quot;not, &quot;however, whether the Minister can secure in lessobtrusive ways the detailed legal powers which he seeks, but whether such meticu-lous statutory control is in accord with the Government&apos;s general socialisationpolicy. That general policy has been to set up public boards with a wide measureof formal independence and with a general responsibility to serve the publicinterest and to pay their way. Experience to date gives good reason to believethat the general powers reserved to the responsible Minister in socialisation359781 -   i Printed for the Cabinet.

legislation, coupled &quot;with the friendly relations which should exist between a minister and his board, are sufficient to secure that effect is given to government policy while at the samedime preserving &apos;a) lull sense of ?r^;bbn&amp;responsibility in the boards.5. All this would be jeopardised by file Minister of Supply&apos;s proposal. Itwould be difficult to get good people to serve on the Iron and Steel Corporation,if (there was a threat of close control and interference by the Minister. Ifdetailedpowers were used, the Corporation would lose its sense of financial responsibility and might demand, or angle for. State subsidies. The day-to-day..management,of the iron and steel indnstry would become a matter for parliamentary &quot;debate,and the Corporation would be tempted to throw on the Minister, rthe responsibilityfor a wide range of necessary but unpopular executive decisions. While the ironand steel industry presents some special features, it has sufficient in common withsome other socialised industries, notably coal, for a change in the form of ministerial supervision to be difficult to defend and troublesome because of its possible repercussions.6. The truth is that socialisation by the use of public boards depends forits efficient working on friendly relations between the responsible Minister andthe board; and in these conditions the board tries to meet the Governmentswishes or indicates what financial or other assistance it must have before it can do so. The powers in sub-section (2) of Clause 4 give the Minister a variety of weapons to deal with a recalcitrant Corporation, but the only practical,course in, such&apos; circumstances would be to change the personnel of the Corporation,;.;&apos;M:\r. One of the strongest arguments for the socialisation of the iron,and steelindustry is that, if the industry were left in private hands, close Governmentsupervision would be required, the running of the industry would be a complicatedaffair and responsibility would be divided in an unfortunate way. The operationof the industry by a public corporation can be shown to be a simpler, more straight-forward, form of administration We lose this advantage, and the useful debatingargument based on it, if we vest detailed powers of supervision in the Minister.Retrospective Dates affecting Contracts, &amp;c. &apos; &apos;    ,,:v:.;: 8.

The Committee favour the retention of Clause 44. They agree with theMinister of Supply that, as a general rule, it is undesirable to provide by statute for consultations between public &quot;boards. In the limited field of carbonisation,however, the Gas Act, 1948, already provides for consultation between Area GasBoards and the National Coal Board, and it seems desirable to follow the precedentthus created and make the statutory provision complete by providing as is donein Clause 44 for consultations between the Iron and Steel Corporation, theNational Coal Board and the Gas Council and Area Boards in regard to develop-ments relating to carbonisation. ... :E^lfiJ &apos; H.
