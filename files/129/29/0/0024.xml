(1+8) 57th Conclusions, Minute 2(1))to make proposals for carrying out in an equitablemanner the decision to suspend releases from the armed Forces.A.V.A.Ministry of Defence,  S.W.1.30th August, I9h8.
S E 0 R E T&apos; SUSPENSION OF RELEASES FROM THE&apos;ARMED FORGESReport of a&apos;Working PartyAt their meeting on 26th August 1948 (CM. (1+8)57th Conclusions)the Cabinet had before them, among other matters, a recommendationfrom the Defence Committee that there should be a generalsuspension of releases from the. Armed Forces for a period up to  -31st March 191+91    The aim of this measure was to remedy the worstdeficiencies of trained and skilled men in the three Services atthe present time, due to the rapid run down of the wartime forcesthrough the operation of the age-and-service release scheme. Theeffect of this measure in terms of forces uniformed manpower isshown by the following figures:Strength at       4- Strength at strength at1st Aug. 191+8        1st Jan. 191+9        1st apI. 191+royal Navy 11+2,000 150,500 &quot;156,500Army ...     1+39,000 1+60,000 1+9.1,000R.A.F. &apos; ...      233?000 254,000 26.8,000814,000 &quot;Sbl+,500 915,500These figures.compare with the planned manpower targets for31st March, 1949s which were -Navy      ...      145,000Army     ...     372,000R.A.F.  ...      226,000743,oooAt the Cabinet meeting on 26th August, it was pointed outthat this suspension of releases would allow the three services to retain considerable numbers of trained and experienced menwho would otherwise go back into civil life.    It would, however,result in the Services, and particularly the Army, being facedwith a major administrative problem in the spring and summer of191+9 when releases were resumed, especially if effect were to begiven to the Government undertaking that the period of colourservice of national servicemen with the Forces should be reducedby 31st December, 194% to one year - which is the term of colourservice at present fixed under the National service Act of 1947for those called up after 1st January, 191+9.    A further practical difficulty, which could not but react adversely on Servicejnorale and cause hardship to a considerable number of personnel,Assuming suspension of releases effective from xsn SeP^emoer:during September about 28,500 men are due to be released from theP/orceSo!-1-
is  that a total suspension of releases for six months would mean that in practice the men so retained could not be released all atonce when releases were recommenced - or indeed very much more quickly than at present planned - for two reasons: first, becausethe release machinery could not cope with the numbers concerned,   -and secondly, because to do so would wreck the structure of theForces, or at any rate of the Army.    It would therefore have tobe a gradual release of retained personnel after a generalresumption of releases, and there would be unavoidable inequalityof treatment among the personnel concerned, mainly in the Army,some men being retained appreciably longer than others.    Thegeneral viev\r of the Cabinet was therefore that the originalrecommendation of the Defence Committee needed, to be amended   insuch a.way as to avoid the difficulties just mentioned, whileachieving the essential object of an immediate strengthening of the Armed Forces during the next six critical months in whichthe Foreign Secretary anticipates that the &quot;cold v/ar&quot; may be decisive.    This was in essence the task remitted to the working party,  and on which we now proceed to submit our proposals.The terms of the Cabinet Conclusion on this point were&quot;The Cabinet -Agreed in principle to the suspension of releases from the armed Forces and invited the Minister ofDefence, to arrange for a working party to formulate,for consideration at a meeting on 31st   August,proposals on the lines indicated by the foreign secretary in (d)  above.&quot;The Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement referred to in this&apos;conclusion is as follows:-&quot;The Foreign Secretary said that it was essential thatany scheme adopted should be equitable. The DefenceCommittee&apos; o recommendations that releases should be suspended for a block period was, however, not equitable,since the burden of additional service would not fallequally on all concerned. The need of the moment wasto retain in the Services,  for the next six months or so, the maximum number of trained men, and the only way to do this and be fair to all concerned was tocall upon each trained man, whatever his length ofservice, to extend his service for an equal periodbeyond the date when in the normal course he would be released.    It would, of course, be necessary to departfrom the dates given in the programme of releaseswhich had already been published, but, provided thatall knew that the burden was being shared equally,this should not lead to serious trouble. The working party proposed by the Minister of Defence should concentrate on finding a solution on these lines.There might also be some readjustment of the intake,if this would serve to promote greater efficiency inthe Armed Forces over the next six months.&quot;1It appeared to the Working Party, therefore,  that three main objects had to be achieved in their proposals;(1) the immediate and progressive strengthening of theForces, i)articularly in trained and skilled men, duringthe next six critical months;(2) achievement of (1) by a method which would have due regard, to the general balance and structure of the
Forces, and of the long-term peacetime shape and size- for which they are being organised, as well asavoiding major administrative difficulties whenreleases are recommenc3d, and(3) minimising the adverse effect on Service morale which any suspension or retardation of releases must have-in some degree, by making sure that the scheme was asequitable as possible as between man and man.It is necessary to indicate briefly certain aspects of thepresent manpower position of the three Services,(i) Royal Navy.Run-down has practically ceased, with.planned Navy numberson an-even keel throughout the financial year:    in actual fact,the present numbers are below the planned lh5,000.    The age-and-service group scheme (i,e, pre-1st January 19h7 call-up) willterminate at the end of November this year,    in some branches all men have already been released, but in certain shortage categoriesmen have been retained beyond the general release date for theirgroup:    the majority of men so retained will have completed two  ,years&apos; service by 1st October this year,(ii) Army.The planned&apos;run-down during the remainder of 19h-8 and inI9I+9 Is still rapid,  as the figures above quoted for let August,19U8, and the target for 1st    April, 197+9, indicate.    The age-and-service release scheme, under the release programme for the last quarter of 191+8 published early in June, is due to finish bythe beginning of November, when part of Group 78 and the wholeof Group 79 (the last remaining male release groups) wouldbe released.    in addition, under the release programme referredto the Army would have begun in November, 191+8, the release ofthe early groups of the &quot;fixed period&quot; men called up in the transition years 19h7 and 191+8 - to the total of 29,000.(iii)    R.A.F.The position is broadly comparable with.that of the Army,the final groups 78 and 79 of the age-and-service scheme beingdue for release in November;     but the R.A.F. do not propose to release any &quot;fixed period&quot; men before January, 191+9,In all three Services there is a shortage of certain important categories of trained and skilled men, partly due tothe fact that the regular components of the Services are stillin the process, of being built up to their post-war level.This shortage is, however, worst in the R.A.F., and - to a lesser degree - in the Army;    in the former, appreciablenumbers of skilled men have already been held back from releaseduring the past month on account of the Berlin air-lift, andthis is a factor which has to be borne in mind in the presentcontext.In considering how to implement the Cabinet&apos;s decision, setout above, on the lines of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement,the Working Party found itself at the outset at variance.  On theone hand, the War Office view was that the Cabinet haddefinitely rejected any plan which involved a total suspension of releases, for however short a period, and the War Officeproposal was therefore for a retardation of the release programme
under which the release of the final age-and-service groups,due to be effected by the end of november,.would instead becompleted by the end of December, 19h8, releases continuing ata somewhat slower rate throughout the period;    while the &quot;fixed period&quot; men whose release was to begin by mid-November, 191+8, wouldbe held to serve the full two years originally proposed for them,their release thus commencing in January, 191+9, with the January,19h7, call-up.    The War Office assume  that this would result inthe strength of the Army at 1st January, 194-9, being 1+10,-000, thatis,- some 28,000 more than if the present planned run-down had continued.   The Army would roughly be maintained approximatelyat 1+00,000 from 1st January onwards,, unless and until&apos;   a decision were taken to resume releases on a more rapid programme.   But itwould in any case be improbable that the Army could get down toan overall one year colour service of its national servicecomponent by 31st December, 191+9,without major administrative andorganisational difficulties.The War Office also consider that a retardation of releasesunder the above plan would have much less disastrous effects onthe morale of the Army, despite the fact that there would be inequitable treatment of personnel in the same age-and-servicerelease group through the extended period during which therelease of the whole group would be effected.    In the: opinion ofthe war office, such inequality is inevitable whether releases areretarded or suspended.    If the latter, when re-opened, releaseswould have to be on a programme of age-and-service and &quot;fixed period&quot; groups,    Since a complete group could never be let outon a single day, some inequality is inescapable in any system ofplanned releases of large numbers.The Admiralty,   Air Ministry and Ministry of labour representatives dissented from the interpretation placed uponthe Cabinet decision by the war Office, and the other two Servicespointed out that the War Office proposals would have no effect at all in strengthening the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force.They -point out that the Cabinet endorsement of the foreign secretary&apos;s proposal for &quot;each trained man whatever his lengthof service to extend his service for an equal period tieyond thedate when in the normal course he would be released&quot; i nvolves inpractice a suspension of releases from the Forces for &apos;the lengthof the period which may be decided for extension of service ofeach man.    A retardation of releases,  on the War Offices plan,would have no practical effect in strengthening the Navy inthe next six or nine months;    the Navy&apos;e needs could only be served by a total suspension for a period.    This would&apos; rcesult inthe retention of some 3,300 age-and-service group men in&quot;shortage&quot; branches.,  and the lengthening of the period ofservice of some of the &quot;fixed period&quot; men beyond two years.The Air Ministry point out that adoption of the War officeProposal for the R*ji.F. would mean they would be forced to release just&apos;those men of training and experience whom they wishto retain;    a suspension of releases for a few months, followedby a resumption of the release programme roughly on the presentlines (including continuance of the present numbers of different-ial releases which has been a feature of the R.A.F. implementation of the age-and-service scheme) would enable the Air Force to preserve its present pattern for the next vital few months, althoughsuch a general stoppage would retain in the R.A.F.  considerable numbers of men outside the main &quot;shortage&quot; trades in which thereal need arises.
If the Cabinet decide upon a general suspension of releases in accordance with, the plan proposed by the majority of theWorking party the latter suggest that the period should be notless, than three months:&apos;  that is, it would be announced that each man now serving would be held to serve three months beyondthe date when he would normally have been released, and thiswould apply equally to the &quot;fixed period&quot; men whose releasewould have begun on lot January, 19h9s (or earlier in the caseof the Army under the present programme).The majority of the Working Party considered that aproposal on these lines, whereby each man (until further notice)will serve a minimum of three months more than he had expected,is the only method which will enable all three Forces to be appreciably strengthened in men of experience and skill duringthe next six critical months.    The War Office representativefound himself unable to subscribo to this plan, owing to theserious organisational and administrative problems entailed forthe Army and the anticipated serious effect on morale.In this last connection, the representatives of all three services stressed the desirability of the actual suspension of releases following as closely as possible upon the announcementof such suspension, if this is determined upon.    It was thegeneral viev/ of the Cabinet on 26th August that the suspension of releases should operate on 1st October rather than 1stSeptember, the announcement being made early in the new sessionof Parliament (i.e, on li+th September or soon after).    TheService Departments strongly urged that if the announcement,for political reasons, is to be made when Parliament meets onlhth September, suspension should be made effective at once or within the following day or two:    this will involve practicaldifficulties to the Navy and the Air Force, whose release scheme^broadly works by complete groups each month;    but they regard thitas less important than the danger of active discontent in theServices,, and especially in the Army where large numbers wouldbe involved, if there is a considerable interval between theannouncement and effecting of the suspension of releases,particularly in the more distant overseas theatres.  The case ofmen who are due to commence the academic year at universities,colleges, etc, early in October could no doubt be met by^individual release, if any general suspension were to operatebefore 1st October.The effect on Service numbers: of the alternative proposals would be as follows.1st aup;. 19U8.     Three months     Yfer office(For comparison) extra service   Plan for-&quot;*&quot;- as from 1st       retarded&quot;&quot;Oct. reieaseoTIsE Jan. 19h9* 1st Jan.l9h9Navy        ...

Tjhe Working Party did not consider the question of adjusting the national service intake into the Forces, over* the next six months in connection with the problem ofsuspending or retarding releases, since that question does notappear to have any major effect upon the problem of suspension orretardation of releases.    It will of course fall to be consideredby the Working Party on the possible amendments to the National.   Service Act of 191+7.The majority of the Working Party advise the Cabinet(1) that there should bo a suspension of releases from the Forcesoperative as from 1st October, or preferably as nearly as possible to any announcement of such suspension;(2) that the announcement should state that in view ofthe special demands made on the Armed Forces by thepresent world situation and the policy of Western union,personnel in the Forces should have their serviceextended for a minimum period of three months beyondthe date when in the normal course they would have been released;(3) that the operation of (1) and (2) above should be reviewed in accordance with the developing international situation and commitments- of the Armed Forces, with aview, to re-starting the release programme as soon aspossible in 19U9;(h) that discharges of personnel on termination of regulaa?engagements with the colours should proceed normally(5) that releases and discharges of v/omen should proceednormally.The War Office representative is unable to agree, with theforegoing recommendations (except (d) and (5)), and proposes that thereshould be the maximum retardation of releases from the earliestpossible date (i.e.  date of implementing the scheme), but so framed that all age-and-cervice group men in the Forces shouldbe out by the end of 19hS,&apos;  Thereafter, and throughout 19h9,releases would continue at a very much slower rate than is now contemplated, and on the basic that every national servicemanwould complete two years&apos;  service.    The strength of the Army andthe length of national service would thus be stabilised from 1st  January, 19h9, onwards.Signed on behalf of the Working PartyA.  J.
