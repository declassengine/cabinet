Although there are some six weeks to go beforeProrogation, it has seemed desirable to get as much as possible of the Prorogation Speech settled before the Recess.      Theremay need to be revision in the light of events;    and indeed,  aswill be seen, paragraphs 5 and 16,  relating to Germany and palestine respectively, have been left blank at this stage.3. The Opening Speech is brief and requires no comment.It follows roughly the precedent of the Speech delivered onthe Opening of Parliament for. the short Session ofDecember, 1921,  summoned for the purpose of ratifying theArticles of the Irish Agreement.H.M.COPY NO.      *\Office of the Lord President of the Council, S.W.  1,,26t-h July, 19h3.
Draft Prorogation -Speech, 1947/48 session my LORDS AND. MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF commons.      Throughout tne Session which is now -ending economic difficulties have gravely delayed the recovery of all thecountries of the eastern hemisphere.      Through the sustainedenergies of My people in achieving a great and continuingexpansion of exports and their resolute acceptance of a prolonged period of Inevitable difficulty progress has beenmade in redressing the adverse &quot;balance of payments:hut world circumstances have proved unfavourable, andfurther effort and sacrifice   will be needed if the problem is to be &apos; surmounted.      A great contribution towardslessening our dependence on imports has been made by our agricultural industry, all sections of which have responded tothe call for increased production.      In the face of worldshortages My Ministers have vigorously sought both to establish new sources of supply of foodstuffs and to safe-guard the future by entering Into long-term agreements with overseas countries.2.      The way before us Is still hard, and it    is only withcourage and endurance, and by intensifying our present effortr,that we can5 under God, overcome our difficulties and attainto that degree of prosperity and well-being for which we all hope.3.      In these anxious times we have all been encouraged by thefar-sighted and generous action of the United States of Americain extending financial assistance to the United Kingdom andother European countries.      My Government are determined to
work with the Government of the United. States anal wxtir other-European Governments to bring about tne ftailest possible measure of European recovery &quot;&amp;y the wise Hiss &quot;both, of our am.resources and of the aid afforded us.      So this end they have entered into the Convention for European Economic Co-operation,and have recently signed the Economic Co-operationAgreement with the United. States.4.      Close links have been forged with -ova? neighbours in western Europe^      A Treaty of Economic, Social and CulturalCollaboration and Collective Self-Defence has been signed withthe Governments of Belgium, France, DusemboTuUPg and theNetherlands;    permanent machinery for the co-ordinationof defence with those countries has been established;and satisfactory progress is being made on the othermatters with which the Treaty deals.      It Is My prayer thatout of these hopeful beginnings there will develop an evercloser degree of union between all the countries of Weste-r-nEurope;    and that, ultimately In furtherance of the aims of the United Nations, they may, with their commonheritage of culture and freedom, constitute an area of peace,prosperity and ordered progress, in association with the peoples of My Commonwealth overseas and witls. the UnitedStates of America.5.      /K paragraph on Germany, to be supplied later bythe Foreign Office.J76.
