this document is  the property of his  britannic majesty&apos;s goyernmentSECRET. Copy No. 3 1CP. (48) 22811th October, 1948CABINET.COUNCIL  FOR WALES AND MONMOUTHSHIREMemorandum by the Lord President of the council the Government, in 1946, rejected a proposal for a Secretary of State for wales but agreed that there should be a quarterly conference of the heads ofGovernment Offices in Wales, an annual White Paper on Government activities in Wales and an annual Welsh Debate in the House of Commons.2. There is, however, still some pressure for the appointment of a minister with special but ill-defined responsibility for Welsh Affairs; and there has, fromtime to time, been a demand for the establishment of a Council, representative ofimportant Welsh interests, which would bring to a focus Welsh opinion on matters affecting Government policy in Wales. Moreover, as the Cabinet foresawwhen they authorised the establishment of the Scottish Economic Conference(CM. (48) 6th Conclusions, Minute 4) there has been some pressure for aconference of the same kind in Wales; and the Prime Minister undertook toconsider whether, and to what extent, the administrative arrangements recently made in Scotland could usefully be applied to Wales (Commons Debates,2nd February, 1948, cols. 1474-5).3. I have now received from the Welsh Regional Council of Labour amemorandum of proposals (copy attached as Appendix II) which have beenagreed between the Regional Council and the Welsh Parliamentary Labour Group.The Council and the Group are anxious to have an early meeting with ministers to discuss the memorandum. Their main proposal is for the establishment of a council for Wales and Monmouthshire, under the chairmanship of a Ministerof Cabinet rank representing a Welsh constituency, which would consist ofrepresentatives of local authorities and of various existing organisations in Wales.The terms of reference would follow those of the Scottish Economic Conferenceand, in addition, the Council would provide a link between cultural organisationsin Wales and the Government and would advise the Government on the impact of legislation on the general life of the Principality.4. The Machinery of Government Committee, assisted by the Minister ofHealth and the Minister of National Insurance, have examined this proposal.We consider that in all the circumstances it would be advisable to concede therequest for a Council.We are, however, wholly opposed to the suggestion that the chairman of theCouncil should be a Minister. (In this connection it should be noted that the regional Council of Labour avows the aim of obtaining the appointment of a minister for Welsh Affairs at some future date.) We have considered various alternative arrangements for the appointment of the chairman, and have reachedthe conclusion that the least objectionable arrangement would be for the Councilto appoint a chairman from among its members. We also consider that the termsof reference of the Council, as proposed by the Welsh Regional Council of Labour,will require modification.I set out, in Appendix I to this paper, a statement of the terms of reference and composition of the proposed Council which has been prepared in the lightof the views of the Machinery of Government Committee.5. It seems to be clear that Welsh opinion attaches importance to theexistence of a close link between any consultative council and Ministers.   The35976 bPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1948
Machinery of Government Committee considered in some detail how this mightbe achieved without eacquraging the ill-considered demand for a Minister for welsh Affairs. We recommend that the proposed Council should periodically(perhaps once a year) indicate subjects which it would wish to discuss with a minister or Ministers and that a Minister of Cabinet rank the choice of whom:would depend on the main subject to be discussed should meet the Council,possibly accompanied by one or more Parliamentary Secretaries in respect of other subjects which the Council wished to discuss.6. I shall be glad if I may have the authority of the Cabinet for one or twoof my colleagues and myself to discuss with the Regional Council of Labour andthe Welsh Parliamentary Labour Group the constitution of a Council on thelines indicated in Appendix I with the ministerial link outlined in the preceding paragraph. Thereafter it will be necessary to discuss the matter with the WelshParliamentary Party. Subject to any modifications suggested as a result ofthese discussions, the establishment of the Council could then be announced during the next annual Welsh Debate, unless circumstances indicated the needfor an earlier announcement.H.

Welsh Members of Parliament have long been conscious of a deepeningdesire among the Welsh people for increased opportunities of dealing with matters of purely Welsh concern; and Welsh, Labour Members have with othersmade various proposals from time to time designed to improve the handling of welsh affairs.2, We feel that,: in spite of certain inevitable limitations which the subjoinedproposals are designed to overcome at least partially, the &quot; Welsh Day &quot; in theHouse of Commons has focused attention on some of our special problemsSimilarly, the publication of an annual White Paper on Wales and Monmouthshireis a step in the right direction, while the increasing tendency to regard the principality as a unit wherever practicable for the purposes of government isdeservedly welcomed,3. There is evidence of developing opinion in Wales in favour of measuresaccording recognition to the Principality as a distinctive part of the Kingdomand affording its people a fuller voice in shaping government policy as appliedto its needs and peculiarities. There is no need for this reasonable sentimentto be perverted, by political nationalism if social democracy shows itself capableof imaginative and effective action to meet this sentiment. The Prime Minister,speaking on behalf of the Government has stated &apos;&apos; that we are agreed about the objective- meeting the true needs and interests of the Welsh people and differonly about the best means of achieving it.&quot; Our proposals are designed to offersuch a means. They aim at ensuring that the interests of the Principality are fully reflected in all aspects of national policy.4. The Quarterly Conference of Heads of Departments in Cardiff hasfulfilled a useful function, but it has a number of limitations : (a) It is a purely reporting, inter-departmental body.  It has no satisfactoryliaison with the Welsh people or with the Government.(b) Its Chairman is one of the Heads of Department, and as such has no particular standing or authority.(c) It gives rise in Wales to a feeling that in so far as there is anyco-ordination and direction of Government activity in Wales, it is bya bureaucracy.(d) It is in no sense a sounding board for Welsh opinion.   At present wehave a series of ad hoc conferences, convened with difficulty, lacking incontinuity of action, ill-informed, and of little value to the WelshMembers of Parliament or to the Government in keeping them properlyaware of considered opinion in Wales.5. The changes we suggest hereunder are moderate and immediately prac-ticable. We believe that they would evoke among the Welsh people a furtherexpression of their belief in democracy.A Council of Wales and Monmouthshire6. We, therefore, propose the creation of a Council for Wales and Mon-mouthshire, constituted in such a way that it can in part or as a whole act as aWelsh Economic Conference with functions analogous to that proposed for Scot-land, and be advisory to the Government also on social and cultural matters affecting the Principality.   Such a Council would have the oversight generally of35976 b 2

We propose that a Minister of Cabinet rank, representing a Welsh Con-stituency should preside over the Council.The Question of a Minister for Wales8. We have closely considered the possibility of the appointment of a minister for Welsh Affairs, as distinct from a -Secretary4^ &quot;State,&apos; ^cabinet while we make no proposal on these lines at this juncture, we maintain the aim of obtaining the fulfilment of such an appointment at a future date.      ,.;       ;-. /.Consideration of Welsh Affairs in Parliament .,,...., :     -9. We consider that the &quot; Welsh Day &quot; as at present is too; diffuse to be of full value either to Wales or to the Government. 110 We therefore propose that two days in each Session be devoted in theHouse to Welsh Affairs. A possible arrangement would be : one day to economic matters (including agriculture) and one day to educational and social questions.Conduct of Welsh Debates11. We propose that one of the Ministers in charge of these Welsh debatesshould be the Minister acting as Chairman of the Welsh Council.The White Paper on Government A ctivity in Wales and Monmouthshire12. We propose that this Minister should be responsible for preparing andpresenting the Annual White Paper on Wales and that it should include :-\a) A statement of policy trends, past and present, in the Principality.(b) A statement of all facts and figures relating to the Principality in anannually comparable manner.Information Relating to the Principality13.   We propose : (a) That estimates be presented to the House in such a way as to show theposition of the Principality.(b) That the Monthly Digest of Statistics and similar publications be similarly improved.Delegation of Powers to Welsh Offices -14.   That in the matter of the delegation of administrative powers, wales and Monmouthshire should as far as possible be treated as a unit.Review of Government Machinery15.   That in any inquiry, conducted by the Government into questions of delegation or devolution, the Welsh position be examined.Finance - . .16. The cost of the operation of the Council will be borne by national funds.The scale of remuneration of the personnel of the Secretariat will be fixed by theGovernment, and the scale of expenses on account of attendances to be drawn bymembers of the Council will be that common in local Government or national government practice.
