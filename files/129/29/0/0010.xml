1 SECBET Copy No.     31CP. (38) 2004th August, 1948CABINETLEGISLATION  IN THE  1947-^8  SESSIONNote by the Lord President of the council the legislative work of the 1947-48 Session of Parliament was completed on 30th July. In this Session, which has lasted for 40J weeks, 68 Acts havebeen passed. In the 1946-47 Session, which lasted for 39 weeks, 55 Acts were passed, but rather more of them were large and contentious. I should like toexpress my appreciation of the services rendered by my colleagues, and particularly by the Leader of the House of Lords, the Chief Whip and the other Whipsin both Houses, in carrying through the 1947-48 programme of legislation.2. My colleagues may be interested to see the attached classified List(Annex &quot;A&quot;) of the Acts which have been passed in the 1947-48 Session. Ihave grouped these under the following heads : *(a) Legislation foreshadowed in the King&apos;s Speech.(6) Other important legislation (i.e., essential, major or medium-sized Acts)not foreshadowed in the King&apos;s Speech.(c) Minor Acts.(d) Routine Acts.(e) Consolidation and Statute Law Revision Acts.3. With the exception of the Parliament Bill, all the legislation mentionedin the King&apos;s Speech has been passed.4. During the course of the Session it has been found necessary to pass14 Acts not included in the Legislative Programme approved by the Cabinet inOctober 1947 (CM. (47) 80th Conclusions, Minute 2). On the other hand., as annex &quot; B &quot; shows, 10 Bills which were either included in the programme approved by the Cabinet or added to it during the course of the Session wereeventually abandoned or postponed until a later Session.5. It will be recalled that in July 1947 (CM. (47) 64th Conclusions..Minute 4) the Cabinet approved proposals by the Lord Chancellor for the reform of the Statute Law, including the reconstitution of the Statute Law Committeeand the establishment of a special consolidation branch in the Office of Parliamen-tary Counsel. The Lord Chancellor is to be congratulated on the success of these new arrangements which have led to the passage of four consolidation Acts anda Statute Law Revision Act in the present Soooinnession.H M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S.W. 1,4th August, 1948.35707this  document is   THE property OF his  britannic  MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERHMEKTPrinted for the Cabinet.
