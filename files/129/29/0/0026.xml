HIS D0CII/1ENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot;&apos; S GOVERNMENTSECRET ,      jtgg^ CP. (48) 216 COPY NO, 3 1 .2nd September. 1948CABINETPREPARATION FOR DEFENCE; suspension of RELEASESMemorandum by the Secretory of State for WarSUSPENSION OF RELEASES1. The Cabinet at their meeting on 26th Augustagreed in principle to the suspension of releases from the armed Forces and invited the Minister of Defence toarrange for a &quot;working Party to formulate for consideration at a meeting on 3rd September proposals on the lines indicated by the Foreign Secretary at the Cabinet meetingon 26th August.2. The Working Party recommends that men in theForces should have their service extended for a minimum *iperiod of three months beyond the date when in the normal course they would have been released.     They also con-sider that the matter- saouid be reviewed in accordancewith the developing international situation and the commitments of the &quot;&quot;armed Forces with a view to re-startingthe release programme as soon as possible in 1949.EFFECT OF IMPLEMENTING THE PROPOSAL AS REGARDS THE ARMYif3. Present planned ceiling for the Army, inclusive of women, is as follows,-- &quot;(a) 1st January, 194S    -    371,000(b) 1st April, 1949       -     339,000(c) 1st January, 1950    - - of the order of 300p00.4. The implementation of the proposal might resultin the Army having a strength of some 440,000 (inclusive of women) on 1st January, 1949.5, The strength on 1st April, 1949, on the assumptionthat the release programme is re-opened on 1st January, 1949&amp; at a similar rate to that promulgated for 1st October, 1948to 1st January, 1949, would be some 410,000 (inclusive ofwomen).6, Subsequent strengths during 1949 would depend onthe rate of release and whether the period of NationalService remains 1 year for men called up during 1949.   inthe latter event the ceiling on;1st January, 1950, could notexceed a strength of the order of 300,000,/ 7. Difficulties.
/ 16.   The outcomeDIFFICULTIES,7. While it is clear that the stoppage of release for^three months would assist the Arpy to meet its commitmentsduring the remainder of 1948 and during the early part of1949, it is also apparent that it would not enable us to escape from the many difficulties with which we are atpresent confronted.8o The Army on present plans will have completed therelease of men who entered before 1947 by early November,&apos; 1948. All these men have been given a pledge that they wouldbe out before 1949.    The stoppage of release from 1stOctober to 1st January, 1949, would entail the retentionof some 35,000 of these men into 1949 and their releasewouldnot.be completed&apos;at the earliest, before say mid-      ,February, 1949.   After that date the release of men called up for a fixed period of 2 years in 1947 would presumablystart, but- some of these men would by that date have alreadybeen kept for over 2 years. Thus the stoppage of releasewould break two principles to which sen in the Army havegiven great weight and which it has generally been understood would be observed in any situation short of a mostserious emergency,9, While these factors are not paramount and must be judged in relation to the present situation there are other and more fundamental draw-backs in the solution.10. The stoppage of releases must, as has been indicated, be followed by the resumption of demobilisation and at a rapid rate if the strengths shown in paragraphs and 4(c) are to be reached.11. It is just this rapid rate of demobilisationwhich at present militates against the efficiency of theArmy to fulfil its commitmrjsts.12. Moreover such a stoppage leaves the Army withouta known ceiling even six months ahead on which to plan.13. All planning in relation to Orders of Battle, thetraining of the National Service intake, allocation of reinforcements and the allotment of shipping both to bringmen due for release home and to take reinforcements totheatres abroad, must of necessity be planned at least sixmonths ahead.14. Thus the solution proposed while assisting the army for 3 months during which it is in operation only postponesour present difficulties and perpetuates these in a more acute form when releases are re-started.CONCLUSION..15. The. Cabinet at their meeting on 26th August, whilstconsidering the suspension of releases also invited theMinister of Defence to arrange for- a Working Party to make a.comprehensive review of the National Service Act.
16. The outcome of this review will have animportant bearing on the difficulties which I have set out,I would therefore emphasise that if the suspension of release is adopted as a short term or. interim measure thecompletion of &quot;this review of the National Service Actbecomes a matter of considerable urgency since the positionof the Forces after the resumption of releases in 1949 willbe conditioned by the conclusions reached on the NationalService Act.I must, however, indicate that if it should be.decided to amend the National Service Act, 1949, providingfor an extension of the-- period of service from 12 months to 18 months or 2 years, that in itself would not enable us to escape from our difficulties.   But if, coincident withsuch an extension, all men compulsorily enlisted before theend of 1948 had to serve.for 18 months or 2 years which,should there be an amendment to the National Service Act,1949, is the logical step to take, it would be of materialadvantage to the Army,,17. I would also emphasise the importance of makingthe implementation of whatever course may be taken in regardto releases coincident with the announcement in the House^on the subject.   This is necessary because, in the case ofthe Army, certain release groups now open do not close forsome months, and an announcement ahead of action being takenwould thus lead to the greatest difficulty in settlingwhich men in a group, would have their releases stopped,E SThe War Office,2nd September, 1948,
