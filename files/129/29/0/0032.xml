FORMER ITALIAN COLONIESNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a report by myDeputy, Sir Noel Charles, on the recent meeting in London of the Deputiesappointed by the Powers represented on the Council of Foreign Ministers toconsider the question of the former Italian Colonies.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,13th September, 1948.Sir, Foreign Office, -3rd September, 1948.I have the honour to submit herewith a copy of the Recommendations to theCouncil of Foreign Ministers, signed by the four Deputies appointed by theirrespective Foreign Ministers, regarding the question of the disposal of the formerItalian Colonies. The Recommendations were drawn up in accordance with theprovisions of Article 23 of the Peace Treaty with Italy and Annex XI (thejoint Declaration of the Governments of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom,the United States of America, and France in regard to the Italian territorialpossessions in Africa). The Deputies of the four Powers were Mr. LewisDouglas, the United States Ambassador, M. G. N. Zaroubin, the soviet ambassador, M. Rene Massigli, the French Ambassador, and myself.2. The meetings of the Deputies began on 3rd October, 1947, and for thefirst two months were mainly concerned with the organisation and despatch ofthe Commission of Investigation. During the absence of the Commission the deputies considered matters arising out of the investigation and proceduralquestions concerning the interested Governments and the presentation of theirviews. On the return of the Commission at the end of May their reports werecirculated to the interested Governments (i.e., the signatories of the Peace treaty as well as Italy and Egypt), whose further views were invited, and regular dailymeetings were then held for the purpose of drafting recommendations for theCouncil of Foreign Ministers in the light of those views and the reports of theCommission.3. The meetings passed off on the whole in an atmosphere of calm, brokenevery now and then by an altercation between the Soviet representative and hiscolleagues, when the latter became exasperated at their Russian colleague &apos;sexaggerated insistence on details of procedure. It can truly be said that had this question of deciding the fate of the former Italian Colonies been left to thef three Western Powers to settle, some more satisfactory solution would have beenfound in a few meetings. The chief difficulty of the British representative wasin ensuring that the right of the British Dominions to present their views at different stages in the proceedings should be respected on the ground that notonly were they signatories of the Peace Treaty, but that their troops had played a principal part in liberating the territories concerned. The Russian Deputy feltthat the views of Byelorussia, for example, were as important as those of theDominions, as they had contributed as much to winning the war.Printed, for the Cabinet.

4. The Deputies agreed that a Commission of Investigation should beappointed in accordance with Annex XI of the Peace Treaty, and should visitin succession Eritrea, Italian Somaliland, and Libya to report on general condi-tions, taking into consideration the wishes and welfare of the inhabitants andthe interests of peace and security. The Commission duly left the UnitedKingdom on 8th November, 1947, and accomplished their task in the time specified,returning to London at the end of May 1948. They completed the writing oftheir reports by the end of July. Their reports, which are valuable documentsfor an understanding of the territories and their complicated social, economic,and political problems, are by no means unanimous, and it became clear in their first meetings in Eritrea that political considerations were going to swing the opinions of the French and Russian members, M. Burin des Roziers andM. Feodorov, who were bent on finding all evidence which could favour the returnto Italy of her former colonies. The British representative, Mr. Frank Stafford,C.B.E., and his American colleague, Mr. John Utter, concentrated on trying tofind out the true feelings of the population, and their reports in each of the three territories were identical in almost all essential respects. The French and Russianreports on Eritrea and Italian Somaliland were similar to one another and alludefrequently to the &quot; inefficiency &quot; and &quot; bias &quot; of the British Military Administra-tion. After the Commission arrived in Libya the French representative, possiblybecause of complaints which the Foreign Office had made privately to the french ambassador and of the impending visit to French-controlled territory, began tobehave in a manner less offensive to his British and American colleagues, andhis change of attitude is apparent in the reports of the Commissioners. the franco-Russian alliance completely disintegrated in the Fezzan, where the soviet representative was, if anything, more anti-French than he had been anti-Britishin our territories.5. A point which became clear to the British and United States represen-tatives, and doubtless to the Soviet representative, was the different conceptionwhich the French and the British had concerning their duties under the hague convention as Occupying Powers of these ex-Italian Colonies. In the British-occupied territories our administrations have acted as caretakers, whereas in theFezzan the French have gone to some lengths to obliterate all signs of Italianadministration, and to incorporate the area into French Africa, and haveobviously used every means to make the population amenable to the continuation of a French regime. Considering the difficulties of the occasion and the usuallyunhelpful and often hostile attitude of the French and Russian representatives,I think much credit is due to Mr. Stafford, on whom fell much of the burdenof keeping things going in his capacity of host and intermediary between the staffof the Commission and the British Military Administrations.6. In March it became apparent that the Russians were not interested inthe work of the Commission as a basis on which to form their decision about the fate of the colonies, since in the Italian elections, which took place on 17th April,they thought it more important to make a bid for the votes of the Italian popu-lation for the Italian Communist Party by announcing unequivocal Soviet support for the return of all her colonies to Italy. Shortly after the Russians decided tomake this announcement they recalled the head of their delegation to moscow and he did not return.7. Boundary questions occupied the- attention of the Deputies throughout their discussions. The boundary between Italian Somaliland and the Ethiopianprovince of the Ogaden remains as big a problem as it was when the Wal Walincident, from which resulted the attack on Ethiopia, occurred, and it now forms the subject of a tripartite recommendation by the British, American, and Frenchdelegations. A British claim to a small piece of Italian Somaliland, and a Frenchclaim to a revision of the French Somaliland-Eritrea border have both receivedthe support of their colleagues to the exclusion of the Russian. I stated a case for altering the Tripolitania-Cyrenaica boundary, so as to include within thelatter territory the Senussi tribes whose political allegiance is given to the AmirSayid Idris. Claims by Egypt for revision of their frontier with Libya, and theFrench claims on Libya were not discussed by the Deputies. The Soviet Deputykept aloof from the discussion of boundary questions by maintaining that the frontiers of all the Colonies should be those which were effective on1st January, 1934.8. A feature of the final meetings was that, although each Deputy tabledthe recommendation of his Government for the disposal of each territory, only theBritish Deputy stated in some detail the reasons for his recommendations.  There
was seldom any discussion of the merits of a proposal, and there was no openattempt to endeavour to reconcile differing points of view. The uncompromisingrefusal of the Soviet Deputy to consider dfeaagiiLg even a single word of hispredetermined formula ruled out any nope of agreement by a process of give and take. In brief, the result is that the I^epnties lave merely narrowed the problemof disposal by recording a statement of pacifism fey each of the Four Powers.The only territory about which there was aay semblance of agreement by theFour Powers is Italian Somaliland, but laere. too. the grant of the trusteeshipto Italy is tied by certain conditions-9. The signature of the Eeeommendatirans by the Deputies took place on31st August. A copy signed by all. four Depaties was handed by the Secretary-General to each Deputy for submission to Ms Minister.10. The Soviet Deputy, who was .chairsaam off the meeting, recalled the termsof the Italian Peace Treaty and requested ifc views of his colleagues with regardto the procedure for the further study of tks question of the former italian colonies. The United States Deputy said that this was a matter for the ministers themselves to determine. The French I3epu?y/ said that he was without instruc-tions. As British Deputy I recalled that I had suggested the insertion of a phrasein the record of decisions of the preceding UEseiiMg in. order to clarify the positionof His Majesty&apos;s Government, namely: that it was for the Foreign ministers to determine the further steps to be taken. The Soviet Deputy declared that&apos;&apos; So far as the Soviet delegation is eoneeraed the Soviet Government standsfirmly on the fulfilment of the Treaty. The Soviet delegation considers that theCouncil of Foreign Ministers should consider that question before 14th September,1948.  That is the position of the Soviet GovesiMnent-&quot;I have the honour to be, with the highest respect.Sir,Your EEusit obedient, humble Servant.(Signed)        NOEL CHARLES.

In accordance with Article 23 of tike Peace Treaty with Italy and annex XI (the Joint Declaration of the Governments off the Soviet Union, theUnited Kingdom, the United States of America, and France in regard to theItalian territorial possessions in Africa) the Deputies of the Foreign ministers on instructions from the Council of Foreign MJmJsteis, doling; the past year :(a) Have continued to consider the question off the disposal of the formerItalian Colonies;(b) have sent a Four-Power Commission of Investigation to Eritrea, italian somaliland and Libya in order to collect tie necessary data on these colonies and to ascertain the views of tike local population;(c) have studied the three reports on the results off Hie investigation of Eritrea,Italian Somaliland and Libya submitted hj the Four-Power Corn-mission to the Deputies and have dlsfaitomtedl them to all the other interested Governments as well as to the Governments of egypt and Italy;(d) have studied the views of the other interested Governments as well asthose of the Governments of Egypt and Italy on the disposal of theformer Italian Colonies which were presented orally or in written form to the Deputies. Views were expressed iby the following governments in addition to Egypt and Italy: China. Australia, Belgium, Byelo-russia, Brazil, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Ethiopia,. Greece, India,the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, the Ukraine, the Union ofSouth Africa, Yugoslavia, and Pakistani-II. As a result of this work the Deputies decided to submit to the Councilof Foreign Ministers of the U.S.S.R., the United Kimgdom, the United Statesand France, the following recommendations: A.

[of Italy]&quot;system of the United Nations with Italy ,-as the adBmieistering authorityJ*&quot;The United Kingdom, United States and French Deputies recommend thatthe duration of Italian trusteeship should be undefined.][The Deputy of the U.S.S.R. recommends that the Italian trusteeship shouldbe fixed for a definite and acceptable term.]u.s.s.r. [All the former Italian colonies in Africa, namely Ubya, Eritrea and italian somaliland, to be placed under the trusteeship of Italy within those frontierswhich existed on 1st January, 1934, fixed in accordance with treaties and agree-ments in force at that time concluded between the ^interested Governmentsconcerned. ]-gS [Ethiopian-Italian Somaliland Frontier. Pending final settlement of theu.k. frontier between Ethiopia and Italian Somaliland the lime to which the british military Administration is withdrawing on the eraematioin from the Ogadenshould be the provisional boundary without prejudice to the final settlement.* The United Kingdom agreement is conditional ran a sdhmitiom satisfactory to them being reached as regards Eritrea.
A map showing the approximate position of the provisional line to which theBritish Military Administration in the Ogaden will withdraw is attached.The Ethiopian Government should be asked to state whether they would accept this provisional line as the permanent frontier between Ethiopia andE Italian Somaliland in accordance with previous agreements between the Ethiopianand Italian Governments. If the Ethiopian Government reply that they doregard this provisional line as the permanent frontier, then all that will benecessary will be the appointment of a boundary commission to demarcate thisfrontier.If, on the other hand, the Ethiopian Government reply that they do not regard this line as a satisfactory permanent frontier, they should be urged bythe Council of Foreign Ministers to agree upon the appointment of a boundary commission by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.It would be the duty of such a boundary commission to take into account the views of the Ethiopian and Italian Governments and to decide upon aboundary which, Avhile based on the relevant previous treaties, in particular the Italo-Ethiopian Convention of 1908, satisfies the administrative requirements ofboth parties and the interests of the inhabitants on each side of the frontier. Ininterpreting the Italo-Ethiopian Convention of 1908, the frontier to the east of the Webi Shebelli should be assumed to be a straight line drawn from the pointfixed by the Convention on the Webi Shebelli to the point 480 East, 8&quot; North,unless official documents are produced which show that the agreement of 1897provided for some other specific line. The boundary commission should take their decisions by a majority vote.The Ethiopian Government should be asked to give their consent to thisproposal within three months of 15th September, 1948.British Somaliland-Italian Somaliland FrontierThe frontier between British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland from Hididto the Gulf of Aden should follow the 49th meridian of longitude thus includingwithin British Somaliland the locality of Bender Ziada.]B.-ERITREA[That the former Italian colony of Eritrea be placed under the trusteeship U.S.S.R.of Italy for a definite acceptable term.]The position of the Delegation of the U.S.S.R. on the question of the frontier u.s.s.R.of Eritrea is stated in section A.[1.   Ethiopia should be appointed to be administering authority in Eritrea u.K.for a period of ten years.2. At the end of ten years the General Assembly of the United nations would decide whether, and if so under what conditions, Ethiopian administra-tion should continue indefinitely.3. An Advisory Council would be appointed to assist the&apos; EthiopianAdministration. This Council would consist of local Eritreans and therepresentatives of four Powers, for instance, Italy, Switzerland, a Scandinaviancountry and a Moslem State.4. The rights and position of the various groups, Italians, Moslems,Copts, &amp;c, should be governed by a special statute which might include provisionfor separate law courts, for education, for religious rights, &amp;c.5. This Advisory Council, in addition to its advisory functions, should also have the power to suspend any legislation on certain reserved subjects under (4)above introduced by the Ethiopian Administration. It would then be open to thelatter to ask the Eritrean Commission referred to in (6) to confirm the legislation,and if the Commission agreed to confirm it the suspension would then lapse.6. The Advisory Council and the Ethiopian Administration would reportfrom time to time to a special Eritrean Commission of the United Nations. this commission would be quite distinct either from the Trusteeship Council or the trusteeship Committee of the General Assembly. It should number some eightor nine representatives of States Members of the United Nations, chosen for reasons of disinterestedness, experience in administration of backward peoples,and&apos; not being States represented on the Advisory Council. The commission would hold sessions every few months.]

Deputy of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Union of soviet socialist Republics :Lancaster House, London, S.W. 1,31st August, 1948.ANNEX a united Kingdom, United States and FranceItalian SomalilandMethod of transfer the three Delegations suggest that, in order that there should be no doubt as to the method of transfer, the decision of the Ministers should be formulatedas follows : 1. The four Powers, acting in accordance with the powers which have beenconferred on them by Annex XI of the Treaty of Peace, invite Italy to undertake the provisional administration of her former colony of Italian Somaliland witha view to placing it under the trusteeship system of the United Nations with italy as the administering authority. In accepting this invitation, Italyundertakes :(1) to abide by the terms of the agreement which will establish, in accordancewith the Charter of the United Nations, terms of trusteeship applicableto Italian Somaliland;(2) to accept the frontier arrangements specified in the Recommendations andthe arrangements mentioned in Annex B.2. The administration of former Italian Somaliland will be transferred bythe Government of the United Kingdom to the Italian Government at such date(not later than 15th January, 1949) as may be agreed between the Government ofthe United Kingdom and the Italian Government.3. The above-mentioned conditions shall be an integral part of the decisionof the Council of Foreign Ministers and if they are not acceptable to Italy thisdecision of the Council of Foreign Ministers, shall become null and void,and the question of the disposal of Italian Somaliland shall, in accordance withAnnex XI of the Treaty of Peace with Italy, then be.submitted to the general assembly of the United Nations for a recommendation.[Whilst the United Kingdom Government would examine with sympathy UK-the possibility of repatriating to Tripolitania those Italians who still have homes and families in that territory they must record that so long as they have to fulfil their responsibilities as Occupying Power they must give first considerationto the maintenance of law and order and to the welfare and safety of the popula-tion including the existing Italian colonists. Any additional repatriation would therefore have to be very carefully considered from that point of view by the occupying Power. These considerations apply to any territory in which theUnited Kingdom Government may be the Occupying Power.]TThe United Kingdom also proposes  that the present administrative v.K.boundary between Cyrenaica and Tripolitania should be moved westward so asto include within the former the Sirtica area and other predominantly Senussiareas. This line should be demarcated by a boundary commission to be constitutedby the administrations concerned.]The attached Annexes A, B, C, D and E form part of the present document.Deputy of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the UnitedKingdom :Deputy of the Secretary of State of the United States of America :Deputy of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the French Republic :
sANNEX BUnited Kingdom, United States and FranceItalian SomalilandEconomic and Financial provisions. Italy should agree to negotiate with the United Kingdom government settlement of outstanding economic and financial matters including the transferof statal and para-statal property, matters relating to currency and the hand-over of stores, buildings, &amp;c. If agreement is not reached within three months from15th September, 1948, an arbitrator should be appointed by the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations whose decision would be binding on both parties.2. In addition, the decison of the Council of Foreign Ministers should contain provision for certain other outstanding economic and financial matters in accordance with paragraph 19 of Annex XIV of the Treaty of Peace with italy along the following lines : In accepting trusteeship over Italian Somaliland, Italy will undertake toapply in the territory, in so far as appropriate, the provisions of Articles 75, 76,78, 80, 81, 83 and Annex XY of the Treaty of Peace. Pending the cominginto force of a &quot;trusteeship agreement, Italy will undertake to apply in theterritory the provisions of Article 82 of the Treaty of Peace.ANNEX CU.S.S.R.Special opinion of the U.S.S.R. DelegationSince the Council of Foreign Ministers has instructed the Deputies only&quot; to submit their recommendations on the question of defining the ultimate fate of the Italian territorial possessions in Africa,&quot; the Soviet Delegation considersthat the consideration of questions in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the recommenda-tions on Eritrea submitted by the United Kingdom Delegation and in paragraph 3of the Recommendations of the French Delegation do not come within the termsof reference of the Deputies and therefore should not be included in the Recom-mendations to the Council of Foreign Ministers.This in equal measure relates to the text of Annexes A and B submittedjointly by the Delegations of the United Kingdom, United States and France.ANNEX DUnited Kingdom, United States and france the United Kingdom, United States and French Deputies disagree withthe opinion of the Soviet Delegation that certain of the Recommendations madeby these three Delegations do not come within the terms of reference of the deputies (Annex C).It is the task of the Deputies to prepare the ground so far as possible forthe decisions which the Foreign Ministers are required to take by the provisionsof the Peace Treaty. In carrying out this task, the Deputies must clearly be guided by the same considerations as the Ministers themselves. The Ministers,according to the text of Annex XI of the Treaty, must bear in mind the require-ments of peace and security. It is evident that an incomplete or vague settle-ment, or one which left undecided such questions as the method of transfer ofadministration, would not fulfil these requirements. Moreover, Annex XIVcontains a definite requirement that the Ministers should decide the economic andfinancial questions connected with the final disposal of the former Italian Colonies.
ANNEX ERequests by other Interested Governments to Express theirViews to the Council of Foreign ministers in presenting their views on the disposal of the former Italian Colonies theGovernments of Australia and of the Union of South Africa made a definiterequest for an opportunity to present views to the Council of Foreign Ministers.In addition, the following other interested Governments have informed the deputies that they reserve the right to present views direct to the Ministers : Byelorussian S.S.R., New Zealand, Poland, Ukrainian S.S.R. and yugoslavia.The Deputies inform the Ministers of these facts so as to enable them toconsider the question at the appropriate time.
