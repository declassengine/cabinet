THIS DOCUMENT IS THE EBOKBBTg OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT -The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use oL^^^^h^y^!^.....6so&quot;K/TOP SECRET Copy No, 5,1CP.(h&amp;) 206?kt,h August, lays-CABINETgg&amp;PAiL4TI0IIS FOR DEFENCEMemgggndjg by the Prime MinisterDuring -July and August the Defence Committee have held a series of meetings at which they have considered, in the lightof the international situation, the state of preparedness of the armed Forces.      On 30th July the Committee agreed that any stepsto place the Armed Forces in the best possible position to fight in the event of war in the near future, which could be taken without publicity and without serious impact on the economy ofthe country, should be taken forthwith.      The steps already beingtaken are summarised in Annex 1*On 15th August, the Committee agreed that a point hadbeen reached when it was necessary that steps should be taken toplace the Armed forces in a better state of preparedness;    thatit was essential over the next few months that we should be ableto deploy greater armed strength;    that some economic consequences would have to be accepted;    and that, properlypresented, some publicity abo^et the strengthening of our armed forces would be nanohgectionoblea      They accordingly invited theMinister of Defence to prepare a memorandum presenting the general conclusions reached Tory the Committee, setting out the measureswhich should be taken issmeaiately to place the Armed Forces in abetter state of preparedness and showing what would be involvedif these measures were pat into effect.This memorandum was considered by the Committee attheir meeting on 23rd August.      The detailed proposals put beforethem are set out in Annexes II to VI and the recommendations onthese proposals which the Committee now make to the Cabinet arelisted in paragraph h. &quot;below.2.&apos; Our strategy at present is founded on threeprinciples:-(a) The defence of the United Kingdom.(b) The defence of essential sea communications.(c) The defence of the Middle East.3* The responsibilities and tasks that devolve on theServices consequent upon this strategy at the outbreak of war are:-
(a)      Defence of the United KingdomAir defence and defence of thesea approaches and ports(^)      Control of essential seacommunicationsProvision of the naval forces for the control of the north atlantic and Mediterranean sea communications;Employment of the air forces for the defence of these sea communications;Institution of convoys in the atlantic ocean and mediterranean sea;Garrisoning of bases requiredby the Royal Navy and RoyalAir Force.(c)     Middle east defence and development of middle -East base, and re-deployment and reinforcingof existing forces()      Bases for U. s.  Strategic AirForces in U. K.  and Middle BastPreparation and stocking of the airfields in East Anglia, canal zone, Aden and Sudan(e)     Fighting on the ContinentRedeployment on the Rhine ofexisting forces in Europe;Provision of essentialadministrative backing- to our forces on the Rhine.Service ResponsibleAll three ServicesRoyal NavyRoyal Navy and RoyalAir ForceRoyal NavyArmyill three ServicesRoyal Air ForceArray and Royal AirForceArmyk* It has so far been accepted that the risk of a major war is ruled out during the five years from October, 191+7, thatthis risk will increase only gradually during the followingfive years,  and that if attacked in this period we must fightwith what we have,      Present circumstances being what they are,this assumption, which governs the present condition of our forces and which will, if continued in application, make themeven weaker, will have to be reconsidered.      Meanwhile, to put the Services into a better position to fight with what we have,the Committee recommend to the Cabinet that the following measures should be taken.      These measures are necessary toenable the most to be made of our existing resources and to remedy the most serious gaps in our defences.
MAN-POWER(a)      Suspension of Releases (Annex II)102There should, he a general suspension of releases fromthe Armed Forces for a period up to 31st March, 19h9*Implementation- of this decision by the Service Departmentsrequires a few days&apos; notice in order to give Gommanders-in-Chief time to issue the necessary instructions and explanations.Subject to that, the sooner the suspension can be made effective after the public announcement, the less risk thereis,  in the view of the Service Departments,  of serious damage to Service morale.The Cabinet are invited to decide whether thissuspension should operate from 1st September or 1st October.If the earlier dote is chosen the Armed Forces will retainabout 30,000 additional trained men and there will be nodifficulty in allowing tho minimum period of time between theannouncement of the suspension and its being brought intoforce.      On the other hand, it will be necessary to exempt from the suspension men who have secured places in the universities, but who are not due for release until September,and this may lead to complaints of discrimination.      If thedate 1st October is chosen, the Armed Forces will gain less inman-power and it will be difficult to avoid announcing the suspension-as soon as the new Session begins (i.e. on1hth September) with the result that there will be an interval of over a fortnight between the announcement and the bringing into operation of the measure.(&quot;h)     Review.of National Service Act, 19U7.The possibility of adjusting the Notional service act, 19h7,  (e.g. by lengthening the period of service with thecolours)  in order to enable the man-power needs of the armed forces in the next few years to be met more effectively shouldbe considered.      The Minister of Defence is arranging for a working party to consider this question.(c) Selective recall of regular reservists and recall ofspjjcj^ldsts from Class Z reserve (i.e._released wartimeService men)  (Annexes III and IV)These measures would be regarded both at home andabroad as a step towards mobilisation and the Committee recommendthat- they should not be adopted for the present.      The Committeehave asked the Minister of Defence to consider what steps mightbe taken to improve the conditions of service in the armed forces with a view to attracting more regulars.(d) Village Oreen Scheme (Annex IV)This scheme provides for the registration of men with war experience in anti-aircraft units who are willing to serve in local anti-aircraft units in the event of an emergency.The Committee recommend that it should be put into effect atonce by the War Office.      Corresponding schemes to meet theneeds of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force should also bebrought into operation.(e) Recruitment to the Auxiliary Forces  (Annex V)Recruitment for the auxiliary-forces of all three services should be intensified end the campaign should be givenmaximum Ministerial support.      A recruiting campaign for theTerritorial Army will start on 1st October.
(&amp;)      Small Arms Ammunition (Paragraph 6 of Annex VI)The rate of production should be raised over the. nextyear from 200 million rounds to U00 million rounds per annum.(&amp;)     Fighter Aircraft (Paragraphs 7 to 11 of Annex VI)Additional orders for the production of jet fightersover the   next two years should be placed so as to enable asecond shift to be introduced in existing aircraft and aero-engine factories.      The cost of these orders would be about 20 millions and the additional labour required would be about12,000.Steps should also be taken to recondition suitableexisting types of piston-engined fighters and to reopenproduction of spares for these types.(i)      Bomber airfields (Paragraph 1 2 of Annex VI)Up to four additional airfields should be prepared inthe United Kingdom for the use of United States heavy bombers.(d)      Repair and refit of escort vessels (Paragraph 13 of annex vTTIn addition to the work being done in Royal Dockyards,a certain amount of repair and refitting of escort vessels should be entrusted to selected private firms.(k)      Clothing (Paragraph 1h of Annex VI)Orders for 1\ million linear yards of woollen clothand 3i million linear yards of cotton cloth for the armed forces should be placed.(1)      United Kingdom Pipeline (Paragraph 15 to 21 ofAnnox&quot;&quot;viTThe works listed in paragraphs 15 to 21 of Annex VIshould be carried out,  the necessary steel being found fromthe oil companies&apos;  allocation.(m)      Vehicles, General Stores, Respirators and AccommodationTParagraphs 22 to 25 of Annex VIY&quot;The Committee invite the Cabinet to take note of theposition disclosed in these paragraphs.PRODUCTION&apos; ( )     Anti-Aircraft Ammunition (Paragraphs 2 to 5 of annex VlTThe rate of production should be built up as soon aspossible to the following level -5.25&quot; H.E. 10,000 per month.7&quot; Mark IV H.E. 5,000    &quot;        &quot;3.7&quot; Mark III H.E. 30,000    &quot;        &quot;b,5,000
(n)     Oil Stocks (Paragraph 7 of Annex I)The Committee invite the Cabinet to take note thatan assessment of the needs of the Services is being preparedI       urgently with a view to an approach to the United StatesGovernment for assistance.5.       Labour and Scarce Materials Requirements.      Therecommendations made in paragraph 4 necessarily reduce theamount of labour available to civil industry.      The suspension of releases from 1st September, 1948, to 31st March, 1949* wouldmean the retention in the Services of about 170,000 men, 75%to 80% of whom would have gone back to industry, though it isnot possible to say which industries would be affected.     as stated in Annex VI, the additional production of aircraft and ammunition would require about 15*500 men.      There wouldalso be a temporary requirement of labour in the clothingIndustry   in connection with the proposal at paragraph 4(k)above.Apart from the work on the pipe-line and the repair andrefit of naval vessels, the measures recommended involve less than20,000 tons of steel a quarter, and this could probably be met by asmall cut applied uniformly to all allocation holders.     for periods III and IV of 1948 all steel expected to be availablehas already been allocated,  so that over-allocation would be involved,  and it is impossible to say which holders ofallocations would, in fact,  suffer.6.       Publicity.      The Cabinet will require to consider the formand timing of any announcements about the measures recommended in paragraph 4 above, bearing in mind their probable effect onthe conversations now in progress in Moscow and the fact that when parliament meets on 14th September Ministers will undoubtedlyhove to face questions on the subject of defence preparations.Following are the main public announcements which would flow from the recommendations:-(a)    Suspension of Releases.      A statement that releases from the Armed Forces are to be suspended from 1st September or 1st October.      If the earlier date is chosen this statement would have to be made not later than 31st August.      If the later date ischosen, it might be difficult to postpone thestatement beyond 14th September when the new Sessionbegins.      (See paragraph 4(a) above).(b)    Village Green Scheme.      This would involve an appealto men to register.      The best date for the launching of the appeal would be that on which the decision to suspend releases is announced.(c)   Intensification of Recruitment for the Auxiliary Forces(d)    Production.      No formal announcement of the decisions to increase the production of ammunition and fighter aircraft, to prepare additional airfields,  to entrust the repair and refit of escort vessels to private-firms, to give additional orders for cloth^for the armed Forces, and to restore the United Kingdompipeline will be needed.     But the fact that these measures are being taken will undoubtedly become
known and it would probably be undesirable that information about them should reach the publicpiecemeal.In view of what is said in (d)  the Cabinet may consider it desirable that a comprehensive statement shouldbe made covering all the measures that are being taken.      Ifit should be decided to suspend releases from 1st September?the statement would probably have to be made concurrently withthe announcement of this decision (i.e. not later than31st August).      If, however, the suspension of releases is brought into force on 1st October, the statement could bemode in Parliament shortly after the new Session begins.The statement should in any event contain some reference towhat is being done in the field of civil defence.C.R.A.10, Downing Street, S.W.1.21+th August,  1948.
ANNEX IDecisions1* Under previous decisions of the Defence committee or Staff Conference, the following measures, which involve no publicity and have little or no effect on the national economy, are already being taken:(l) High priority is being given for labour and materials for the repair of equipment.(2) The G.P.O. is giving priority to restoration and establishment of operational channels.(3) Immediate steps arc being taken to plan the frame-work of a Civil Defence Organisation in sufficient strength on a pLGgion/Army H.Q. level.(h) An Allied Command Organisation in Europe is being planned.(5) The military supply position (including oil) isbeing investigated, with a view to an approach to the Americans.2*     Measures now in hand the measures already taken have in general been restricted to the preparation and perfection of plans andthe re-distribution, overhaul and repair of existing stores and equipment.    For those purposes, additional civilianlabour for work at Service and Supply establishments isbeing recruited in small pockets distributed widely through-out the country.    The additional labour will ultimatelyamount to some 25,000. men and women, but it will be several weeks before this figure is reached.    The Ministry of labour are assisting in the recruitment of the additional labour required and Service and Supply Department applications for labour will be given first attention in areas where there is serious competition for labour.   Where this will seriously affect recruitment arrangements already in hand or contem-plated for other preference vacancies, particularly thoseaffecting export, no action is being taken without special consideration.    Periodical reports are being made on theprogress of this additional recruitment so that any likelihood-hood of a substantial excess over the estimate of 25,000or undue interference with other preference vacancies can bebrought to the notice of Ministers.3. In. general, though some diversion of labour from civil works will occur, its total effect on the national economy will not be serious.    There will also be smalldemands    on scarce materials, e.g.,  steel, but not enoughto have a noticeable effect on the national economy.4. Within the above limits a very small start is being-made on such matters as:-(a)   Mobilization preparations.
Ob)    Inspection and overhaul of air defence radar.(With the raising of the ban on publicity more.wiil be possible under this head).(c) Inspection,  overhaul and repair of vehicles,stores and equipment generally.(d) Pilling of 100,000 rounds of 3.7&quot; A.A. ammunition.(e) Re-fits of small craft and escort vessels.(f)&apos; Slight acceleration of orders for fighter aircraftnow in production.(g) Preliminary steps in connection with the seawarddefences of ports and bases.(h) Commencement of preparation of static warcommunications.(i) Commencement of the stocking of airfields.5.     C oriimun ica t i ons .In conjunction with the Service Departments theG.P.O. are helping as unobtrusively and rapidly as possibleto restore essential operational communications including those for U.K. air,  ground and civil defence, base depots,and ports.6.     Allied Command Organisation.The Chiefs of Staff,  in conjunction wi th the western union Five Power Military Committee, are recommending to ameeting of the Western Union Ministers of Defence on1st September the immediate establishment of an organisation in Europe.    This organisation will co-ordinate the plans for action in Europe in an emergency of all the Allies, includingif possible American participation.7.     Supplies.The Chiefs of Staff intend to discuss the militarysupply position with the Americans at a Combined Chiefsof&quot;Staff meeting, if this can be arranged.    On fuel stocks,the Foreign Secretary was asked in C.M.(l4-8) hoth ConclusionsItem 6(3), In conjunction with the Chancellor of theExcheauer and the Ministers of Defence and Fuel and Power,to seek the assistance of the U.S.A. to build up fuelstocks in the U.K.   To this end, a Working Party is atpresent assessing the requirements of all three Services,and the necessary data will be available for considerationby Ministers in the near future.
mImSES. IITotal       . ... 8-1 it,000h.     The planned manpower levels to which the Forces would normally hove been run down&apos;.&quot;by 31st March, 19h9j were approximately as follows:-Royal Navy          ... lh-5,000Army                    ... 372,000R.A.F.                  ... 225,000  -7h3,000(The Army figure allows for an over-bearing of 27,000 over theactual target figure approved by the Cabinet for.31st march next;    the Defence Committee&apos;s approval for this over-bearing,which is necessary to meet, the unavoidable overseas commitments of the Army which have not run down as rapidly as was expected,notably in Austria, Trieste and the Middle East, has not yetbeen.sought owing to the developments in recent weeks).5.      If all releases from the Forces (except of individuals onurgent compassionate grounds) were-suspended as from 1st September, lyAS, the resulting strengths of the three services would be approximately as follows:-1st january  19h9Royal Navy       ... 150,500Army ... 460,000R.A.F. ... 25h,OO0Total 854,5001 .      Stop further releases from all Services.Moasuros that can bo put in hand2.     The general effect of this decision would be to allow the forces to retain some of the hard core of experiencedand technically trained men.      Throughout all three Servicessome of these man could be employed on overall and repair of front line and reserve equipment.    Fighting units would gain greatly in efficiency through retention ofN.O.O&apos;s and specialists.     It is the first essential step forthe Army.Should war break out, or its threat, become imminent, atany time during the next six to nine months, fairly extensiveplans have already been prepared - and are being perfectedevery week - for a &quot;crash mobilisation&quot;.Man-P owo r C ons e ouonee s3.      The uniformed strength of the three Services on 1stAugust,. 1 9h8 , was approximately as follows :-Royal Navy ... 1L2,000Army ... h.59,000R.A.F. ... 233,000
1st April, 19k9Royal Navy .... 156,500Army ---- U91 ,000R.A.F. ---- 266,000915,500This total suspension of releases would retain with theForces some personnel not strictly required to make gooddeficiencies in trades, etc.., but the Service Departmentshold that the measure of differentiation involved in allowing such personnel to be released at their due dateswould be damaging to the morale of the men retained andis therefore undesirable..&quot;transitional years&quot; 1 9h7 and full two years stated as their6.     No lesser suspension of releases would have muchpractical effect in strengthening the Forces where theymost need reinforcing as regards personnel.     A partialsuspension could, nevertheless, be implemented on thefollowing principles.      The Government pledge (Cmd.6831 para.6)that all men serving in the Forces at 31st December, 1 9b6 , willbe released before the end of 1 9h8 9 would be observed;    at thesame time men called up in the19h8 would be held to serve thinormal liability in Cmd.,6831 , para. 5.      It will be-recalled that the 11 shading-off&quot; of the two years period of service isdue to begin? as announced by the Minister of Labour last december, with the July, 1 Shi intake of national servicemen,due for release in July, 19h9;    hut in the release programme for the last quarter of 19h8 published last June, the army had stated their intention of beginning this &quot;shading-off&quot;process in November, 19h85 when the January, 19h7 intakewould be released;    to this last-mentioned extent retentionof such men for two years&apos;  service would mean going backon the release programme so far as the Army is concerned,though   not on the original intention published in Cmd,.6831 .The strength of the Forces at 1st April, 19h9 on this assumption of retention for two years service would be -Royal Navy11+5.000ArmyhOO,000R.A.F.226 ,000Total771,000Economic Consequences7. The total suspension of releasessome  15 million to Service Estimatesaccount of pay and maintenance, etc.,as above would addin the current year onalone.      It would alsowithhold from civil life, and from industry, appreciablenumbers of men who would otherwise have reinforced theindustrial, economy of the country, the exnort drive, etc.At a very rough estimate,  some fifty per cent,  of the extranumbers retained witn the colours, compared with the
manpower target for 1st April, 1 9h9 s mentioned above, would represent a withdrawal from industrial manpower.     Inspite of the effect on the civil economy of a total suspensioof releases from the Forces, it seems probable that publiaopinion would expect that step to be taken before there were any large-scale recall of Glass Z Reservists from civil life.Publicity Inyolvod8.     A Ministerial announcement would be needed.
ANNEX III &apos; ^Economic Consequences.6.        Of some 26,000 men to be recalled the bulk would be inemployment and about one half would be skilled men.      It -wouldnecessary to guarantee appropriate reinstatement rights.-Publicity.7.        This decision would have a more serious domestic and international effect than stopping release.      It is one of theessential pre-mobilisation stops and would he recognised assuch.1,       Selective recall of regular reservists.Measures that can do put in hand2.       This decision, taken in conjunction with stopping releases,would enable the Services to proceed with the following measures:1.      Overhaul A/A, Radar and communication equipment.2. Accelerate refits and overhauls of ships, andparticularly minesweeper units in the reservefleet.3.      Make initial preparations for the seaward defencesof ports and bases.h.      Stock up bases.5.      Deploy Heavy A/A Equipment.6.      Overhaul and repair other.&quot; war-like stores,e.g. A.P.V.&apos;s, Artillery and vehicles.Manpower Consequences.3.        Out of a present total of approximately 16,000 Royal FleetReserve personnel and 20,000 Naval pensioners, R&apos;jyal navy would wish to recall some 5*000, comprising mainly seamen, stokers,communications personnel, and electrical personnel for manningunits of the Reserve Fleet and for making good&apos; arrears of maintenance jalso included would bo certoin naval aviation ratings.a.       The regular reserves of the Army comprise at present 3,000officers    and 50,000 other.ranks.    From those the main need is to recall tradesmen and specialists for Anti aircraft Command, andto help to make Middle East and B.A.O.R. up to peace estahlisliment.The main categories would be A.A. Artillery, Royal Signals, R.A. 0.C,R.A.S.C., R.E.M.E.  and R.A.M.C.   and would total about 20,000.    Sofar as the worst deficit is concerned, namely, A.A. Command, thesereservists would be employed for the most part on repairing A..-.,guns and equipment and on communications, though as a secondarytask some 4,000 men would be available for manning this equipment.5.       The R.A.F. regular reserves are, for various reasons, onlynov; heginning to build up, and number only about 1,500,    The AirForce at present must rely in emergency on its war-trained personnelnow in civil life; .   but it would desire to have a selective callback of its regular reservists,  although the numbers involved are so small that they will bring no appreciable improvement.
ANNEX IVBeclsi-QB Required1.       BsaplemeiLt &quot;Village Green&quot; Scheme;    recall specialistsfVcjia Glass Z Reserve.Mgasgges that can be &quot;out in hand2.        Tills decision is required for A/A Command to provide andman the HnLnimuim scale of ground defences in the more vulnerabledistricts of the U.K.;    and for strengthening Fighter CommandControl tm&amp; Reporting system.Manpower Consequences&quot;&quot;&quot;Village Green&quot; Scheme and Recall of Class Z (War-trained)Eesenv/ists3.       &quot;The Village Green Scheme contemplates the voluntary regis-tration, for service with local units,  of some 60,000 men releasedafter wartime service in A.A. units.       While registration wouldbe carried through locally, e.g. by T.A.  and A.F. associations and local A.A. units, to ensure success the scheme would needconsiderable publicity and overt and emphatic Government endorse-meni.     On these assumptions, it might be expected to produceappreciable results within,  say, six weeks to three months.ii.        If A.A. Command is likely to be required to provide and manthe mi7mim-m. scale of ground defences in the more vulnerabledistricts of the U.K. within the next few months,  there are only two aethods of finding the necessary personnel.        The first isthe Village Green Scheme, which as stated above will require afew months to produce results.      The second is the recall, upto the required numbers and in the necessary categories, of similar personnel trained in A.A. duties during the War:      this latter is of course a measure which could be initiated at anytime,       if the economic ana publicity consequences could be &quot;accepted;and It is, In fact, an important part, of the &quot;crash mobilisation&quot;plan,5.       The Royal Navy,  if the principle of a Village Green schemeis -adopted for- certain Army purposes, would wish to apply thesame principle to the extent of registering a certain number ofGlass s Reservists for emergency call-up, though without theliiuatatloa of -Local employment.6.        Tfee comparable problem in the H.A.F.  is that of manning thecontrol and reporting system, without which no air defence planscan fnnction..     The intention is that&apos;the system should be mannedto a great extent by the Royal Auxiliary air Force;   but untilthe S.AUX.A.F. recruits appreciable numbers,  there will be no option in an emergency but to recall some 6,h00 selected Class ZReservists of the right specialised experience.      These personnelmast be actually at their posts when an emergency is declared.Additional reservists will also be required for the urgent overhaulof radar equipment for use in the control and reporting system.Economic Consequences7.       until an emergency is imminent, involving an actual call upof personnel, the measures referred to above would have noeeonoiaic consequences.
8.       The success of the Village Green scheme depends on theattendant publicity drive &quot;which must he vigorously prosecutedto produce early results.       The intensified recruiting campaign for the S.A. must not he allowed to affect the Village Greenscheme, which will still he required until the T.A.  is filled toe s tahlishsaent.
ANNEX VDecision Required1. Intensify recruiting for Auxiliary Forces of thethree Services.Auxiliary forces. The Auxiliary Forces,  comprising the R.N.V.R., R.N.R.and R.M.F.V.R., the Territorial Army, tho R.Aux. A.F. andthe R.A.F.V.R., are only in the early stages of theirpost-war building up,  though the Territorial Army has gotfurther with this process than the other Forces.3. The R.N.V.R., now numbering under 3,000, will as itexpands be available largely in reduction of the Class ZReservists it would otherwise be necessary to recall from civil life in emergency.    The Territorial Army has been referred to under the preceding heading;    it aims, betweenOctober and March next, to recruit its present 50,000 up to150,000, about one-third of which will be ;]./v.  personnel.It is most important that this recruiting campaign snould achieve its target, not only because of the need to have the T/a ready to receive the first national service reservists underthe 1947 Act   by 1st January I950, but - in the light ofrecent developments - to be available as a general reserve of mainly war-trained men in emergency.    The R. Aux.A.F.and R.A.F.V.R. number at present only h5h-00j    it is very necessary that recruiting of these two Forces should be intensified;    for example,  the manning of Air Defence Unitsfalls mainly upon the R.Aux. A.F.h* The Auxiliary Forces of all three Services will tosome extent share in the recruiting campaign for theTerritorial Army which is planned to be in full, swing by october, but it seems necessary that recruiting for the auxiliary Forces of the Navy and Air Force should be intensified equally with that of the T/A,  since every manrecruited to the Auxiliary Forces means one man lessrecalled from Glass Z in emergency.Economic Conse quenc e s5. There will be no economic consequences.Publicity Involved6. To ensure success an intensive publicity drive, withmaximum Ministerial support, will bo necessary.
ANNEX VIh.      The above is the minimum reasonable scale of productionincluding the present token rates of h,000 a month.      Itwould take about 8 months to build up and would requireextra labour and materials as follows:-SteelCopperBrassLabour    500 Newcastle )  recruited over150 Cardiff     ) 6 months.5.      The filling of the ammunition with production on this scale would involve no demands for additional labour atCharley or G-lascoed.      The labour needed at Newcastle andCardiff v/ould present no special difficulty..303&quot; S.A.A.6.      In the event of war, substantial stocks of small arms ammunition would be essential.      Production plans are in handon the basis of building up to 200 million rounds per annumto meet large foreign orders.     This could be increased tohOO million rounds per annum with no extra materials in.thefirst year, but with an additional labour force of 600 atRadway Green,  1,000 at Birmingham, 500 at Leeds and b-00 at woolwich.     At Radway Green the labour demand would compete with the Potteries, whose exports are important and themselves need more labour.     Directions would probably not be required on any scale since the R.O.P. work is morepopular than pottery.      These numbers could probably bereached without special measures other than preference,though at Leeds there might be some small adverse affecton the woollen industry.*880 )23 ) Tons per month from35b ; the decision to increase ,     Authorise additional production required to remedy-important deficiencies.A.A. Ammunition2.     Apart from filling 100,000 rounds of 3.7 Mark IIIammunition, the War Office.requirements of b&amp; millions of5.25 and 3.7 A.A. Ammunition could only he met by new production on a very large scale equivalent to a war basis.It would require a peak rate of production of 168S000 per month to complete the programme in three years.     Such a programme including packages would involve 150,000 tons ofsteel, 6,000 tons of copper,  62,000 tons of brass,  13,000standards of softwood, and 50,000 cubic feet of hardwood:and in total a peak labour force of about 20,000.3,     A practical rate of production using existing plant and allowing for certain technical limitations which would bedifficult to overcome under peace conditions would be tobuild up by types as follows:-5.25&quot; H.E.      &quot; 10,000 per month   -3.7&quot;    Mark IV H.E. 5,000    &quot;        &quot;3.7&quot;    Mark III H.E. 30,000    &quot;        &quot;h5,000
Increased Production of Fighter Aircraft (R.N. and R.A.F.)7.   . A small increase in the deliveries of jet fighter aircraft and spares is expected during tho next threemonths from the steps now &quot;being taken to accelerateproduction by means of overtime, etc.     For any substantial increase in production it will be necessary:(a) To introduce a second shift in theexisting aircraft and aero-engine factories:and/or(b) To start up additional factories!(a) would achieve quicker results than (b).     Evenassuming that additional factory space could be madeavailable, the work of opening up new production lines andthe manufacture of new sets of jigs and tools would take time and no additional deliveries therefrom could beexpected in less than 18 months.8.     Close estimates of what (a) would involve are impossible in the short time available.      The factories concerned areat Gloucester, Preston, Derby, Edgware and Watford and,  inaddition, increased output would he required from thefabricators of materials and from a number of sub-contractors and equipment manufacturers throughout the country.9.     To secure results under (a) it would be necessary toarrange now for production at the increased capacity for about two&apos; years.     Substantial extra orders would have to beplaced, probably for about 1+00 to 500 each of Vampires andMeteors.      The ultimate cost of these aeroplanes would be ofthe order of  20,000,000.     From a production point of view it would be possible to place orders of this magnitude forVampires only or for Meteors only but it would not be worthwhile placing smaller orders for both types.     The totaladditional labour force necessary for the extra production would be about 12,000.      Increased deliveries would start in about six months.      At the present time production ofVampires is at the rate of approximately 20 aeroplanes per month and of Meteors at the rate of about 25 planes permcnth.      This production is already planned to be increasedto 37 Vampires in 18 months&apos;  time and 30 Meteors in sixmonths&apos;  time.      The extra production resulting from a double shift would increase the output to 56 Vampires andh5 Meteors per month, in 18 months&apos;  time.10.    The demand on &quot;difficult&quot; materials would be smallhut the labour problem would be more serious.     An increaseof 3,000 might be involved at Gloucester hut in practice this could he reduced to say 1,000 by extensive sub-contracting.Drastic cuts in other production would be essential and direction would probably be necessary.      The otherproduction affected would probably he agricultural engineering,ball bearings,  textile spindles and scientific instruments.A complete shut down of the production of aluminium houses atHawksley&apos;s,     a factory next to Gloucester Aircraft,employing 3,000 workers, might he the best solution.     AtPreston, on an assumed figure of about 2,o00 workers, i.e,double the staff on aircraft work at English Electric,  the&quot;best way to&apos; obtain the labour would probably be to cut outthe production of all domestic appliances now absorbing1,300 workers.      The remaining 1,200 could probably he obtained
from Lass essorrti-al production, not cotton, thoughdirection might he necessary.     At Edgware a labour force    117of 500-6CO might he required,      This could probably be 4,8obtained by an internal switch cutting down civilianproduction.     To the extent to which additional labour wasnecessary it could probably be found locally withoutdirection being necessary.     The details&apos; are notavailable of the labour needed at Derby and Wr^+^n-rcl but itcould probably be obtained by on internal switch coupled withsome outside recruitment.11,      In the event of an early emergency, considerablereliance would have to he placed on existing types ofpiston-engined aircraft, eeg&apos;., Spitfires, which exist insome quantity.      These aircraft are at present in store andare in varying stages of operational readiness.     They arenot supported by a balanced range of spares.     Steps shouldbe taken (i)  to recondition the aircraft and (ii)  tore-open production of spares as necessary.     The work under(i) would have largely to be done by industry, but there isat present certain available capacity.     Some increase in labour would be necessary.     The work should however he putin hand to the maximum extent possible within existing     -capacity.     The supply of jigs and tools for themanufacture of spares is being investigated.Proposition of Berber airfields-12.    oxily six airfields in this country are at presentsuitable for   American bombers and two of these are in civilianownership.      It would be possible to put in hand forth with the preparation of another four airfields which have the required runway length provided the locations are suitableThe work could be completed within three or four months.It would cost in all some  580,COO, would need some 1+00 men,some 185,000 tons of stone, 7,000 tons of tar and 5,800tons of bitumen.     The implementation of a long-term plan for the preparation of other airfields would involve insome cases land purchases and road diversions.     There wouldbe a substantial demand for cement and stone and large numbersof unskilled men would be required.Repair ana Rofit of aTu-;^! VobboIb13*       Apart from the acceleration of repairs and refits ofescort vessels in the Royal Dockyards,  selected private firms are being approached to do a proportion of this work without interference with the civilian economy.    The effecton merchant ship-building and repair of refitting H.M.  ships in private yards naturally depends on the amount of workpxaced in this way;    it may in fact be necessary for some slight interference to take place though this would be verysmall spread over the private capacity of the country, and every core would be taken in each case to ensure thatcontracts interfered as little as possible with civil work.An additional allocation of steel of 5,000 tonshas already been asked for from the Materials Committee.Clothingl4*       The Services do not hold adequate reserves of clothing and would not,  therefore, be able both to clothe all newlymobilised forces and to meet their maintenance requirements.In September 1939 the position was much better than it isnow, as the rate of production increased in the Spring ofthat year as a consequence of the doubling of the&quot;Territorial Army and the passing of the Militia Act.   Tosecure increased production of complete clothing by April -August, 19U9, immediate orders for material should be placednow,  since it takes 12 months from the date of orderingfor all the production processes to be completed.    Iforders were placed in the very near future for about 1-g million
linear yards of woollen cloth and ^i- million linear yards ofcotton cloth (not drill) it would he possible, after allowing forthe uso of exiBoxng stocks of materials, to provideessential items for some 300,000 men within the next15 months.     The effect of this would ho to impose on additional strain on supplies to the home or export markets of men&apos;s wear,.where the need is already greatest.     the woollen cloth.production required represents one per cent of the annual supplies to the home market, or 2-g- per cent of supplies &quot;of men&apos;s cloth.     According to composition itwould represent from  1 m.to  3 m. of exports.     Serviceorders arc unattractive to the textile industries and new production on the necessary scale, would not be secured without strong pressure, which would inevitably involvepublicity.Restoration of the U.K. Pipeline Systems15.     The main network of pipeline, constructed during thewar, has been on a care and maintenance basis except for two sections which have been in use commercially.     A survey of the pipeline system is already in progress and will bocompleted in about six weeks.16.      Several wartime installations for unloading tankersinto the system -at&apos; Avonmouth and Bromborough and manybranch lines to-airfields have been removed.      It isnecessary to restore some of these facilities immediately and to take steps to allow prompt restoration of otherswhen required.17.     Steps required now at unloading stations are:-(1) At Avonmouth.    The earmarking, from new production,of eleven pipelines, each 3,600 feet long at thejetty, and the relaying from available stocks of several short lengths of pipeline inside the dock area.(2) At Bromborough.    The earmarking for thereconstruction of the second mooring of twopipelines each half a mile long which would call for new production costing  2-3000:  theAdmiralty would also be requested to hold themoorings and ancillary gear in readiness.18.      The linking of airfields requires further investigation, which the Air Ministry are actively pursuing:it seems as if some 120 miles of pipeline (new production) might be involved.19.     Operation of the pipeline system would require 230 more,men on an average wage of  6 or  7 a week.20.      The Admiralty system at Loch Long must be placed in astate of readiness and requires:-at Pinnart;(1) The reconstruction of tankage and the pumphousoat a cost of  60,000, and the renovation of thejetty at a cost of  10,000.
(2) The relaying-of 21+00 feet of pipeline.The work would require 200 men for a year.About 50% of the material is available:provision of two 5000 ton and two 8000 tontanks from new production, would be the main&apos; demand.,at Bowling:The reconstruction of the pumphouse whichwould not involve much work.21.      The various works on the pipeline would require1 ,000 tons of steel for re-placements and h,000 tons forthe linking of airfields.     This steel would probably have to be provided by the diversion of pipes from the oil industry, who are the major consumers of the presentoutput of 60,000 tons a.quarter.Vehicles22,      As regards vehicles, an immediate and limitedimprovement in the position can be made by acceleratingthe overhaul of existing stocks, and measures are in hand.The Rebuild programme is a long-term measure and even ifaccelerated, it- will not affect the present situation.The only measure that can lie effective for units requiredafter essential formations have been equipped isdiversion from current production.General Stores23.      There is a very serious shortage of many items of navalstores including naval/air stores, and of stores for civil use,such as crockery,  cutlery, etc.,  ana though a little-could be dono over a small range to meet some of these requirements, most of them could only be met by a diversion of supplies from the export and homo markets.Respirators21+.      The Service requirements of respirators may be very substantial.      The problem is being explored by theMinistry of Supply and the Service Departments.Accommodation25,      Cement,  timber,  corrugated iron, piping and otherconstructional materials, as well as furniture, arerequired to enable disused accommodation to be put into service again and to provide certain essential facilitiesfor troops under canvas.      The War Office and the AirMinistry,  in consultation with the Civil Departmentsconcerned, arc investigating the present state of thisaccommodation and the quantities of materials required.
These are likely to be substantial.      For instance,a first estimate of War Office needs alone indicatesrequirements of about 1+0,000 tons of cement and about 2,000 tons of corrugated iron, together withquite substantial quantities of other materialssuch as timber and drain pipes..
