DRAFT PROROGATION SPEECH, 1947-48 SESSIONMonday, 13th September, 1948My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :1. During the Session which is now ending economic difficulties have gravelydelayed the recovery of all the countries of the eastern hemisphere. Throughthe sustained energies of My people in achieving a great and continuing expansionof exports and their resolute acceptance of a prolonged period of inevitabledifficulty, progress has been made in redressing the adverse balance of payments.But world circumstances including a persistent rise in the price of manycommodities essential to our economy have proved unfavourable, and further effort and sacrifice will be needed if the problem is to be surmounted. A greatcontribution towards lessening our dependence on imports has been made by our agricultural industry, all sections of which have responded to the call forincreased production. In the face of world shortages My Ministers havevigorously sought both to establish new sources of supply of foodstuffs and tosafeguard the future by &quot;entering into long-term agreements with overseas countries.2. The way before us is still hard, and it is only with courage and endurance,and by intensifying our present efforts, that we can, under God, overcome our difficulties and attain to that degree of prosperity and well-being for whichwe all hope.3. In these anxious times we have all been encouraged by the far-sighted andgenerous action of the United States of America in extending financial assistanceto the United Kingdom and other European countries. It is the policy of my government to work with the Government of the United States and with other european Governments to bring about the fullest possible measure of european recovery by the wise use both of our own resources and of the aid afforded us.To this end they have entered into the Convention for European economic co-operation, and have signed the Economic Co-operation Agreement with theUnited States.4. Close links have been forged with our neighbours in Western Europe. ATreaty of Economic, Social and Cultural Collaboration and Collective Self-Def ence has been signed with the Governments of Belgium, France, Luxembourgand the Netherlands; permanent machinery for the co-ordination of defence withthose countries has been established; and satisfactory progress is being madewith the other matters dealt with in the Treaty. It is My prayer that out ofthese hopeful beginnings there will develop an increasing degree of union between all the countries of Western Europe; and. that ultimately, in furtherance of the aims of the United Nations, they may, with their common heritage of culture and freedom, constitute an area of peace, prosperity and ordered progress, in association with the peoples of My Commonwealth overseas and with the UnitedStates of America.5. My Government, together with the United States and French governments and in co-operation with the heads of the Governments of the Western GermanStates, have taken political, economic and financial measures to enable western germany to play her part in the community of European nations. My Govern-ment are still doing their utmost to reach agreement with the Soviet Union onfundamental problems affecting Germany as a whole.6. My beloved daughter, Princess Elizabeth, together with the Duke of edinburgh, paid an official visit to the French Eepublic in May. The affectionatereception which they were accorded formed a heartening demonstration of our good relations with our nearest Continental neighbour.7. I have been happy to welcome to the United Kingdom the Prime Ministerof Australia. My Ministers in the United Kingdom greatly valued this oppor-tunity of personal discussions with him. These have already led to economic arrangements of advantage to both countries, and I have learned with pleasureof the gift which My Government in Australia have made to My Governmentin the United Kingdom.
8. I am gratified that arrangements have been made for a general meetingof My Prime Ministers to be held in London in October.9. A comprehensive trade agreement between the United Kingdom and Eirehas recently been signed. This agreement will, I am confident, prove to be ofbenefit to both countries, and will further contribute to the growth of friendly relations between them.10. My Government in the United Kingdom have concluded mutuallysatisfactory agreements on financial matters with My Governments in India and pakistan.11. During the past year, Ceylon has become a fully self-governing Memberof the Commonwealth. I wish her people all happiness and prosperity and I trust that her relations with the other nations of the Commonwealth will be close and cordial.12. My Government have continued to press ahead with the economic development of the Colonial territories, in order to provide a firm foundation for the social and political advancement of My Colonial peoples and to increasethe world supply of essential foodstuffs and raw materials.13. I have given assent to Constitutional Instruments designed to facilitate the operation of essential common services in the East African territories.14. The new Federation of Malaya has been inaugurated and the newLegislative Council of the Colony of Singapore has met. My Ministers are determined to restore law and order in these territories and to suppress theoutbreaks of violence which have so unhappily disturbed the peace of theFederation; and to that end the police forces nave been greatly strengthenedand military reinforcements have been sent to Malaya.15. I note with satisfaction the measures taken by the Governor-Generalof the Sudan to set up in that territory an Executive Council and an electedLegislative Assembly as a first step towards self-government, and I regret thatthe Egyptian Government have so far felt unable to join in assisting this advance.16. In accordance with plans announced some months earlier My Governmentrelinquished the Mandate for Palestine on 15th May. At the same time theAssembly of the United Nations adopted a resolution setting up a United NationsMediator for Palestine, thus putting into effect a suggestion made by the UnitedKingdom representative. I deeply regret the loss of life caused by hostilitieswhich broke out between the Arabs and Jews in Palestine. These hostilitieshave been brought to an end by the energetic action of the Mediator based ontruce resolutions adopted by the Security Council. The last British forces havenow been withdrawn from Palestine.17. Our gratitude is due to the services rendered for so many years by theBritish civil administration in Palestine, by members of the Palestine police force and by the British Armed Forces who have served there. Amid condi-tions of great difficulty and danger they have discharged their tasks with animpartiality, forbearance and skill deserving of the highest praise.18. I have given My assent to the Burma Independence Act, by which Burmabecame an independent State on 4th January, 1948. The Treaty previouslyconcluded between My Government and the Provisional Government of Burmawas ratified on the same date. I wish well to the Government and people of burma.19. My Government have become parties to the Protocol of ProvisionalApplication of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. They have alsotaken part in Conferences at Geneva and Havana to draw up the draft charter of the International Trade Organisation and have signed the Final Act of theHavana Conference.Members of the House of Commons :20. I thank you for the provision which you have made for the public services and for My beloved daughter, Princess Elizabeth, and her husband.
My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :21. My Forces have continued honourably to discharge the tasks assigned to them throughout the world.22. I have assented to legislation under which women may be enlisted andcommissioned in the Army and the Royal Air Force, and this, with the continuanceof the Women&apos;s Services of the Royal Navy in their existing form, will enablewomen to maintain their high tradition of service with My Forces.23. My Ministers are anxious to ensure the fullest possible growth of goodindustrial relations, on which efficiency in industry and the necessary increase in production so largely depend. To this end they have encouraged the extensionof joint consultation between management and workers at all levels.24. Acts have been passed to abolish the Poor Law and establish arrange-ments for assistance to all in need, and to make improved provision for childrendeprived of a normal home life. Thus has been discharged the great task, whichit has fallen to this Parliament to undertake, of giving legislative effect to a comprehensive scheme of social security. That scheme, which has now beenbrought into operation, will promote the health and well-being of My people,provide a substantial resource in any periods of unavoidable unemployment, andrelieve those anxieties which in the past so often attended sickness, disabilityor old age.25. Steps have been taken to improve the facilities for the consideration of scottish affairs by the establishment of a Scottish Economic Conference and by providing for the greater use of the Standing Committee of the House of commons on Scottish Bills.26.
