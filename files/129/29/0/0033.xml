FRANCE(1) Under the stress of war conditions the Communist Party was outlawedon 26th September, 1939, by the Daladier Government, which ordered its dissolution-tionrr-with the concurrence of the other groups. represented in the Chambre desDeputes.. At the same time the Government placed a ban.on the publication and distribution of all Communist propaganda material. But, by a communicationpublished in the clandestine press of 10th February, 1943, General de Gaulle,in the name of the Free French, accepted the collaboration of the communists in the resistance, and on 25th June, 1943, the Committee of Liberation in Algiersformally rescinded the Daladier decree. Since Liberation, then, France&apos;sCommunist Party has been legal. It is, in fact, the largest single party in the elected Chamber, the Assemblee Nationale (Lower House), and therefore it is unlikely that, short of a war with Russia or a near catastrophic situationleading to a dissolution and a de Gaulle &apos;&apos; dictatorship &apos;&apos; the legality of theParty will be questioned.(2) Membership of the Party. Figures of the actual membership of theParty, as distinct from the Communist-controlled C.G.T., are not easily available.At the end of 1946, according to the official Report of the 11th National congress of the P.C.F. (June, 1947), the strength was 819,155. It is unlikely that thefigure of militants to-day (the middle of 1948) exceeds this. There are, of course,several welfare and charitable organisations of a &quot;fellow-traveller&quot; charactercontrolled by Communists, and a small section of the Socialist Party,&quot; theMouvement Socialiste Unitaire et Democratique (M.S.U.D.) might in certaincircumstances co-operate actively with the P.C.F. (Parti Communiste&apos;Franqais).The Communist Party is strongest in Paris and the Seine Department (inDecember 1946 the membership of the Paris Region was over 100,000). Generallyspeaking membership is well distributed, being weakest in Brittany and Alsace.(3) Percentage of Total Population just over 2 per cent.(Population figure is 40,817,933 the 1946 census.)(4) Percentage of the Electorate. 28-2 per cent, (see 7 infra).(5) Number of Members in the Assemblee Nationale is 183 (out of 619).(6) There were no Communist members in the Schumann Government.Communist Ministers were bowed out of the quadripartite coalition Governmentof M. Ramadier in May 1947, when Communist Deputies, including the Ministers,chose to vote against the Government on economic policy and also on theGovernments policy in Indo-China.(7) Voting strength in the general election of November 1946 was 5,475,955(Metropolitan France only). Overall results of the municipal elections of October1947 gave the Communists no more than 6-9 per cent, of the seats. The finalresult reduced the number of Communist councillors by nearly 25 per cent., andthe party lost a majority of the mairies which they had previously held.(8) Influence in the Armed Forces.&apos; In the first two and a half years afterthe Liberation the Communists exerted considerable influence in the armed forces.This was due partly to the prominent position they had acquired during the resistance period, partly to the strong position they occupied then in the political system. It has to be borne in mind that in the coalition Governments to which France appeared to be committed indefinitely by the electoral law Ministriesare largely party strongholds. General de Gaulle&apos;s coalition Governments, theGouin and Bidault Administrations of 1946, as well as the quadripartite coalition,after the general elections of November 1946, all contained Communist Ministersthrough whose influence Communists were infiltrated into key-positions.M. Tillon, Minister of Armaments, was able to secure control over the arsenals.But the extrusion of Communist Ministers from the Ramadier Government inMay 1947, put a very different complexion on the matter. To-day, while Com-munist agents are perhaps more active than ever the Central Committee ofthe party is known to attach great importance to propaganda in the forces, whichis under the charge of M. Raoul Calas Communist influence in the armed forces,army, navy or air force, has been reduced to negligible proportions. Accordingto a Deuxnieme Bureau estimate in February 1948, not more than 5 per cent, ofofficers in the army are Communist and among naval officers Communist strength is negligible; it is calculated that the air force is 6-8 per cent. Communist.
(9) Influence in the Police. In the immediate post-war period, similarly,Communists held many important positions in the police.   But recent Govern-ments,  with  Communists  excluded,  have  been  able  to effect  considerable&quot;purging,&quot; i.e., pensioning off of persons who obtained high appointments,m outside the normal hierarchy, at the time of the Liberation.   To-day, even in&apos; the Paris police, Communists are probably not much more than 20 per cent.(10) Influence in the Civil Service.^-The same trajectory is to be observed.But probably, the strength of Communist influence in the civil service is stillsubstantial, particularly in the nationalised industries.(11) Influence in the Trade Unions. The principal trade union federation,the C.G.T. (Confederation Generate du Travail), which is Communist-controlled,numbers some 2,500,000. Communist representation is strong on the joint factorycommittees which are compulsory in all enterprises employing more than 50workers (cf. our shop stewards committees). Since December last year, whenthe failure of the strikes showed that the rank-and-file of French workers were&quot; fed up &quot;with being dragged into political agitation, Communist leaders havedone their utmost to revive the so-called &apos;&apos; Communist fractions &apos;&apos; in the tradeunions. But they have not been altogether successful. Communist influence inthe trade unions, while it still continues strong, has probably passed its meridian.An estimate by M. Benoist-Frachon, Secretary-General of the C.G.T., early thisyear, that the number of paying members of the C.G-T. would shortly be in the region of 5 million, is a sheer flight of fancy. It is true, however, that theForce Ouvriere organisation (C.G.T.F.O.) musters little more than a million, andother trade union groups are relatively unimportant.(12) Contacts between French Communist leaders and Soviet Russia. Maurice Thorez, Secretary-General of the Communist Party since before the war,is Moscow-trained and is reported to have got on particularly well with Stalin.He spent some years in Russia during the war, after deserting from the french army. While he does his best to follow the party line e.g., the noticeable shift of tactics following the &quot; Cominform &quot; meeting in September 1947, of whichhis speech on 29th October at a meeting of the Central Committee of the party was the reflection he is said to have shown rather too much independent spiritto be completely in the good grace of the Kremlin. Other leaders more underthe thumb of Moscow like MM. Marty and Casanova have nothing like the prestigeor ability of Thorez.(13) Contacts with Leaders in Neighbouring Countries. There is no evidence that French Communist Party leaders depend from day-to-day or week-to-week on instructions from Moscow. They are well trained and there is always the Russian press and wireless, to say nothing of the post. Some attempt was made last winter to synchronise tactics and developments with the ItalianCommunist Party, and in late November Togliatti was thought to have visitedFrance to &quot; check up &quot; on the possibility of relating military and sabotage opera-tions in south-eastern France with similar developments in north-west Italy;but, on the whole, the French Communist Party has few links with other Com-munist Parties-except, of course, through membership of the Cominform. at times Moscow seeks to use the . French Communist Party as the main outpostof communism in Western Europe^ e.g., for directives to the parties in the low countries.(14) Potentialities as a Fifth Column. As to the potentialities of the P.C.F.as a &quot;Fifth Column,&quot; the best estimate of underground military strength is between 100,000 and 150,000. Of those who vote &quot; Communist &quot; in the electionsit is unlikely that a large percentage would, in fact, in the event of a war betweenthe Soviet Union and the West, go out and fight for, or indeed give any sort of aid to Soviet Russia. Nevertheless there are serious possibilities of strikesw and sabotage.&quot; In a country like France with a long-standing political tradition it isinconceivable that the electoral strength of the Communist Party should indicatethat the nation as a whole desires to travel along the Moscow road. It is animportant fact, however, which should never be overlooked, that the CommunistParty has established itself firmly in France as the workers&apos; party (particularlybut not exclusively industrial workers) supplanting !the S.F.I.O. Whateverhappens in the parliamentary arena, this position is unlikely to change.&quot; Labourism,&quot; which gives French communism its strength, has come to stay.
BELGIUM(1) Yes,  The Communist Party is legal.(2) Membership of the Party One hundred thousand at the beginning of1948 (108,000 in September 1945; 10,000 before the war). The Party machine isundergoing thorough overhaul, necessitated by this ten-fold expansion; and it ishoped to recruit 5,000 branch secretaries by the end of 1948. These, in turn,are expected to recruit some 50,000 militants surs et devoues. Of the presentParty total, it is almost certain that an appreciable number have not paid theirdues.(3) Percentage of Total Population. 1-2 per cent, (the population is approximately 8,300,000).(4),Percentage of the Electorate. Electorate figure unknown; but the Partypolled 12-7 per cent, of the total votes 2,365,638 cast at the General election of February 1946.(5) Representation in Parliament. 23 Deputies in the Chamber of Repre-sentatives (9 before the war) out of a total of 202, or 11-4 per cent.(6) Membership of Government. Not since M. Spaak took office with aChristian Social-Socialist coalition in March 1947. The Left-wing Cabinet ofhis predecessor, M. Huysmans, included four Communists.(7) Voting Strength.- 300,099 votes were polled for Communist candidatesat the General Election of February 1946.(8) Influence in the Armed Forces. No evidence of any influence.(9) Influence in the Police. Very small influence perhaps negligible.(10) Influence in the Civil Service. Unknown; but the impression is thatit is inconsiderable.(11) Influence in the Trade Unions. Communist penetration of trade unionsis estimated to be about 30 per cent. not more and is perhaps declining. Sofar as individual industries are concerned, the party&apos;s influence seems to begreatest with the heavy engineering and metallurgical industries. It is now known that the party has recently been instructed to begin immediate infiltrationof the building and electrical industries (including power stations), using themethods which proved so successful in Czechoslovakia. Those engaged in these activities have been issued with a document known as Le Carnet de VHomme deConfiance, which is believed to be identical with a document issued to militantsin Czechoslovakia. Infiltration of other industries is also to begin; but so farthese have not been specified.(12) Contacts between Belgian Communist Leaders and Soviet Russia.- Unknown.(13) Contacts with Leaders in Neighbouring Countries. There was ameeting on 4th January, 1948, between two members of the Central Committeeof the Belgian Communist Party Julien Lahaut, President of the Party, andJean Bertrand, National Secretary and. an unnamed delegate from the FrenchCommunist Party. The meeting was held for the purpose of planning concerted action in the event of international conflict; and it is believed that the selection of points along the Franco-Belgian frontier at which French or alien Communist&quot; refugees &quot; could enter Belgium secretly and form a maquis on the Belgianside, and the question of supplies for the proposed maquis, were among the subjects discussed.(14) Military Organisation of the Parly. While there is some sign of para-military activity, the Belgian authorities are of the opinon that the Belgian Com-munist Party is not in a position to initiate any revolutionary action in the nearfuture. Early this year, however, French and Belgian Communist elements were reported to be smuggling arms and explosives by rail from France to Belgium.GRAND DUCHY OF LUXEMBOURGOwing to quite inadequate information, it is difficult (if not impossible)to answer most of the questions. The Luxembourg Communist Party is believed to be very small.   Nevertheless, it succeeded in getting five candidates returned
to the Chamber at the first post-war general election of October 1945; previouslythere were no Communists in the Chamber. One Communist was then allotteda portfolio; but the Cabinet reconstruction in March 1947 ousted Communists andSocialists alike. Election figures in Luxembourg are very misleading, owing toI the system of plural voting (as well as proportional representation) employed,which often gives the various parties a poll appreciably in excess of the country&apos;spopulation (approximately 300,000). Moreover, half the Chamber is elected everythree years. The southern half of the country has recently had such an election(June 1948), involving four of the five Communist seats. All four seats were retained, but the party is estimated to have lost about 15 per cent, of votes to theSocialists (who gained three seats at the expense of the Christian Social Party).There are fifty-one seats in the Chamber, so that Communist representation is just over 10 per cent.THE NETHERLANDS(1) The Communist Party is legal. (Established in 1909.) It is calledCommunistische Partij Nederland (C.P.N.).(2) Party leaders announced the membership as 53,000 on 1st September,1947.  A recent estimate suggests that it has fallen to about 50,000.(3) Membership represents about - 54 per cent, of the total population.(4) Total of electorate 5,444,785 (July 1948). Communist poll at the GeneralElection of July 1948, was 7 - 74 per cent, of a total poll of 4V933,735 (10 - 6 percent, of a total poll of 4,760,711 in May 1946).(5) There are eight members in the Second (Lower) Chamber out of 100, or8 per cent, (ten in May, 1946; three before the war).(6) No Communist has ever served in a Dutch Cabinet.(7) The Party polled 381,953 votes at the General Election of July 1948(502,963 in May 1946).  i(8) Influence in Armed Forces is believed to be nil. Unsuccessful attemptswere made by the Communist Party to persuade troops to desert on the eve oftheir departure for the Netherlands East Indies in 1946.(9) Influence in the Police is believed to be very small.(10) There is no information as to influence in the Civil Service.(11) At one time Communist penetration of the trade unions was estimatedat about 30 per cent.; but recently the Party has lost much ground even in theso-called &quot; Unity Trade Union,&quot; which it founded soon after the war and whichit dominates. This union hoped to capture waverers and malcontents from the powerful Catholic and Socialist Unions, but in this it was mainly unsuccessful;although until the coup in Czechoslovakia its ranks included a certain numberof Left-wing Socialist elements and others. These have since broken away andthe strength of the Unity Union is now principally derived from the Rotterdamand Amsterdam dock-workers, who in any case provided its original member-ship.&apos; The Communist trade union strength has recently been estimated at100,000-120,000, as against 850,000 in the non-Communist unions.(12) The General Secretary of C.P.N., Saul de Groot, visited Russia in1935 and 1946; the Secretary, Johannes Pieter Schalker, visited Russia before1940, and the Second Secretary, Jan Halken, travelled through the Soviet zone of Germany in 1947 and attended the S.E.D. Congress in Berlin. Saul de Grootattended the Communist Party Congress in England in 1947 and Jan Halkenthe French Communist Congress in the same year. Dockers&apos; delegates fromRotterdam and Antwerp met in Belgium in October 1947 to discuss the meansof defeating a secret agreement reached between the shipping companies in thesetwo ports for unloading ships in one port in the event of the others being para-lysed by a strike. (The only serious strikes in the Netherlands since the war have* involved dockers.)a       (14) The dock workers might prove troublesome in case of a conflict withRussia.  Isolated acts of sabotage might also occur.SPAINThere have been no free parliamentary election in Spain since the civil war (1936-39). Before the advent of the Republic in 1931 the Spanish Com-munist Partv was insignificant and sent no member to the Cortes.   The first and
second Parliaments of the Republic 1931 and 1933 each contained one Com-munist Deputy (not the same person) and it was not until the Popular FrontGovernment in 1936 that the Communist Party, by previous arrangement betweenthe parties, was allotted 16 seats.There are no accurate figures available for the number of Communists in spain to-day. It seems fairly certain that in addition to their own secretorganisation individual Communists have infiltrated into the ranks of theclandestine political organisations, such as the U.G.T. (the Socialist Trade Union)and the Anarchist Trade Union, the C.N.T. Many erstwhile Communists are also said to have changed their coats and joined the ranks of the Falange Party, theone official party in Spain to-day.A recent report stated that the present strength of the Communist Party inthe two industrial areas, the Basque Provinces and Catalonia, was in the firstcase negligible and in the second not much greater.PORTUGALIn Portugal the Communist Party is an illegal organisation. Its originalfounder, Jose de Souza, was sent to Tarrafal Concentration Camp many yearsago and released under the 1945 amnesty, returning to Portugal. He is reportedto have become disillusioned with the Communist Party. A Dr. Alvaro Cunhalhas been mentioned in reports as being the ablest of the present leaders. Thereis some reason to believe that the Party has affiliations with the Brazilianorganisation, the Movimento Unificador dos Trabalhadores, which in turn is saidto be subsidised from Russia.A recent report from American sources gave the strength of the presentPortuguese Communist Party as 250; we have no confirmation of this figure.There has recently been evidence of Government disquiet at the undergroundactivities of the Communist Party. A Government communique issued on24th April last alleged Communist penetration of the M.U.D. (Movement of democratic Unity) a respectable organisation grouping elements in oppositionto Dr. Salazar&apos;s Government. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador commented at the time that he saw no reason to doubt this statement. There has since been a policedrive to round up suspects.ITALY(1) There is a legal Communist Party.(2) Membership on 15th December, 1947 : 2,330,887 *(3) Percentage of the 1947 population: 5.(4) Percentage of the electorate: 8-2.(5) Number of members of the Chamber of Deputies: 145, 25-3 per cent.;Number of members, together with Nenni Socialists (Popular Front), in the senate: 119, 34-9 per cent.(6) Members in the National Government: None.(7) Votes recorded in the National election of 18th April, 1948 : 6-41 millionapproximately.!(8) Influence in the Armed Forces. Probably not strong. The Army is reasonably reliable. The Prime Minister has stated that only a few regimentsare now affected.  Conditions of service are being improved.(9) Influence in the Police. Greatly reduced in the six months before the april 1948 elections.  The Force is now reasonably reliable.(10) Influence in the Civil Service. During the period of the CoalitionGovernments a number of Communists were probably introduced into offices whichhad Communist Ministers. It is likely that the number fell during the 21 monthsof De Gasperi&apos;s fourth and fifth Governments. The economic condition of lower-grade officials has also been improved.* 2,330,887 was the number of membership cards announced at the Party Congress, Milan,January 1948.   An independent source gave the number as only 1,200,000.t The actual number of votes received by the Communist Party is not known. Votes receivedby the Popular Front (Communists and Nenni Socialists together) were 8,025,990. Of 182Popular Front seats in the Chamber 145 are held by Communists; the votes have been dividedin the same proportion as the seats.
(11) Influence in the Trade Unions. Hitherto Communist control has beenstrong. At the elections held at the June 1947 meeting of the General confederation-tion of Labour (C.G.I.L.) the Communists obtained 60 per cent, of the votes.There are indications that their strength has declined and that the minorityr groups are playing a more important part. On 17th June these groups formed the Independent Trade Union Alliance to function inside the C.G.I.L.(12) Known Contacts between the Leaders and Soviet Russia. Apart fromthe occasional visits of official Russian delegations, such as that to the congress of the Italian Party in January 1948, the only known contacts take place at thehighest level e.g., between the Soviet Embassy in Rome and Togliatti and othermembers of the Executive of the Party, or during the visit of Italian Communistleaders to other countries, such as those of Reale and Longo to Warsaw for theCominform meeting in September 1947, of Secchia and Togliatti to Prague andBudapest in June 1948 and of Paietta to Belgrade during the same month. Itmust be remembered that many Italian Communists spent long years in Russiaduring the Fascist regime and some held important posts, e.g., Grieco became amember of the Comintern Directorate, Togliatti a Vice-Secretary.(13) Known Contacts between the Leaders and Communists in neighbouring countries. The preceding paragraph indicates that contacts with leaders in neighbouring countries are not uncommon. The visit of Togliatti to Marshal Titoin November 1946 led to the proposed surrender of Yugoslav claims to Trieste in exhange for Gorizia. Italian Communists have had to walk warily where Triesteand Gorizia are concerned, but contacts are undoubtedly close.(14) Fifth-column Potentialities. If the figure officially announced at theParty Congress is correct there are over 2,300,000 Italians who are sufficientlyconvinced Communists to hold Party membership cards, and they would provideenough fifth-columnists all over the country to cause considerable trouble. strike action alone by the Communist-controlled Trade Unions and sabotage by under-world Party members could hold up the country&apos;s war production very seriously.In addition the Communists have organised fighting groups, consisting largelyof ex-partisans. At the time of the elections the Foreign Office estimated that thenumber which could be raised at short notice as a military formation would notexceed 40,000. There has been no later information suggesting a different figure.The Communists had large hidden stores of arms, but since the elections greaterconfidence in the Government&apos;s security forces has led to information about thesestores being given to the police. It is reported, however, that the PartyDirectorate has agreed on the need to reorganise its underground military forces and to entrust this reorganisation to Signor Longo, the leader of the more violentsection of the Party.The Present Situation -. There is little doubt that the extent of the ChristianDemocrat victory came as an unpleasant surprise to the Communist Party andthat the policy to be followed is still under consideration. For the present,Communist action seems likely to be confined to constant active opposition to theGovernment in Parliament and to the organisation of strikes and demonstrationsall over the country, taking advantage of genuine economic grievances. May and june have seen a long, serious strike in the Palermo dockyards and strikes ofagricultural workers in the north. The Party seems also to be concentrating onthe Regional elections likely to be held in the autumn. Signor Negarville hasresigned the post of Mayor of Turin and has been put in charge of the Partyheadquarters in Piedmont in order to organise the Regional election compaign.The extent of support which the Party will have from Nenni&apos;s Socialists is uncertain, but in the meantime the Communists are likely to get all the propaganda value they can out of the existence of the Popular Democratic Front.TRIESTESince 3rd September, 1947, all local Communists have been incorporated inthe Communist Party of the Free Territory of Trieste (P.C.T.L.T.), the successorof the Giulian Communist Party. The situation is complicated by the fact thatthe Party is both Communist and pro-Slav. Communist organisations in theTerritory are vigorous, particularly the Anti-Fascist-Italo-Slovene Union(U.I.A.S.) described as the spearhead of opposition to A.M.G. Its secretary,Branko Babic, is also the political secretary of the Trieste Communist Party.35883 &apos; c
The number of Party members in the Territory is not known. A.M.Ggave the population figures of the territory in&apos; 1946 as approximately227,000 Italians and 52,000 Slavs. The Slavs include a small body of anti-Communist Slovenes, who are not politically vigorous, but the majorityof the Slavs probably belong to the Communist Party, as do considerable numbers of Italian workers. It has been estimated by His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;political Adviser in Trieste that if local elections are held the Communists willpoll at least 20 per cent, of the votes. The so-called Independence Front ofindeterminate membership, whose leaders are nonentities, is used by the Com-munists to uphold the idea of strict implementation of the Treaty.The Communists are active in the Trade Unions. The Sindacati Uniciincludes most of the workers in the heavy industries and is Communist andSlavophil. The rival Union, the Camera del Lavoro, which is non-Communistand pro-Italian, is a much less efficient body and mainly represents the &apos;&apos; white-collared proletariat.&quot;GREECEK.K.E. Strength. The Greek Communist Party (K.K.E. KommounistikonKomma Ellados) was founded in 1920. was suppressed but thrived undergroundduring the Metaxas dictatorship (1936-^1). and took a leading part in the resistance-tance movement during the occupation. It has tried to overthrow the GreekGovernment since the liberation, and was outlawed by the present Government inDecember 1947. Its youth organisation (E.P.O.N. Eniaia Panelladike OrganosisNeon) was dissolved by court order in February 1947; at that time E.P.O.N&apos;sstrength was estimated at 185,000, excluding those fighting in the mountains.The strength of K.K.E. as a whole cannot be calculated, although detailed statisticsare available of individual cells and satellite organisations; but it is estimated(June 1948) that between 24,000 and 25,000 rebels are fighting against the greek army in the mountains. It must not be assumed, however, that all of these areCommunists.Communists in Government. -There are no Communists in the Greek Govern-ment as there are none in the Chamber of Deputies. At the last General Election(March 1946) the Left-wing parties abstained from voting, but an analysis madeby the Allied Mission which observed the elections gives some indication of the potential Communist vote. The mission reported that of 40 per cent, of the electorate who did not vote, 25 per cent, abstained because of sickness, physicalincapacity, indifference, or similar causes which seemed to have no relation toany political &quot; policy,&quot; and only some 15 per cent. (280,000 persons) abstainedfor &quot; party &quot; reasons. Again, not all of these were Communists. The 280,000abstainers also included the E.L.D. coalition (the Union of Leftist Democrats), asmall group of former Liberals, and three or four smaller groups of the left Centre.In the mountainous parts of Greece controlled by the rebels, the communists in December 1947 set up a &quot; Provisional Democratic Government of Free Greece &quot;under the premiership of &quot; General Markos &quot; (Markos Vafiades). This Juntawas not recognised by any Government but it was welcomed by Communists every-where and representatives were sent to Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. In the &quot; FreeGovernment^ &quot; territory a form of local government and legislature were set up,and local &quot; elections &quot; held.I Communist Penetration.-It is difficult to assess the degree of Communistpenetration of the services, the police, the civil service, the trade unions or thenon-Communist political parties, but estimates can be attempted as follows : (a) The A rmed Forces and police the Communist Organisation of the Army and Security Corps(K.O.S.S.A. Kornmounistike Organosis Stratou Somaton Asfaleias) was formed in February 1945. Its aims are: to incite disobedience and riotsin the armed forces; to collect intelligence on such subjects as order of battle of Government forces, military intentions, defence works, officers&apos; personalrecords and intelligence obtained by Greek Government; to encourage deser-tion to the Rebel Army. In March 1948 K.O.S.S.A&apos;s strength was claimed to be 20,483 (394 officers and 20,089 other ranks) but 7,174 of these had been detained by the Greek Government on Makronisos, leaving an effectivestrength of 13.309.
(b) Civil service in March 1947 K.K.E. records showed 11.250 Communists in Governmentdepartments and 315 in nationalist organisations of civil servants. At thattime it was estimated that 7 per cent, of K.K.E. were civil servants; certainlyone of the 16 K.K.E. sections in Athens was formed entirely of eivUservants. Since December 1947, however,it has been impossible for any avowedCommunist to hold any civil service post and most of them have been dis-missed; but it is impossible to guess how many crypto-Commciusts remain.(c) Trade UnionsThe Workers&apos; Anti-Fascist League (Ergas-Ergatikos Anti-fasistikosSyndesmos) is the workers&apos; association through which the Communists hope to penetrate the Greek trade unions. In March 1946, Ergas managed tosecure five seats on the Executive of the Greek Confederation of Labouras against four for its combined opponents, but in July their election was declared invalid and a provisional executive was appointed to act until freshelections could be held at a congress in March 1948. From this congressa predominantly Right-wing executive emerged, and it seems that Ergas&apos;sinfluence in the trade unions is decreasing; but their numbers are unknown.(d) Non-Communist Political PartiesEstimates of Communist penetration of the other political parties areattempted from time to time, but no reliable figures are available.Known Contaxts with Communists Abroad. Zachariades (the leader ofK.K.E.) and Porfyrogenis make regular visits to Moscow and the Central Euro-pean countries. Moreover, practically every capital in Europe, including London,and New York have their Committees for Aid to Democratic Greece, which sendfinancial and material aid to the Greek Communists. In addition, united nations observers have witnessed the logistical support given by Albania. bulgaria and Yugoslavia to the rebels.Potential Fifth Column. It is unsafe to assume that the numbers quoted above represent a potential fifth column. Probably nine-tenths of the tlreekrebels and their supporters are at heart Greeks first and Communists second, whowould not hesitate to join the Greek Army against any foreign invader.NORWAY(I) There is a legal Communist Party, the Norges Kommunistiske parti.(2) Its actual membership is about 30,000.(3) This represents about 1 -1 per cent, of the total population.(4) Its percentage of the electorate is about 1-5 per cent.(5) It has 11 seats of 150 members in the national Parliament, representing7-3 per cent.(6) It has no members in the national Government.(7) In recent elections it has polled : (a) One hundred and sixty-seven thousand seven hundred and four votes inthe Storting elections of 1945.   The Communist vote represented11-37 per cent, of the total poll.(&amp;) One hundred and forty-three thousand two hundred and five votes in thelocal elections held in November 1947.  This represented 10-4 per cent.of all votes, as the poll was smaller than in the Storting elections.(8) Its influence in the armed forces is negligible.(9) Its influence in the police is very small.(10) Its influence in the Civil Service is very small. No known organisedpenetration of Government Departments or Civil Service organisations.(II) Its influence in the trade unions is small. In 1947 the party lost controlover its last two district trades councils. Only about one-seventh of the membersof the Representative Council of the L.O., the highest trade union organ, areCommunists. The party has been particularly active in the Seamen&apos;s Union, but has met with only very moderate success.35883 - c 2
(12) No regular open contact between its leaders and Soviet Russia ismaintained. Communist leaders pay occasional visits to the Soviet Union andsatellite countries.(13) Periodical meetings with Swedish and Danish Communists are held.Finnish Communists frequently also participate.(14) Norwegian Communists gained considerable experience of undergroundwork during the occupation, but it is doubtful whether any great number of party members would be prepared to fight against their own countrymen. Com-munist fifth-column activity is likely to be strongest in northern Norway, butthe party&apos;s potentialities are probably lower than those of the Danish and Swedishsister parties.DENMARK(I) There is a legal Communist Party, the Danmarks Kommunistiske Parti.(2) Its actual membership is about 28,000.(3) Its percentage of the total population is less than 1 per cent.(0-7 per cent.).(4) Party membership constituted 1 -1 per cent, of the 1947 electorate.(5) It has 9 seats of a total of 148 in the national Parliament, representing6 -1 per cent.(6) It has no members in the national Government.(7) It polled 141,094 votes in the elections to the Folketing in 1947. Thefigure represented 6 - 8 per cent, of the poll.(8) Its influence in the armed forces is very small in the actual services, butconsiderably greater in the Home Guard. Certain sections of the latter have beenreported to be composed preponderantly of Communists. Lately the Communistshave lost ground also in the Home Guard, and the vast majority of the force is fully reliable.(9) Its influence in the police is very small.(10) Its influence in the Civil Service is very small.   No known organised- penetration of Government Departments or Civil Service organisations.(II) The Communists are fairly strong in certain trade unions, but their influence within the movement as a whole is not great. It is greatest withincertain unions in the capital, such as the Copenhagen Printers&apos; Union, but can hardly be regarded as a serious challenge to the Social Democrats.(12) No regular open contact between its leaders and Soviet Russia is main-tained. Communist leaders pay occasional visits to the Soviet Union and satellitecountries.(13) Danish Communist leaders frequently meet their Swedish and norwegian opposite numbers. Contact with Sweden appears to be more frequentthan with Norway.(14) Its potentialities as a fifth-column are probably not very great, but manyCommunists gained experience of underground work during the occupation. Aconsiderable quantity of arms is still at large in the country, and of these asubstantial proportion may well be in Communist hands:SWEDEN(1) There is a legal Communist Party, the Sveriges Kommunistiska parti.(2) The party leadership claims an actual membership of 60,000.(3) Its percentage of the population is less than one per cent. (0 - 9 per cent.)(4) The present membership constitutes 1-39 per cent, of the electorate asit existed at the 1944 elections.(5) Fifteen seats of a total of 230 in the National Parliament, representing6 - 5 per cent.(6) It has no members in the national government.
(7) Ii polled 318,466 votes, representing 10-3 per cent, of the total poll, inthe 1944 elections. This may be regarded as a peak figure and the Communistsare certain to lose votes in the next elections, due in September 1948.(8) Its influence in the armed forces is negligible. The military authorities,moreover, keep a watchful eye. on known Communists during their conscriptservice.(9) Its influence in the police is very small. In Stockholm a Communist,Set Persson, presides over the Police Committee of the City Council, but he can hardly be said to exercise effective control over the force.(10) Its influence in the Civil Service is very small. A certain number ofCommunists must be expected to have entered the Civil Service, but there areno indications of organised penetration either in Government Departments or inCivil Service organisations.(11) The Communists are strong in certain trade unions, notably those of the metal workers, and the influence which they wield within the movement is dis-proportionately large to the numbers. Nevertheless, they only constitute a small,though well organised, minority.(12) No overt regular contact is maintained between its leaders and SovietRussia. Communist leaders pay occasional visits to the Soviet Union and to Sovietsatellite countries. ;(13) Frequent meetings take place between Scandinavian Communist leaders.Representatives of the Finnish Communist Party are also often present. Theexistence of a Scandinavian Communist Bureau has been rumoured. It is saidthat it formely had its location in Oslo, but that it was moved to Gothenburgduring the spring of 1948. The police in that city have been unable to confirmthese reports.(14) Its potentialities as a fifth-column can hardly be rated high. The vast majority of party members would probably shrink from taking an active partagainst their own country in case of war. The Communist leaders would almost certainly be rounded up by the police very rapidly, but a certain amount of sabotage might be expected, in all probability directed chiefly against communica-tions, power installations and shipyards.EGYPT(I) There is no legal Communist Party. There are, however, certain illegalCommunist groups, the largest being Hameto and Shar, which recently fused and formed a central committee which appears to have adopted the title &apos;&apos; Haraketel-Dimokratiya lil Tahrur el-Watani &quot; (Democratic Movement for national liberation). There are other groups with Communist sympathies. A &quot;Committeeof Students and Workers,&quot; formed in February 1946 with which the Wafd wasassociated, may have Communist support.(2, 3 and 4) It is impossible to make any estimate of the total strength ofthese parties or to distinguish between groups and individual members who aregenuine Marxists, and those who are reformers or agitators of various shades ofpink.(5 and 6) It has no members in the National Parliament or Government.(7) It has recorded no votes in recent elections, national or local.(8) The evidence on the extent to which communism has permeated the armed forces is conflicting. A body called the &quot; Military Society for the Union ofPersecuted Policemen and Soldiers in Egypt &quot; issued a pamphlet in 1947 incitingdisaffection among the security forces.- (9) Reports about its influence in the police are conflicting. There is no evidence that the recent police strike in Alexandria was Communist-inspired.(10) The extent of its influence in the Civil Service is unknown, but it mustbe remembered that Civil Servants would be particularly careful to keep any suchsympathies secret.(II) The trade unions themselves are not federated, but are separate andlocal. The Transport Workers&apos; Union alone is affiliated to the InternationalFederation of Transport Workers&apos; Unions.   An illegal body, the Congress of
Egyptian Syndicates, of which one of the leaders is Muhammad Yusuf al-Mudarik,a Communist, was formed in May 1947. Al-Mudarik was one of the Egyptianrepresentatives at the 1946 Conference at Prague of the World Federation ofTrade Unions. He also leads a &quot; Democratic Committee for the Liberation ofLabour,&quot; which is the trade union counterpart of the &quot; Movement &quot; noted in (1).(1) The &quot; Democratic Movement,&quot; led by Henri Curiel, the leading figure inEgyptian communism, is said to have no association with the Soviet Legation in cairo. Members of the Wafd Party who are reported to have Communist lean-ings are stated to have been in contact with the legation (see (14)). The SovietLegation in Beirut is, however, believed to be the centre for Communist activities in the Arab countries of the Middle East.(13) Henri Curiel is believed to have secret contacts with Communistorganisations in Prague, Paris and Athens. Satellite representatives, notably the Yugoslav (though this may no longer be the case) are thought to be activepropagandists.(14) The Egyptian masses are easily roused and might cause trouble. Unless-the Wafd allowed themselves to become the instrument of communism there is nostrong party or prominent leader who would dangerously appeal to the mob, the armed forces and the civil administration. There have been reports of penetration-tion by communism of the Wafd ranks, but to no serious degree, and lately bothNahas Pasha, the leader of the Wafd, and the new Secretary-General, Seraged-Din Pasha, have declared their intention of purging the party of Communistelements. Minority communities, such as the Armenians (a special target forSoviet propaganda) and the Jews, are unpopular and likely to be ineffective.National groups Greeks, Italians, &amp;c. may include Communists in small numbers, but they would have a very limited effectiveness.SYRIA(1) There is no legal Communist Party. It was suppressed on 2nd December,1947,&apos; after four years of overt, but not continuously legalised, existence. the suppression was followed on 18th December by the suppression of all pro-Sovietorganisations.(2) The actual membership of illegal Communist movements is estimated at,000-2,500 (excluding Armenian Communists less than 500). Sympathisersare estimated at 15,000-20,000.(3) The percentage of the total population is about - 07 per cent, (sympathisers-7 per cent.).(4) The percentage of the electorate is about -15 per cent, (sympathisers1-5 per cent.).(5) They have no members in the National Parliament.(6) They have no members in the National Government.(7) No Communist stood as such in&apos;the July 1947 elections, and no knownCommunist standing under another banner was elected.(8) In the. middle of 1946 it was reported that no trace of Communismappeared in the Syrian Army. At the end of 1947 it was reported that penetration of the Army and of the Military Academy at Horns had been attempted, andthat these attempts had the tacit support of the Minister of Defence. If thisis so, there has as yet been no evidence of any successful results of penetration.(9) At the end of 1947 an attempt at penetration of the &quot; Deuxieme Bureau &apos;&apos;was reported.(10) So far as is known they have no influence in the Civil Service.(11) Trade Union organisation is weak; there is no central body, though there )is a Damascus Federation of Trade Unions. Communists have made efforts to penetrate the Unions, but an estimate of their membership of the principalUnions (May 1948) puts it at rather less than 1 per cent, (excluding sympathisersand fellow-travellers). On the other hand, in October 1947, Communists were reported to have gained six out of nine places among the newly-elected members to the Committee of the Damascus Tailors&apos; Syndicate. It is clearly the policyof the Communists to penetrate the Unions, but so far they have not had muchsuccess.
(12) Relations with the Soviet Legation in Beirut were maintained even afterthe suppression of the Party in Syria. This Legation is believed to be a source of funds for the Party.The Polish Consul in Damascus has been reported to have engaged in&quot;undesirable activities.&quot;The Orthodox Church has certain links with the Russian OrthodoxPatriarchate.(13) From 1943 to 1945 the Lebanese and Syrian Communist Parties acted as one body. From June 1945, when the first National Congress was held, theParties of the two countries became separate. Since suppression in both countriesactivities have been more closely co-ordinated again.There has been considerable liaison with other Middle East countries-Iraq,Persia, Egypt, Palestine and Cyprus. Contacts have also been made with the balkans and France. In October 1947 an emissary was reported to be goingto Paris to contact the Comintern; later the Yugoslav Charge d&apos;Affaires in Beirutwas reported to be used as an emissary to the Cominf orm on his visit to Belgrade.(14) Although the leader of the Syrian Communists, Khalid Biqdash, issaid to be Cominf orm Agent for the Middle East, and is clearly a leadingCommunist figure in the Middle East, Syrian Communism is not far advanced.Its organisation is poor and it lacks trained cadres. It lost ground during theelections of July 1946, when it did not succeed in gaining a single seat, and theRussian attitude to Palestine since the autumn of 1947 has been disastrous to itscause. In April 1948, Biqdash &apos;was reported to have given orders that all Partyactivities must cease until further notice. Many desertions to the Muslim Brother-hood (which has denounced Communism) have been reported.As a political force in present political conditions its influence is negligible.The Party does, however, comprise a number of presumably loyal members who,in a &quot; revolutionary situation &quot; might cause considerable trouble, as they aredoubtless well-versed in the Communist revolutionary technique. Other countries whose pre-war percentages of Communists was under 1 per cent, of the population are now under a Communist dictatorship. The danger from fifth-columnactivities is not altogether a function of the number of known Communists.THE LEBANON(1) There is no legal Communist Party. It was suppressed on 8th January,1948, after four years of overt, though not legalised, existence. Affiliatedorganisations the Union of Syndicates and the Society for Cultural Relationswith the US.S.R. were also suppressed at about the same time.(2) An estimate of February 1948, puts the membership at 12,000, withsympathisers at 50,000.(3) The percentage of the total population is 1 per cent, (sympathisers4 per cent.).(4) The percentage of the electorate is 2 per cent, (sympathisers 8 per cent.).(5) They have no members in the National Parliament.(6) They have no members in the National Government.(7) In the May, 1947, national election 17,000 votes were polled forCommunist candidates, but the issues before the electorate were much confused andthis figure should not be considered as evidence of support.(8) There have been reports of attempted penetration of the armed forcesbut none of success.(9) There have been reports of attempted penetration of the police but none of success.(10) There have been reports of attempted penetration of the Civil Service,but none of success.(11) Penetration of Trade Unions has been considerable. Mustafa Aris,member of the Central Committee of the Lebanese Communist Party and middle east Representative on the World Federation of Trade Unions, organised theCommunist-controlled &quot; Union of Syndicates &quot; with the object of gaining controlof the whole of the Lebanese Trade Union movement. &apos; In this he did not succeed,
and two anti-Communist groups have emerged &quot;The League of Workers&apos;Syndicates &quot; and the &quot; Labour Front.&quot; Early in 1947 the League consisted ofsome ten unions, as opposed to six in the Union of Syndicates, and claimed tobe at least as strong as the latter. In September 1947, the Government announcedthat no Trade Union might operate without an official licence a measure designed &quot;)to control Communist penetration. As a result of opposition to this enactment,particularly from Mustafa Aris who threatened widespread strikes, the Govern-ment allowed those Unions already in existence to continue. This concession hadthe effect of counteracting the Government intention and aiding the CommunistUnions, as it was made at a time when they were still fairly strong, but on thedecline. The suppression of the Union of Syndicates in January 1948, has reducedits influence to a level far below what it was before, though a newspaper inApril 1948 reported that ten Unions had petitioned the President for itsrecognition: the influence of the non-Communist Unions has consequentlyincreased.(12) The Soviet Legation at Beirut has been the centre of Russian contacts with Communist movements in the Levant countries. The Tass representative inthe Lebanon has also been actively engaged in Communist contacts and activities.There have been two visits this year from a Cominform representative. MustafaAris visited the International Trades Union Conference in Moscow in the autumn of 1946.(13) There have been frequent contacts with other countries in the middle east, particularly with Syria, from whose Communist Party the Lebanese Com-munist Party was separated only in 1945. Since the suppression of the communists of the two countries they have been co-ordinating their activitiesclosely.In April, 1948, there was a conference held in the Lebanon at whichCommunists from Syria, Iraq and Palestine were present.In May, 1948, negotiations were taking place with the Yugoslav Legation inBeirut to send a delegation to Yugoslavia.Mustafa Aris, though refused a permit by the Government for himself, plans to send a representative to the Paris meeting of the World Federation of TradeUnions. There have in the past been several visits to Paris by LebaneseCommunists to contact French and other Communists.14. During the last year there has been a decline in Communist influence,owing partly to Russian policy in Palestine. The decline was accelerated by the suppression of the Party and affiliated organisations, and there is now a lullin Communist activities. A clandestine newspaper continues to be printed,and has a circulation of about 1,500. There is not a high level of organisation norhighly-trained cadres in the Party, though membership is much larger thanin Syria.It has recently been reported that a few terrorist groups are being trained in sabotage, the objects of their activities, when begun, being to intimidatepoliticians and others into desisting from anti-Communist activities. The Party&apos;spotentialites as a fifth column are, like those of all Communist Parties, consider-able, though the numbers who would take part in such activities is unpredictableand would depend on the circumstances of the time.PALESTINE(1) The Palestine Communist Party is recognised as a political party by thepresent Jewish authorities. Details of Communist Party organisation are asfollows : (a) Jewish. &quot;)(i) The Palestine Communist Party (P.K.P.) Early this year it wasagreed that it should be regarded as a Jewish national party on condition that it ceased to oppose the creation of a JewishNational State (which it opposed until Russia declared in favourof it) and unrestricted immigration. It thereupon adopted thenew title of &quot; The Communist Party of Eretz Israel.&quot; the leader is Shmuel Mikunis, and other prominent members areMeir Wilner, Esther Wilenska and Eliahu Goszanski.
(ii) The Hebrew Communist Party, led by Meir Slonim, has alwaysfavoured Jewish national communism, in contrast to the P.K.P.,which, until the Russian change of policy over Palestine, aimed at collaboration with the Arabs and the creation of a unitaryState. Now that P.K.P. had adopted its policy there seems littlereason for the Hebrew Communist Party&apos;s separate existence.(b) AmrabThe Arab League for National Liberation (A.L.N.L.) is the Com-munist organisation. Originally part of the Palestine Com-munist Party, it became a separate party while retaining contacts with Jewish organisations. The breach became wide after last november, when the United Nations Assembly voted in favour of partition. Its leaders are Emil Thuma, Fuad Nasr and HannaNagana.(2) In April 1947 the P.K.P. was reported to number 3,700 full members and1,500 voluntary contributors. Its youth movement was estimated to be 650 strong.This brings the total number of party members and subscribers at that time toabout 6,000. The Hebrew Communist Party is estimated to have about,000 members. Fellow-travelling organisations, such as the V-League, the progressive Union of Ex-Servicemen, the Pan-Slav Union and others, are not included; sympathisers in these bodies must have increased recently owing toconsistent Russian support for the Jewish State.A.L.N.L. membership was reported to be 5,700 in April 1947. Since theUnited Nations partition resolution it has largely disintegrated, and its leaders have, for the most part, fled to the Levant. There have recently been reportsthat it is organising Arab workers under Jewish control in Nazareth, and is recognised by the Jews as a political party (August 1948).(3) Its percentage of the total population is approximately: Jews, 1 - 5 percent.; Arabs, 0-5 per cent.(4) There is no stable electorate in Palestine at present.(5) It has one seat on the Jewish Provisional National Council (of about37 members).(6) It has no members in the national Government.(7) In August 1944 the Popular Democratic Front (Jewish Communistelements) polled 3,780 votes in the elections for the Assepath Hanivharim(elected Assembly) and obtained three seats. Early in 1948 they negotiated withthe Jewish Agency for an extra seat in the Assembly which would entitle themto a seat on the Vaad Leumi. As they have a seat on the National Council now,it appears that their negotiations were successful.(8) (a) Haganah. In March it was reported that the strength of Palmach(the &quot;striking force &quot; of the Israeli army) was to be increased to 20,000, and thatthe force included many Russian-speaking members who had reached Palestineillegally. Some of these men had been trained in the U.S.S.R. for guerrilla war-fare. Another report stated that Communists had infiltrated into Haganah.Recent reports (August 1948) suggested that Palmach (supported by the extremeLeft &quot; United Workers&apos; Party,&quot; which wants a People&apos;s army) is resisting theJewish authorities&apos; attempts to incorporate it into the Israeli army.(b) Irgun was reported early in 1948 to be turning towards the U.S.S.R.Nahum Hilovi, a Russian Jew, was made deputy editor of the Irgun organ,Herut; he is believed to have entered Palestine illegally in October 1947 fromRussia. Beigin, the leader of Irgun, is reported to have been a member of thePolish Communist Party before going to Palestine, and to have had contacts withCommunists recently in Palestine.(c) The Stern Gang. There are similar reports about the Stern Gang in( any case a small group of 200-300.   A recent report states that the YugoslavGeneral Hie, with an assistant, Kersgieh(l), is &quot;instructor in sabotage&quot; toCommunist organisations in Palestine, and he was said to have been in contact with Stern Gang personnel. All public statements by the Stern Gang suggestthat it is an agent of Russian policy, which these statements reflect in both jargonand content.(9) The extent of its influence in the police is unknown.35883 D
(10) The extent of its influence in the Civil Service is unknown.(11) Jews.- After the fusion of the Hashomer Hatzairand the LabourUnity Party (both extreme Left parties with a &quot; class struggle &quot; programme) inJanuary 1948 it was reported that 40 per cent, of the Histadruth (Jewishtrades union movement) were veering towards the East, but that 20 per cent,only would follow an,extreme Left-wing party.The Histadruth is a very powerful organisation, which, in the past, has had,in effect, a large measure of control over the Jewish Agency in Palestine, and atpresent must have a great influence on the Provisional Government. Until 1946the Communists were excluded from the Histadruth, but in 1947 the P.K.P.gained a considerable influence in it. In August 1947 it was claimed that the.&quot; Communist Fraction &quot; in the movement numbered 7-8,000 (out of, perhaps,150,000).Arabs. In September 1947 the A.L.N.L. claimed to control 4,000 members,consisting of the &quot; Progressive Trade Unions,&quot; out of a total of 18,000 membersrepresented at the Arab Workers&apos; Congress.&apos; (12) Contacts with the Soviet Legation in Beirut have been frequent. Thisis especially true of the A.L.N.L., although when representatives of the legationvisited Palestine they have contacted Jewish Communists also. There have beena few contacts with the Soviet Legation in Cairo. Since August 1948 there hasbeen a Soviet Legation in Tel Aviv.Last November it was reported that members of the Slavonic Union, SovietSection (previously known as the Union of Russian Patriots) would have direct contact with the Central Committee. There are probably contacts with the JewishAhti-Fascist Committee headquarters in Moscow.Immigrants (illegal before 15th May, 1948) probably form a direct channel of contact with Soviet Russia, but numerical details are at present impossible toobtain.(13) The P close contact with the French Communists, and through them with the Anti-Fascist League in Moscow, which is the responsibility of. a soviet Minister.The Hebrew Communist Party has had links with the satellite countries,especially Poland...In Warsaw there is reported to have been set up early in 1947 a &apos;&apos; PolishPalestine Friendship Committee.&quot; Palestinians who have visited Warsaw havecollaborated with this committee.At the beginning of 1947 it was reported that the Jewish V-League was tobe extended, and that there would be a World Union of Jewish V-Leagues withcentres at Tel Aviv, Paris and Moscow.The Pan-Slav Union has contacts with satellite countries.Shmuel MikUnis has in the last month been making a tour of eastern europe.The P.K.P. made contact with Communists in the United States, when MeirWilner toured the country in late 1947 and succeeded in collecting substantial sums of money.There have been reports of Roumanian and German Groups in the P.K.P.The former appear to have been members of the Roumanian Communist Party, tohave been partisans during the war and to number about 50.The Polish Consulate-General in Tel Aviv developed during 1947 into a centre of Communist activities.There have also been contacts with Poland by extreme leftists, e.g., Dr. MosheSneh (Labour Unity Party), who is not an avowed Communist; he has visitedPoland twice within a year.(14) The potentialities of the A rab Communists as a fifth column are small,and, since the Russian support for partition, have become smaller. There are signs, however, that they may try to set up a &quot;collaborationist&quot; government under the Jews.The /wish Communists, though a small percentage of the total population .and with little representation in official bodies, represent a greater threat thai,their numbers indicate for reasons many of which are clear from the information given above. The conditions favourable to them are, in sum, as follows :-Thestate, of war or emergency in which armed violence prospers; the tendency of theJews to split into large numbers of political factions; the sympathy for theU.S.S.R., increased by the latter&apos;s consistent support in recent months for a jewish State; direct support from the U.S.S.R. and satellite countries in men andprobably war materials; the tradition of violence and authoritarianism among alarge part of the Jewish population of Palestine.
TRANS JORDANNo Communist organisations exist in Trans Jordan, and attempts by a fewindividuals to air communistic theories have been firmly suppressed by the Trans-jordan authorities. It is probable that the individuals in question were merelyseeking notoriety and were not members of any organisation.A law, published in the Official Gazette on 16th May, 1948, makes all activi-ties in favour of communism illegal,IRAQ(I) There is no legal Communist Party. In January 1947, however, theexistence of two clandestine Communist groups, the Iraqi Communist Party andthe&apos; League of Iraqi Communists, was confirmed. These two groups, of whichthe first is the larger and more important, have maintained close liaison and theredoes not appear to be any serious divergence of outlook between them; they havebeen kept apart more by the rivalry of their leaders. Since these leaders, togetherwith several of their followers, were arrested (January 1947) the two groups havebeen driven further underground, and information about their present activitiesis scanty. Two other illegal, Left-wing organisations, the Anti-Zionist league and the National Liberation Party (Hizb at Taharrur al Watani), have been inclose contact with the Iraqi Communist Party, and it is probable that they havefunctioned as an executive arm of it.(2) Membership figures are unreliable. In January 1947 it was estimated(from captured documents and the interrogation of arrested persons) that the combined membership of both groups amounted to about 4,000 persons, divided between the two in roughly equal proportions. At the time these figures were considered high, and the present active membership is probably not morethan 2,000.(3) This represents -05 per cent, of the total population (based on 1943census figures, giving total population as 4 million).(4) This represents also - 2 per cent, of the electorate (very approximately).(5) They have no members in the National Parliament.(6) They have no members in the National Government.(7) They have recorded no votes in recent elections, national or local.(8) Communist influence in the armed forces is not great. Some communist propaganda has, however, been disseminated (probably by a few junior officers,N.C.O.s and men), and it is believed that the best results have been obtained amongthe men of the mechanised units, the R.I.A.F. apprentices and the TechnicalSchool students. In August, 1947, it was reported (reliability somewhat doubtful)that there were fifty Communist cells (each consisting of about five persons) in the ranks of the Army.(9) The same report mentions fourteen cells in the Police, but communist influence in this force appears to be negligible.(10) One report alleges the existence of cells in the civil administration(including the Railways), the greatest number being in the Education Department.(II) The Communists had established an important footing in the TradeUnions by January 1947. Their influence has been most noticeable in the railway workers&apos; Union. The serious railway strike of April 1945 was Communist-inspired. Communist penetration of the Shoemakers&apos;, Weavers&apos; and PressCompositors&apos; Unions has also been reported.(11a) The Students, particularly those of the Baghdad Law College, forma section of the community particularly susceptible to Communist propaganda.- The number of active Communists among the students must be considered small,however : in the police round-up of January 1947 only two were discovered(apart from several Law College graduates). The Iraqi Communists have also made some attempt to disseminate their propaganda among the Kurdish,Armenian and Assyrian minorities (using, especially, the Armenian and AssyrianOrthodox Church), and the Jews. But where such attempts appear to have had some success (as with the Kurds) the adoption of Left-wing views reflects more the: desire to achieve national independence than sympathy with Communistideology.35883 n 2
(12) Although the Soviet Legation in Baghdad has taken an interest in the iraqi Communist groups there is no evidence that it has exercised any controlover them. A reliable report indicates that, since January 1947, contact withRussia has been maintained through the Soviet Consulate at Ahwaz. The SovietEmbassy at Tehran has also been mentioned in this sense.(13) Until January 1947 both groups were in touch with the Syrian Com-munist Party and, to a lesser extent, with the Tudeh of Persia. Tudeh agitatorshave entered Iraq as &quot; pilgrims &quot; to the Shi&apos;a shrines of Karbala and Najaf.(14) There are several factors which might favour the creation of a fifth column by the Communists : the failure of the Government to better the lot ofthe peasants and industrial workers; the growth of unemployment in the townsowing to the war-time attractions of lucrative, but temporary, employment; theexistence of dissatisfied minorities, Kurds, Shi&apos;as and Armenians, Assyrians andChaldaeans (though these Christian communities are unlikely to act as groups;they would most likely provide individual agitators).PERSIA(I) No legal Communist Party exists. The Tudeh Party is, however, Com-munist in most respects, although it supports the Persian Constitution. Govern-ment opposition has driven it underground, although it is not strictly an illegalparty.(2) Reliable figures are non-existent. The number of active members (as distinct from potential supporters) is probably not more than 20,000-40,000.(3) This represents, very roughly, -05 per cent, of the total population.(4) It also represents, very roughly, -2 per cent, of the electorate.(5) It has no members in the Majlis. The Party decided to boycott the 1947elections, but eight Tudeh Deputies (out of 136) were elected to the FourteenthMajlis (Parliament) which held office from 1944 to 1946.(6) Three Tudeh Ministers held office from August to October, 1946, underQawam-as-Sultaneh.  There are none at present.(7) No information is available as to the votes it has recorded in recentelections, national or local.(8) There is little evidence of Tudeh influence in the armed forces now,although in August 1945 the Tudeh were responsible for instigating a seriousmutiny in the Meshed garrison.(9) The Police Training School in Tehran is reported (May 1948) to be aTudeh propaganda centre. Otherwise there is no evidence of Tudeh support inthe Police Force.(10) Its influence in the Civil Service is negligible (probably non-existent).(II) The Party makes its strongest appeal through the trade unions whichit controls. At present (April 1948)it is estimated that about one-third of theindustrial population of Tehran and Isfahan (the two largest towns) are membersof or active sympathisers with the Tudeh unions (of which the Railway Workers&apos;Union is probably the most powerful). Although the Tudeh instigated the seriousstrike in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company&apos;s Abadan refinery in July 1946, Tudehinfluence among the A.I.O.C. employees is not great at present.(12) Direct contact has been maintained with the Soviet Embassy in Tehran,which has undoubtedly financed and guided the Party and probably continues todo so.(13) There appears to be some liaison between the Tudeh and the IraqiCommunist groups (see Iraq M.E. 32/48).(14) The Power of the Tudeh is latent rather than overt. Under able leader-ship it will continue to make a strong appeal to the ill-fed, ill-clad masses, unlessGovernment social services are improved. Broadly speaking, however, the countryis strongly opposed to the idea of increased Soviet influence. This attitude hashardened as a result of the Russians&apos; behaviour in Azerbaijan. The Party&apos;sconnexion with the Soviet Union and the Governments hostility towards it are,therefore, the chief factors which prevent its further expansion.  Its influence has
certainly increased since the release of its leader last February, however, and itmust be regarded as a potentially powerful body; its chief danger to the Govern-ment lies in its ability to organise strikes.ETHIOPIAThere is no known Communist Party. Communist interest in, and possiblydirection of, the Somali Youth League (a Left-wing, nationalist organisation)has been reported, however, although there is no precise information on that subject. Membership of the Somali Youth League was reported as about 30,000in September 1947, which represents, very roughly, - 3 per cent, of the population.Communist propaganda is undoubtedly disseminated from the Soviet Lega-tion, but not to such an extent as to warrant special mention. A Russian hospitalin Addis Ababa, opened in September 1947, is likely to be an important channelfor Communist propaganda. Several favourable channels for Communist propa-ganda exist (e.g., the Left-wing elements in the Greek, Italian and ArmenianCommunities), apart from the Somali Youth League, and a deterioration in anglo-Ethiopian relations might well be exploited by the Russians as part oftheir policy of weakening British influence in Africa. So far, however, Com-communism as an ideology has made no appreciable headway, and the backwardness,illiteracy and feudal organisation of the masses would militate against anystartling Communist successes.TURKEYGeneral feeling in Turkey is extremely strong against communism. TheCommunist Party is illegal. The only Communist group suspected to exist is confined to a few intellectuals in large towns, who are vigorously and efficientlysuppressed by the police.ARGENTINA(I) The party was legalised in August 1945 after 15 years&apos; repression : itspresent position is uncertain, but precarious.(2) and (3) Strength of the Party. Its numbers are small : as a percentageof the population they are insignificant.(4)^(7) Voting Strength. It has no members in Parliament or in theGovernment. In national elections it put forward no candidates. In local elections it probably put forward no candidates.(8)-(10) The party has no influence in the armed forces or the police, and a negligible influence in the civil service.(II) It formerly exercised an appreciable influence in the trade unions,especially among construction workers, but all official unions are now Perbnistacontrolled, and it is unlikely that the Communists have found much opportunityto proselytise.(12) Contacts between Communist Party leaders and the Soviet Unionprobably do not exist, except possibly through Uruguay. There have been anumber of associations of Slav immigrants which are closely watched.(14) Its potentialities as a fifth-column are at present negligible.BOLIVIA(l)-(3) The P.I.R. (Left-wing Revolutionary Party) includes the BolivianCommunists. A Communist Party was formed in 1946, but it was merely aGovernment-sponsored device for splitting the P.I.R. : it appears to havecollapsed. P.I.R.&apos;s total strength is about 15,000 members with perhaps 10,000more active sympathisers.(4)-(7) So far as is known there have been no separate Communist candidatesat elections. The P.I.R. formed a coalition with the Liberals at the last presi-dential election (1947) and their candidate lost by a very narrow margin : about87,000 votes were cast. In the elections for Congress, the P.I.R. obtained 35 seatsout of 111 in the Chamber of Deputies.  Their leader, Dr. Arze, and their former
leader, Dr. Rieardo Araya, are fellow travellers, if not Communists: it is not known if any of the other deputies are genuine Communists.(11) As is usual in Latin America, the main appeal of communism is throughworkers&apos; organisations. The Confederation of Bolivian Workers claimed25,000 members in 1945, but it is not very active in the C.T.A.L.(13) Dr. Arze is in contact with the Chilean and Peruvian Communistleaders : he also visited Europe in 1947.(14) The Bolivian Communists might cause trouble in the mines, but atpresent other demagogues have priority.BRAZIL(1) The Brazilian Communist Party (P.C.B.) was declared illegal in 1935,went underground, was legalised in 1945, and became illegal again in May 1947.Its deputies were deprived of their seats in January 1948.(2)-(4) It probably never exceeded 25,000 members, though its leader, LuisCarlos Prestes, declared that it increased from 4,000 members in 1945 to130,000 in 1946. The population is about 46 million and the electorate about million.(5) In 1945 it received about 500,000 votes and had 16 seats in the lower house out of 218, and one Senator out of 63. A second seat in the Senate waswon in February 1947, when the party also won about a third of the seats onthe Rio de Janeiro (Federal District) Council. The Communists gained theirlarge votes in 1945-47 largely because of the absence of any recognised SocialistParty.(8)-(ll) As usual, the principal source of strength of the Communists lay inthe labour movement. At one time it had cells in the army and civil service : steps have been taken to deal with this, but it is not known how effective they have been.The Communist influence in the trade unions was considerable; the government now control the running of the unions. While the illegalisation of the party has put a brake on open propaganda, Brazilian Communists still contrive to meet.(12) and (13) Luis Carlos Prestes has visited the U.S.S.R. and was recently reported to have taken refuge in Uruguay. It appears to be through Uruguaythat Brazilian Communists keep in touch with other Communists.(14) In case of emergency, the Brazilian Communists could possibly be verytroublesome : several recent reports of sabotage, which is ascribed to Communists,may not be without foundation.CENTRAL AMERICA(l)-(3) Communism was legal in Costa Rica till 1948, when the Communistschose the losing side in the civil war. In El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaraguathe Party is iUegal: in Guatemala no organised Communist Party is known to exist, though President Arevalo is accused of Communistic leanings.In Costa Rica Communism was confused with Socialism and the actualnumber of Communists is difficult to assess. In Salvador, Honduras and Guate-mala, it is non-existent except for one or two agitators : in Nicaragua very small but active from 1944 to 1946, when its leader was exiled, now energeticallyrepressed.(4)-(7) The Party has Parliamentary representation only in Costa Rica,where before the civil war the Vanguardia Popular (including Socialists, but Com-munist dominated) had 6 deputies out of 56. It has no members in CentralAmerican Governments.(8)-(ll) Only in Costa Rica has it any influence in the armed forces, police and civil service; it is not yet clear whether Communist influence in the tradeunions has been purged, as a result of defeat in the civil war. Elsewhere there isno organised Communism.(12) Contact with the Soviet Union is through Mexico.(14) Its potentiality as a fifth-column is negligible except in Costa Rica,where, despite defeat in the recent civil war, the Communists cannot be altogetherignored.
CHILE(l)-(3) The CommiumistJPairfiy was legalised in 1938, when it joined the popular Front: it is now discouraged. Its membership is not known, but the voting strength was about 60,000 ((March 1948) out of a total population of b\million and an electorate of aJhosmft 5TOBCMMI.(4)-(7) It has 16 deputies m&amp; off 147, and 5 senators out of 46. Owing to thesupport it gave President Gonzalez Y^dela in 1946, it was given 3 portfolios and became the first (and only)) Lathi Ameariean Communist Party to obtain Cabinetrepresentation.  The portfolios were last in 1947.(8)-(ll) The Chilean Cfaararanaisg; Party has cells in armed forces, profes-sions, coal and nitrate mines and agriculture. It has a wider penetration than other Latin American Commramisffc Parlies. The Government is endeavouring toreduce its influence, and the Pre^depft has warned public servants and others notto belong to it. The Chilean Federation: of Labour is split between communists and Socialists : the former piewissoslfj exercised disproportionate influence byoccupying strategic positions; they tare been to a considerable extent dislodged.(12) Contact with the Soviet TJbIoei is through Uruguay and Mexico.(14) The Chilean ComfflTrmisit Party has deep roots and can find plenty of opportunity for propaganda in mmsafefactory social conditions. Under theemergency laws, the Government fes the situation well in hand, but the ChileanCommunist Party cannot he mated omfc as a sabotage force.COLOMBIA(l)-(3) A Communist Party, or rather two Communist Parties, were legal atthe time of the Bogota upheaval in April 1948. Their combined strength, in July1947 was about 9,000 out of a popmJafion of 10 million.(4)-(6) Since 1947 the COTtppiraiisBs have had no Parliamentary representa-tion; in 1944 they had 5 deputies onfc off 125.(7) In 1944 the Communists palled! 30,000 votes (5 deputies);, in 1947 theypolled only 12,500. In Mmniopal efeetfons it is understood that they have 38seats throughout the country.(8)-(ll) In the army they fase little influence; in the civil service, someinfluence in the Ministries of CoxQ33seij?ieations and Public Works. They have had considerable influence over the Cdkamfolan Federation of Labour.(13) Contact with the Soviet Urnem-Is through Mexico.(14) Its influence in the calfieMs makes sabotage a possibility. The Bogotaupheaval suggests how easily a nsob can be led into acts of irresponsibledestruction.CUBA(l)-(3) The Communist Paniy is legaL Its membership is uncertain; votingstrength 130,000 out of a popnlatieiBi of 5 million.(4) Electorate about 2TMiffliirani; say 7 per cent. Communist.(5)-(6) It has 7 deputies out of 113: 3 senators out of 36; it has no members in the Government.(7) In 1944 it had 116,000 wfes, or just over 5 per cent, of the electorate.In 1948 its Presidential candidate fed 130,000 out of 1,870,000 votes cast.(11) The Cuban Communist Party owes its strength to its hold over the cuban Federation of Labour to wfeldi it was formerly paramount. This is saidto have been purged.(12)-(13) Leaders have visited Poland and U.S.S.R.; contact is also main-tained through Mexieo.(14) If Cuba lost its present prasperity, the situation might become serious.DOMUflCAM REPUBLICThere is no legal Communist Party, nor is there likely to be while GeneralTrujillo is in the saddle. There aee some Labour agitators, and it is possiblethat some of Trujilkrs political exiles have embraced Communism. But there isnone, or practically none, in iflfog oofflMry.
HAITIThe Communist Party was formed in February 1946 and dissolved in April1947. It had a maximum of 1,300 members during the electoral campaign of1946, but only 100 were militant.In 1947 President Estime appointed its leaders to diplomatic posts or gave them &quot;scholarships&quot; abroad.It has no known outside contacts, and its potentiality as a fifth-column is negligible.MEXICO(l)-(7) The Communist Party is legal, but its actual membership is uncertain;it was only 3,000 in 1943, but had reached 17,000 between 1938 and 1940, out ofa population of 22 million. It has put forward no separate candidates and isnot represented in Parliament.(8)-(ll) The main strength of Mexican Communists lies in labour circlesand &quot; intellectuals.&quot; The Confederation of Mexican Labour was the point of departure for the Latin American Confederation of Labour led by Sr. V.Lombardo Toledano: this is pro-Communist, as is Lombardo Toledano&apos;s&quot; Worker&apos;s University.&quot; The Mexican Government has now withdrawn its support and the Confederation appears to be losing ground rapidly.(12)-(13) It has contact with the Soviet Union, which appears to be afavourite ground for exchanges between other Latin American and Spanish Com-munists in Moscow.(14) Its potentialities as a fifth-column are not very considerable.PANAMA(l)-(7) The Communists are not legally recognised as a political party, butCommunism is not illegal. The membership of the party is not known : estimated as 500 : it has voted with the Socialists. One member of the Constituent Assemblyof 1945, elected as a Socialist, was a Communist.   (Population 630,000 in 1940.)(8)-(ll) Apparently there is no considerable penetration of the services,except in labour circles, though its agitators succeeded in inducing students and workers to demonstrate with sufficient effect to make the Government reject theagreement with the United States on the leasing of bases (end of 1947). TheFederation of Panamanian Workers is partially led by Communists, as is theUnited Public Workers&apos; Union.(12)-(13) It is not known what contact the Party has with Moscow or otherneighbouring Communists; if any exists it is probably with Mexico.(14) While Communists in Panama are not strong, it is obvious fromPanama&apos;s strategic position that a small force could do great damage.PARAGUAYThe Communist Party was legal from August 1946 to January 1947. Sincefighting on the losing side in the late civil war, it has been suppressed: someattempts have been made to reorganise it, with what degree of success, if any, isnot known. It is now illegal. Its actual membership is unknown, but is certainlysmall.Before the civil war in 1947, it controlled the Workers&apos; Council with perhaps50,000 members.PERU(I) The Communist Party was legalised in May 1945. Its strength was esti-mated at 25,000 at the end of 1945, out of an electorate of 570,000. (Populationabout 1\ million.)(4)-(7) It returned one deputy in 1939; five in 1945 out of 137; no senators.In 1945 it polled about 30,000 votes.(II) As in the rest of Latin America, its strength is derived from its influence over the trade unions.  But at the end of 1947 the Peruvian-Cuban Federation
split from the C.T.A.L. on the grounds that the latter was Communist-controlled.Communism is actively combated in Peru by the large Socialist Party, A.P.R.A.(12) Contact with Soviet Russia is through Chile or Mexico.(14) Its potentiality as a fifth-column is not very considerable : influenceamong dockers at Callao has been strong.URUGUAY(l)-(7) The Communist Party is legal; its actual strength is unknown, butit received 14,300 votes in 1942, and 32,630 in 1946, out of a poll of 670,000(say, 5 per cent). It has five seats out of ninety-nine in the Chamber of Deputies;one Senator out of thirty; no representation in the Government. (Population2,150,000.)(11) The Communists derive most of their strength from the labour move-ment; the General Union of Workers is thoroughly penetrated.(12)-(13) There are contacts with neighbouring countries, and with Mexico;possibly with U.S.S.R.(14) Sabotage is a possibility.VENEZUELA(l)-(7) The Communist Party was legalised in October 1945. Its actualmembership is unknown; it controls about 55,000 votes in an electorate of 1,620,000(say, 5 per cent.). In 1946 Communists had two seats in Congress out of 160.(Population 4 million.)(8)-(ll) The Communists consist of &quot; intellectuals &quot; and oilfield workers :there may be some penetration into the civil service, but the hard core is in thelabour movement.(12) Contact with the Soviet Union is through Mexico, probably.(14) The oilfields are of great strategic importance, and sabotage cannotbe ruled out.BURMA(1) There are two Communist Parties-(a) the Burma Communist Party, led by Than Tun, which is legal althoughcertain of. the activities have been declared illegal; and(b) the Communist Party (Burma), led by Thakin Soe, which hived off fromthe original party in February 1946; the grounds of difference were largely personal, though also Soe was more disposed to violence thanThan Tun.(2) (a) The Burma Communist Party membership is probably about 4,000,spread throughout the country and carefully organised into district, townshipand village committees; but the membership of affiliated organisations is considerably more, viz. : Ail-Burma Peasants&apos; Union claims a membership of 300,000; thoughprobably this is double the true figure, the Union has enabled B.C.P. influence to dominate the country from Pegu to Mandalay and also considerable areasof the Irrawaddy Delta.Democratic Peoples&apos; Youth League, which is the former Red Guardunder another name, the new designation being a means of circumventingGovernment orders relating to Military organisations, has a strength of&quot;about 20,000.All-Burma Women&apos;s Congress is closely connected with the B.C.P. butthe size of its membership is not known.Rangoon University Students&apos; Union is not strictly controlled by theB.C.P. but many of its members are sympathetic to Communism.All-Burma Students&apos; Union is affiliated to the Communist-controlledInternational Union of Students.(b) The Communist Party (Burma) has ceased to be an effective organisationand its membership appears now to be negligible.35883 &quot; E
(3) The strict Party membership of the Burma Communist Party is about -25 per cent, of the total population.(4) Final figures for the last elections have not been made public, but itis estimated that less than 10 per cent, of votes cast were given to the Communists.(5) Six Communists were elected in 1947 2-9 per cent, of the total members.The number of fellow-travellers is not known.(6) It has no members in the national Government, but undoubtedly someof the Ministers are sympathetic to Communist ideas.(7) For votes recorded in recent elections, see (4) above.(8) The new Burma Army contains a large proportion of personnel taken over from the late Aung San&apos;s private army, and there is a strong leftist tendency in this element. Of the five infantry battalions composed mainly of this type,four are reported to be at least half-hearted in regard to the present operations against the Communists. When the Communist insurrection began in March1948, 200 officers and men were detained on charges of being implicated, but most have since been released. In addition, 6 officers and 20 men deserted withtheir arms. The remaining battalions 2 Chin, 3 Karen, 2 Kachin and2 Burman are said to be dependable. No information about Communists in theNavy or Air Force is available.(9) When action was taken against the Communists in March 1948, there weredoubts, whether the Police would prove reliable; some desertions did occur, butin general the fears proved unfounded, and it would appear that Communismhas little influence in the Police.(10) Communism makes little appeal to the higher of the Civil Service gradeswhich, in general, are opposed to the disorders which the Communists havefomented; but there is a good deal of sympathy with the Communists among the ill-paid clerical grades.   Numerical estimates are not available.(ll) The Trade Union movement is in its infancy. The Communist-controlled All-Burma Trade Union Congress comprises only about 2,000 workers,divided among ten unions, all in the Rangoon area.- (12) There are no known contacts between its leaders and Soviet Russia.(13) (a) Communication by letter and exchange of literature goes on withthe C.Ps. of Malaya, Geneva, Australia, Poland, Belgrade, Hungary, Belgium,Canada, Cyprus, Paris and Cape Town.(b) H. N. Goshal (alias Ba Tin), a Burma-born Indian, is the link withthe Communist Party of India; it is probable that the Burma CP. receives muchadviCfe and instruction from the C.P.I. Leading Burma Communists attended the C.P.I. conference in Calcutta in February 1948.   ;(c) There has been correspondence between the almost-defunct CommunistParty (Burma) and the Viet Nam News Service agent in Bangkok.&apos;&quot; !i (d) Miss Brickman, the English Communist; Dusan Puhalo, from Yugoslavia;and Sen Shiu Hwa from China; visited Burma after the&quot;C.P.I. conference in Calcutta this year.[e) In 1945 Communists in the British re-occupation forces made contact with: Burma Communists and gave them, much assistance and advice in organisa-tion, &amp;c, and Communism in Burma owes much of its vitality to this regrettableepisode. The connection has no doubt been maintained. Members of the BurmaC.P.&apos;attended the British Empire Communist Conference in London in March1947.(/.) The B.C.P. leader Than Tun recently advocated co-operation with theChinese Communists; this could be effected through Communists amongst theChinese community in Burma.(14) Communists in Burma could do great damage by way of sabotage of communications always easy in a relatively undeveloped country and byinfiltration into the armed forces.SIAMIn 1946 the law banning Communism was repealed, and there was recentlya Communist Party consisting of one man only. The Chinese Communist Party,however, is active among the Chinese in Siam and probably has a membership of2,000, representing 0-3 per cent, of the Chinese population.   In Bangkok, where
most Chinese congregate, they could do much harm by way of sabotage; they appear to have no influence in the armed forces, the police or the civil service,however. The Chinese Communists are an offshoot of the party in China andappear to be in touch with Chinese Communists throughout South-East Asia.Malayan Communists have recently been encouraging recalcitrants in SouthernSiam.FRENCH INDOCHINA(I) There is a Communist Party, but it is not legal so far as the french authorities are concerned.There is a state of civil war between the French and Vietminh, which is largely dominated by local Communists.(2) Actual party membership is reported to be 4,000.There are numerous affiliated peasants, whose numbers are not known but probably amount to some hundreds of thousands.In addition the Chinese Communist Party probably numbers about 5,000.(3) Of the total population of French Indo-China, the local Communistsamount to 1-017 per cent, but of the total population of Vietnam (i.e., Indo-Chinaless Cambodia and Laos) about 0-021 per cent.(4) No general electorate exists in French Indo-Chiha.(5, 7) There is no national Parliament.(6) There are no Communists in the Provisional Central Government, butsix of the members of the rebel Vietminh Administration are Communists.(8) The Vietminh army, which is controlled by a Communist commander,numbers about 40,000.There is no evidence of Communism among the French forces.(9) Outside the towns controlled by the French, such police as still exist are said to be largely controlled by the Communists.(10) There is a Leftist tendency among the indigenous members of the civilservice, but it is not possible to estimate how many are Communists.(II) There is little trade union activity.(12) The Vietminh leader, Ho Chi-minh, has visited Russia on more thanone occasion; he also worked with Borodin in China and was connected withBorodin&apos;s school for revolutionaries at Whampoa, near Canton.Other Vietminh leaders have similar records.(13) There is close contact with the Communists of China and, via Bangkok,with those of Burma.(14) If circumstances arose under which a fifth-column could operate,Communism in Indo-China would be extremely dangerous; but the prospect is rather that the extremists will openly dominate the country.INDONESIA(1) Is there a legal Communist Party ? The Communist Party is illegal inDutch-held teritory, but is recognised by the Indonesian Republican Government.(2) What is its actual membership f-Estimates have varied enormouslyfrom as little as 2,000 to as much as 125,000 (including 25,000 Chinese); thehigher figure, derived from Dutch sources, is certainly exaggerated.(3) What is its percentage of the total population? Taking the maximum of 125,000, the percentage is 0-18.(4) What is its percentage of the electorate f No electorate has been defined.(5) Has it members in the National Parliament and what percentage f no information.(6) Has it members in the National Government ?-None in the Dutchadministration and none in the Republican Government, but some of the35883 v 9     &apos;
Republican leaders have had Russian contacts in the past: thus Dr. Hatta, nowRepublican Prime Minister, attended the School for Revolutionaries in Tashkent,though he is not, now, a Communist.The Republican Partai Demokrat Rajkat, the Partai Boeroeh Demokrasi(Indonesian Workers&apos; Party) and the Front Demokrasi Rajkat are sympathetic to Communist ideas and have influence over the Government. The Partai Kom-munis Indonesia&apos;s leaders, such as Alimin, are certainly regarded with highrespect in Republican Government circles.(7) What votes has ii recorded in recent elections, national or local ? Therehave been no elections.(8) What is the extent of its influence in the armed forces f There is no evidence of infiltration into the Dutch forces, but Communism is said by the Dutchto be strong in the Republican Army; statistical data are not available.(9) What is the extent of its influence in the Police f No reliable evidence is available.(10) What is the extent of its influence in the Civil Service f No evidence is available.(11) What is the extent of its influence in the Trade Unions f Accordingto Dutch reports (which tend to describe all nationalist organisations as Com-munist) the Sobsi (central organisation of labourers in the Republic) and theSarboepri (organisation of agricultural unions in the Republic) are dominated by Communists; these two organisations control some 2,500,000 workers.(12) Are there any known contacts between its leaders and Soviet Russia ? -The veteran leader Alimin has visited Russia, whence he is said to have returnedas recently as 1946. The rival leader, Tan Malakka, visited Russia about twenty years ago; he is, however, a Trotskyist and probably has now no Russianconnections.There has been contact with the Russians through Soeripno, the Republicanrepresentative in Prague.(13) Are there any known contacts between its leaders and Communists in neighbouring countries t The Sobsi conference in 1947 is said to have beenattended by Australian Communists; Communist literature is obtained from australia.There is contact with the Communist Party of Malaya, and one line ofcommunication with Moscow is said, by the Dutch, to run through Singapore.The Malayan Nationalist leader, Boerhamoeddin, is said by the Dutch to be intouch with Alimin, and the Communist leaders in Sumatra are said to receiveinstructions through Md. Samin Taib, a Moscow-trained Malayan Communist.Propaganda material is said to reach Indonesia through Penang and throughthe Philippines.The Dutch say that the Indonesian Communists maintain contact with Russiathrough Dr. Soedarsono, Republican representative in New Delhi, and also bymeans of wireless.The Dutch state that Communists in the British forces of occupation didmuch to encourage Communism in the Indies, and in view of what happened in burma this may be so. It is thus probable that correspondence is carriedon between Communists in Indonesia and Communists in Great Britain.(14) What are its potentialities as a fifth-column ? Though the Dutch issuealarmist reports about the strength of Communism in the Indies, it appearsthat so far it has made little appeal. The powerful Masjoemi Party (the MuslimParty) is anti-Communist, and this is the dominant party in most of the republican territory. Communism has little grip ouside some of the towns, andits potentialities for mischief appear to be slight. It is, however, possible thatthe collapse of Republican ambitions for an independent Republic of all Indo-nesia may drive some influential Nationalists into the Communist camp through a sense of frustration; in that event, Communism might be a real danger as a fifth-column.CHINA(1) There is no legal Communist Party. The Chinese Government is engagedin a civil war against the Communist Party, which they formally outlawed on 4th July, 1947.
(2) Groups were formed in 1918-19 to study the Marxist school of thought and these expanded into Socialist societies which in their turn led to the foundingin Shanghai of the Chinese Communist Party in July 1921. Branches of theChinese Communist Party are active throughout South East Asia; while, in Chinaitself, the Party is by no means confined to the Communist-controlled areas butoperates in varying degrees of strength throughout the country.In 1937, it was claimed that the Chinese Communist army numbered 100,000and that there were 12,000 fully trained civilian members of the Party to tendthe needs of the &quot; millions of peasants.&quot;In 1947 the strength of the Communist Army was estimated to be between1,200,000 and 2 million, and of the Communist Party, as distinct from the army at about 2,700,000.The Weekly Bulletin of the New China News Agency of 6th July, 1948, statesthat the &quot; Chinese Communist Party numbers 3 million.&quot;(3) No reliable census of the Chinese population has ever been taken. U.N.O.,however, has accepted 461 million as a convenient figure to work on.The Communist Party would, therefore, be about \ per cent, of the totalChinese population; and the Party plus Army would be approximately 1 percent.The Communists claim that in the summer of 1948 they control &apos;&apos; liberatedterritory &quot; harbouring one-third of the total population of China.(4) The Party has been outlawed and forms no part of the electorate.(5) It has no members in the National Parliament, but in the national assembly the presence of &quot; fellow travellers&quot; is not beyond the realm of possibility.(6) It has no members in the National Government, so far as the Governmentare aware.(7) It has recorded no votes in recent elections, national or local.(8) The strength of the Communist Army, which is engaged in a war withthe Central Government, is estimated to be between 1,300,000 and 2 million thelatter is the most recent figure given as its strength in 1947.There are no known Communists in the National Army, but there is doubtlessa fifth-column at work. The Communist Party have had some success from timeto time in enticing Central Government forces to their banner. It does not neces-sariiy follow that this is the result of fifth-column work, but, on the other hand,there is surprisingly little evidence to show that Nationalist Commanders havebeen bought with hard cash. The low state of morale which has existed amongNationalist forces for some considerable time may, of course, be solely responsible.(9) There are no known Communists in the Central Government Police Force.(10) There are no confessed Communists in Government employ.(11) Generally speaking, the trade unions in Central Government-controlledareas are anti-Communist. They are regulated by the National Government TradeUnion Act first promulgated in 1929 and amended several times, the last being in1947, when the right to strike was restored. Naturally, the trade unions in Govern-ment-controlled areas are not without their quota of Communist sympathisers;but to what extent Communist penetration of labour unions in Government-con-trolled areas has occurred is difficult to gauge. The eyes of the Government,through the Secret Police, are sharp. But it is of interest to note that ChuHseuh-fan, who from 1932 until recently was a member of the Legislative Yuan,President of the Chinese Association of Labour from 1939 to 1947, and who hasattended several sessions of the International Labour Congress as the ChineseWorkers&apos; Delegate, is now President of the Chinese Federation of Labour and amember of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee in Hong Kong, which he now finds a more convenient place of residence than China. He is reported tohave toured Manchuria very recently and to have written an article in praise ofindustrial, mining and agricultural conditions there.In Manchuria and all Communist-controlled areas it follows that all labour organisations are completely Communist.(12) Russia has always been, and still is the spiritual home of the chinese communist Party. Most of the leaders of the C.C.P. are Russian educated andindoctrinated. Mao Tze-tung, the leader of the Yenan or &quot; Old CommunistGroup &quot; in his catch slogan of &quot; China for the Chinese &quot; makes great capital ofthe claim that he was not trained abroad.  But Mao was in Moscow in 1935, where
he attended the last Congress of the Third International, and he remained onthe Executive Committee of the Comintern until its dissolution in 1943. Alsoboth his sons were educated in the Soviet Union but then so was the son 6&apos;fChiang Kai-shek.Li Li-san, the leader of the &quot; New Communist Group &quot; now in Harbin, hasspent many years in Russia. He is married to a lady of Sqviet nationality with,it is reported, considerable influence in Moscow. He is certainly in contact withthe U.S.S.R. and is said to find favour with the military members of the RussianMission in Harbin.During the World War two Russian journalists and one Russian doctor wereresident in Yenan. The two former were Tass agents, but it is thought that alithree were almost certainly &quot; contact men.&quot;There is no evidence of the Chinese Communist Party being hi receipt offinancial help or supplies of military arms or equipment from the U.S.S.R., norof there being any Russian advisers, military leaders, or instructors, in theirmidst.  But the Chinese Communist military instructors are Russian trained.Illustrations of the relationship between the Chinese Communist Party and moscow are provided by the behaviour of the U.S.S.R. forces in Manchuria inpermitting the Chinese Communist forces then made up of a large proportionof bandits, Communists in nothing but name to follow in their wake in 1945and help themselves to the enormous supplies of arms and equipment left by theJapanese; in timing their withdrawal so as. to enable the Chinese CommunistArmy and not the Nationalist forces to take over the Manchurian cities; and theattitude of the U.S.S.R. over the ports of Dairen and Port Arthur more particu-larly the former. Reports state that, to make certain of having their friends in control should they have to go through the formality of returning Dairen to china, the Soviets are indoctrinating and training Chinese for the responsibleposts in the local Government.(13) Nozaka, now a leader of the Communist Party in Japan, spent a numberof years in China under the name of Okano. There is some doubt whether heowes his political views to China or to Russia, where he was before his stay inChina. He got on particularly well with the Chinese Communist leaders andit is a safe guess that he still retains his contact with them.In the Northern Section of Korea there is definite contact between the Koreanand Chinese Communist Parties.It is reported that the son of Mao Tze-tung, acting on behalf of the ChfneseCommunist Party, recently signed a pact of mutual assistance with the Com-munist Party in North Korea, the Vice-President of the Korean Communistssigning for his Party. This pact, which was signed at Pyongyang, the Sovietcapital in North Korea, is reported to have been drafted by the Soviet union and to provide for mutual military assistance and the exchange of certain food-stuffs and essential commodities.In the Southern Section of Korea there does not appear to be direct contact between the Chinese and Korean Communist leaders, but it would be surprisingif no contact existed, more especially since Japanese Communists and Koreansin Japan maintain contact with Dairen.Chinese Communists are active in the Philippines, Singapore, Malaya, Siamand Burma- in fact, throughout S.E. Asia.With India, too, it is probable that contact is still maintained. That therehas been contact is shown in the book, &apos;&apos; Revolution and Counter-Revolution inChina,&quot; by the Indian Communist, M. N. Roy.Toward the end of February 1948 representatives of the Chinese CommunistParty participated in a Conference held at Calcutta which was also attended by representatives of thirteen other countries (Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Yugo-slavia, United Kingdom, France, Australia, India, Pakistan, Viet Nam, Indo-nesia, Ceylon, Malaya and Burma).In the United Kingdom Mr. Michael Lindsay is in contact with the chinese communist Party.In its early days the Chinese Communist Party was largely built up amongChinese students abroad in France and Germany in particular and it isprobable that contact exists to-day between the Chinese Communist leaders andCommunists in most countries of Europe.Chinese Communists are known to. be visiting&apos; neighbouring countries,including Burma and India, for the purpose of stirring up armed rebellion; while&apos;from Harbin Li Li-san, a clever and Russian-trained organiser, is known tobe making a determined endeavour to strengthen the contacts between the chinese communist Party and international groups.   Li Li-san is thought to be out
of patience with the more cautious tactics of the Yenan leader, Mao Tse-tung.Nevertheless, in his report to the Chinese Communist Party on Christmas Day,1947, which has caused World-wide comment, Mao Tse-tung himself urged thelinking of democratic China with the &quot; Colonial, or partly Colonial &quot; countries of the world. In the same address Mao also made it clear that contact betweenthe Chinese and Burmese Communist Parties was being sought. Finally, the address called upon all of the several countries in the East to unite in getting ridonce and for all of the oppression from &quot; Imperialist&quot; countries.The Democratic League, which has its headquarters in the Colony of Hong-kong, and which has recently given out its intention to establish the closestrelationship with the Chinese Communist Party, is particularly active throughoutSouth-East Asia.(14) Its potentialities as a fifth-column are probably small in relation to openexternal aggression. However much the Chinese Communist leaders may rely onthe Soviet Union for &quot;advice,&quot; however much they are, in fact, dominated bythat country, the proud cry of the Chinese Communist Party-and probably thesincere belief of the rank and file is that they are Chinese first and foremostand recognise no external allegiance. .In internal relations the civil war the fifth-column potentialities of theChinese Communist Party are enormous.The Nationalist march from Canton to the Yangtsze in 1927 owes its speed and easy victory entirely to the fifth-column organisation of Communist cellswhich had already prepared the way. Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s easy capture ofShanghai with little or no fighting was made possible by the fifth-column workof his friends of the underworld of that city, who co-operated with the Com-munist cells planted in the factories by Li Li-san during his earlier organisationof the &quot; Shanghai Incident &quot; (30th May, 1925). The Communist disaster andmassacre at Changsha in July 1930 was admitted by their leaders to be directlydue to their failure to establish advance contacts with the &quot;workers&quot; in thatcity.  They learnt their lesson.In the early days of the Nationalist movement in China, trade and studentunions were instruments of the Communists and did much to further the initialsuccess of the revolution. Communist cells, once planted, are seldom eradicated;Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s purges served to drive them underground, but not to destroythem. Present-day events afford every indication that there exist fifth-columnorganisations in Nationalist-controlled territory, and that these organisations are increasing in influence among the student fraternity, the factory hands in thelarger cities, among the growing bands of brigands in South China, and finally,but perhaps most important of all, among the members of the extreme Left-wingand dissident elements within the Kuomintang Party itself, working for the mostpart from the shelter of Hongkong. These latter are the more dangerous in thatthey are not actually Communists -in fact, outwardly anti-Communist but rather fellow-travellers susceptible of combining with the Communists for the overthrow of the Central Government. These, possible quite unwittingly, providethe Communists with a highly valuable potential fifth-column.SOUTH KOREA(1) There is a legal Communist Party in South Korea, but, owing to theapprobrium which its actions have brought upon it, it has changed its name tothe &quot; South Korean Labour Party.&quot;(2) The Party consists of : (a) Agents of the &quot; North Korean Labour PaHy &quot; or of the Russians, somesent from the north, others recruited locally.(6) Their paid supporters.   Crowds at Leftish demonstrations have been paid at the rate of yen 200 per head for one attendance.(c) Volunteers who hope to increase their power by supporting the Party.(d) Convinced Communists.The excesses committed by the Party have reduced this last category tonegligible dimensions. The other groups are variable in size, especially the paidsupporters. In May this year more than 80 per cent, of the electorate voted fornon-Communists. The remainder of the electorate included supporters of the left and Centre parties (who boycotted the election) besides those who were unable or too indifferent to vote.   The Communist supporters were also among
those who did not vote and thus clearly formed an extremely small proportion ofthe electorate at that time, almost certainly less than 5 per cent, and possiblyless than 1 per cent.*(3) See under (2) above. The Communist proportion of the total population is probably less than 3 per cent, and possibly less than 0-7 per cent.(4) See under (2) above. The Communist proportion of the electorate is lessthan 5 per cent, and possibly less than 1 per cent.(5) There are no overt Communists in the new South Korea elected Assembly.(6) This Assembly will not appoint Communists to the Government when it is formed.(7) Figures for Communists in local councils are not available.(8) South Korea has not yet organised its armed forces.(9) Some sections of the police have shown themselves to be devoted toRight-wing politicians and they are generally opposed to the Communists, with whom they have had many fights. A recent report, however, states that evidencenow exists of Communist infiltration into the police.(10) Figures for Communists in the administration are not available.(11) In the Trade Unions the Communists have been active and have succeeded in imposing themselves on a number of factories. The Right-wing has done the same and is believed to control rather more workers than the Communists. Thelatter have used their power almost entirely for political and subversive purposes,causing riots in Seoul and other towns as well as on the railways. Owing to theagricultural nature of South Korea the effectiveness of these tactics has been limited.(12) The leader of the South Korean Labour Party lives in North Korea tomaintain better contact with his Korean and Russian masters as well as forhis own safety.One of the major plots in South Korea was organised by M. Shabshin,director of the Political Department of Soviet Headquarters in North Korea,while he was a guest in the American Zone as a member of the Soviet delegation to the Joint Commission.(13) Contact with Chinese Communists is via North Korea.(14) The only weakness of this Party as a fifth-column in South Korea lies in the antipathy it has aroused among the local population. Its greatest successso far has been in Quelpart Island (Korean Cheju, Japanese Saishu) where inMay rioters succeeded in upsetting the elections in two of the three electoraldistricts. It is doubtless no mere coincidence that the only two districts in whichCommunists were strong enough to achieve this were in an island of great strategicvalue to Russia.JAPAN(1) There is a legal Communist Party in Japan. It was banned before thewar, but was reborn in 1945 when General Mac Arthur ordered the release ofpolitical prisoners in Japan.(2) Its membership is reported to be : Registered members   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      16,200Secret members ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 300Adherents        ..................      80,000Total ..................      96,500A recent report from The Observer, however, quoted the Chairman, Tokuda,for the figure of 120,000, Nozaka, the second leader, for 100,000, and &quot; impartialsources &quot; for 30,000.(3) Taking membership at 96,500 and population at 78-5 million, the communists form 0 12 per cent, of the population.* The only figures available for Party strengths in South Korea are those supplied by theparties. Their total much exceeds the total population, and the Communists&apos; figures are atleast as unreliable as those of other parties.
(4) Taking the electorate at 38 - 34 million, the Communists form 0-25 of the electorate.(5) There are 4 Communist members in each house of the Diet. In the Houseof Councillors this is 1 - 6 per cent., in the House of Representatives 0 - 86 per cent.(6) There are no Communists in the Cabinet.(7) In the House of Representatives election in 1947 the Communists obtained3-4 per cent, of the votes; in the local elections (same electorate) 1 per cent.The electors show less enthusiasm for Communists whom they know than fortheir programme. In the Diet elections, for which the electoral districts arelarge, the Communists benefited by the comparative lack of personal contact withtheir constituents.(8) There are no Japanese armed forces.(9) Communist influence in the police seems slight.(10) Communist influence in the Civil Service is exerted through the various government workers&apos; trade union organisations.(11) In Japan the National Congress of Industrial Unions (N.C.I.U.) orOrganisations (N.C.I.O.) claims to represent 1-7 million workers and is thelargest federation of Trade Unions in the country., Its chief rival is the JapanFederation of Labour (J.F.L.) though a number of Unions, representing morethan 3 million workers, retain their independence of these two organisations.The Communists have since the beginning of the movement in 1945-46 concen-trated on obtaining control of the N.C.I.U. through &quot; fractional &quot; tactics. they now hold 30 out of 49 seats in its Executive Committee, besides dominant positions in the more important member unions, including those of Government employees.The J.F.L. in general remains steady in its allegiance to the Social-Democrats.On 14th February, 1948, the vice-chairman of the N.C.I.U. essayed to forman anti-Communist &apos;&apos; Democratisation League &apos;&apos; within the organisation to defend the vague Socialist aspirations of the rank and file against Communist dominationfrom on top. The Times of 21st February reported that the Executive Committeehad immediately repudiated the League and succeeded in forcing the resignation of its promoters. It appears to have continued to exist within some of the Unionscomposing the N.C.I.U., but suffered a further set-back in the Electrical Equip-ment Workers&apos; Union, its chief stronghold, on 17th April when Communistssecured the Chairmanship and Secretaryship of that Union.Despite their very strong and indeed controlling position in the N.C.I.U.,the Communists are unable to influence politics after the manner of those inFrance, since they notably lack popular support, even among the workers, andthey might easily forfeit their positions were they to provoke further opposition of the type of the &quot; Democratisation League.&quot; For the moment they concentrate on organising economic discontent into strike waves within the limits imposed by the occupation. The artificial element in these tides is apparent in that,unlike the North Sea of Canute, they check and recede obedient to MacArthur&apos;command each time he judges that they have risen too far.(12) Only one of the three most prominent leaders and seven in a recentlist of 52 headquarters officials of the Japan Communist Party, have resided inthe Soviet Union.Present contacts are maintained with the &apos;&apos; League of Koreans Residing in japan,&quot; which is dominated by Korean Communists, and through them withNorth Korea and Dairen, both under direct Soviet control. These overseascontacts are important for the organisation of smuggling, the proceeds of which appear to form an important source of funds for the Party in Japan.Similar, but more direct, contacts appear to exist between Hokkaido, wherethe Party is fairly strong and enjoys a semi-independent organisation, and theRussian occupied Kurile Islands and Sakhalin across the narrow straits ofNemuro and Soya.Contact is also maintained, though its degree of closeness is not accuratelyknown, with the Russian mission in Tokyo.   This mission numbers 230 persons.The existence of a cleavage of sentiment among Japanese Communistssuggests that for the moment Soviet policy is not crystallised in their regard.The Nozaka faction appear more suave and compromising, the Tokuda factionmore orthodox and uncouth. Both, however, obey the orders of the centralcommittees and their co-existence keeps open two lines of emotional attack in japan between which the Russians may choose as opportunity suggests. Nozaka35883 ^        p
has lived in Moscow, Tokuda has not. Other headquarters officials who havelived there are equally divided between the two groups.(13) Contact with Korean Communists is mentioned above. Contact withthose of China is maintained through Dairen (see also above), Nozaka, who-was in Yenan during the recent war, is in himself a further link with ChineseCommunism.(14) Except in Hokkaido, where the population is sparse and Russianterritory is but twenty kilometres from the Japanese coast, Japanese Communismappears still too weak, too alien and too impecunious to form an effective fifth-column. The Koreans in Japan would better serve this purpose though theyare less well organised, less liked, and only number some 600,000. At leastthey are probably better armed than the Japanese.THE PHILIPPINES(1) The ban imposed in 1940 on the Communist Party of the Philippinesappears never to have been lifted. Since then the Communists seem to haveidentified themselves with the Hukbalahap and P.K.M. organisations, whichwere both in their turn declared illegal under President Roxas (died 15th April,1948). but which have been granted an amnesty by his successor, President Quirino.This amnesty was ratified on 25th June, conditional on the surrender of arms bythese organisations not later than 15th July. Pending reports on the successof the amnesty, the legal position of the majority of the agrarian Communistsympathisers remains in doubt.(2) Membership of the P.K.M. (National Peasants&apos; Union) is reported as150,000 and of the C.L.O. (Congress of Labour Organisations) as 80,000, butonly a proportion of these are Communists or even specifically Communistsympathisers.(3) Since the total population is 19 million, the Communists constitute lessthan 1 per cent. Sympathisers with the agrarian unrest led by the Hukbalahapsand to some extent influenced by the Communists may at times have amounted to10 per cent.(4) See the preceding paragraph.(5) The Democratic Alliance (an organisation of the &apos;&apos; Popular Front &apos;&apos; type,now defunct) won 6 seats out of. approximately 100 in the House of Repre-sentatives elections in 1945, but information is not available on whether anyof the six representatives were avowed Communists. Luis Ta-rUc, Commander-in-Chief of the Hukbalahap, finally took his seat &apos;on 25fch June, 1948, as aresult of the amnesty.- (6) There are no known Communists in the Government.-.* - (7) Figures of voting in recent elections are not available.(8) There are no known Communists in the Government forces, though thereare some American deserters in the Hukbalahap forces.(9) There are no known Communists in the Police.(10) There are no known Communists in the civil service.(11) The Philippines are not highly industrialised, but such Trade Unionsas there are are strongly influenced by the Communist-dominated Congress ofLabour Organisations. This, however, affects the city of Manila rather thanthe country as a whole.  Its membership is reported as 80,000.(12) Although Communist leaders in the Hukbalahap are reported to receivemoney from Russia, their chief sources of funds appear to be banditry, blackmail,the Chinese Communist and American Communist or Left-wing organisations, inthe order given.(13) The Chinese in the Philippines provide links with the Communists inChina. The American Merchant Marine is reported to bring $6,000 monthlyfrom the Communist Party in America, who also lend occasional public moral support to the agrarian revolutionaries in the islands.- (14) The Hukbalahap is a powerful, armed guerilla organisation formerlycontrolling some four rice-growing provinces north of Manila in central Luzon.
It was created to fight the Japanese, but has subsequently fought the Government.It resisted efficiently till this summer, though the range of its activity was slowlybeing narrowed. Its inspiration and strength were in the endemic agrarian unrest.Its arms were acquired from American wartime supplies to guerillas, and increased by captures from the Japanese and by other nefarious means. Someof its leaders were Communists and Communist experience was reflected in theform of the organisation. It is, however, doubtful whether the members wouldever have fought for any motive save their own profit or agrarian reform.Communist efforts to organise a United Front in politics had some successduring the war, but none thereafter. The more ambitious Democratic Alliancewhich followed showed less Communist influence in its leadership and organisa-tion; it has also dissolved.The latest organisation, the P.K.M., seems little more than a political counter-part to the Hukbaiahap forces, operating within the radius of Hukbalahapprotection. It has shown much Communist influence (its flag is red with a whitescythe and the letters &quot; P.K.M.&quot;) and it purports to.set up a complete systemof central and local government on semi-Communist lines.Among the semi-literate peasantry Communist political ideals are slow totake root, and the only ally on whom Russia might be able to rely within the philippines would seem to be the Hukbalahap. So long as the guerillas couldbe made to feel that they were fighting for their own interests against the usurersand grasping landlords they would be likely to accept alliance with, and someguidance from, the Communists. Under a threat of Russian or Chinese Com-munist domination their reactions would almost certainly be different. If therecent amnesty has in fact resulted in their effective disarmament, their value as a potential fif th-eolnnm will be small, though in compensation the opportunities for Communist infiltration into Government organisations will have been much increased.August, 1948.
