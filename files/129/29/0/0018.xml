(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENT)S E C R E T COPY NO.      tCP. (U8) 208&quot;25th August,  19U8,CABINETFINANCIAL AND COMMFRCIAL RELATIONS WITH JEWISH&quot;authorities memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe general lines of a future settlement for Palestineare still not clear.      Meanwhile, there are several particularquestions arising as regards commercial and financial dealings with the Jews on which it is. desirable to have an agreed andconsistent interim policy.      The most important of thesequestions are:-(1)    Whether we should take any further steps to securethe resumption of operations by the Haifa refinery and the delivery of crude oil to it through the pipeline from Iraq.(2)    Whether British oil companies should be authorised tosupply oil to the Jews pending the resumption of v/ork at Haifarefinery.(3)    Whether we should have any discussion with the Jewishfinancial authorities about future financial relations and, inparticular,  the disposal of the Palestine Governments assets,(k)    Whether we should release small quantities of sterlingfrom blocked Palestine accounts for the immediate needs of theJewish authorities.(5)   What our reaction should be to the issue of a newcurrency by the Jewish authorities in Palestine.(6)   Whether any citrus fruit should be bought from the    *J ews.recommendations we should in general seek to avoid discrimination between Arabs and Jews, and v/e should try to prevent either side profiting at the other&apos;s expense from the results of their military operations.      Subject to this there should be no barto normal commercial dealings.      Particular recommendations onthe above problems are:-(1)    No further steps should be token by us for the timebeing or by British oil companies to put pressure on either party with a view to the resumption of operations at Haifarefinery.
(2)    No official objection should be made if British oil companies wish to supply the Jewish authorities with refinedpetroleum products from outside the Middle East provided thatsuch deliveries are limited to normal peace-time requirements and that no opportunity is given for the accumulation of stocks which might be used for military purposes.      Such authority would be limited to British oil companies with establishedtrade in Palestine and should not exceed the previous share oftrade held by such companies.      In practice only Shell are involved on the British side and Standard/Vacuum on the UnitedStates side.(3)   No general financial discussions should be held withthe Jewish authorities at present, and no encouragement shouldbe given to the idea of the eventual inclusion of a Jewish state in the sterling area..     The disposal of the Palestine Government&apos;assets cannot be discussed until the future settlement ofPalestine has become clear*(h.) No large releases from blocked Palestine accountsshould be made without the prior approval of all theDepartments concerned. In discussing with representativesof the Jewish authorities how any funds to be released shouldbe spent, strict attention should be paid to the conditionswhich have been laid down(5)   We have no general reason to take any strong line with regard to the issue of new currency by the Jewishauthorities, but there are one or two points which will haveto be taken up with the Jews if and when,  at a later stage,we enter into discussion with them.     Meanwhile, the PalestineCurrency Board should continue its functions for the timebeing, and in particular, should pay sterling (in blockedaccounts) against surrender of the old Palestine currency Inaccordance with its existing obligations.(6)    Every effort should be made to purchase our citrusrequirements elsewhere than in Palestine.(7)   Finally it should be agreed that no decision on any economic or financial questions affecting our relations with theJewish authorities in Palestine should be taken without prior approval by all the Departments concerned, to be obtained throughthe Overseas Negotiations Committee..discussion in general I feel that it is necessary to proceedwith great caution in all these matters.      It appears fairlyclear that a Jewish state of some kind will form part of the eventual Palestine settlement, but the state which the Jewsnow claim to have set up still falls far short of the normalcriteria demanded for recognition, and the aggressivedeclarations of the Jewish leaders are not consistent with   - -their desire to be accepted as a member of the United Nations.If they succeeded in establishing their state we should haveto negotiate with them, on a number of questions including those mentioned above, but any undue haste on our part to do so wouldseem most Undesirable.      The Jews would interpret any suchaction as success for their aggressive policy and, in particular,for the excessive claims and irresponsible/actions of the extremists.      The Jews are still making violent denunciationsof His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s alleged lack of neutrality.They have shown no respect for British interests in theirunlawful operation of the refinery,  in their detention of a
British aircraft and. in the condonation of the Irgun&apos;s actionin seizing British subjects working under the aegis of the truce Commission and committing two of them for trial for offences allegedly committed in an area where the Jewish&amp;    authorities had not even claimed jurisdiction.      They havebeen putting all kinds of difficulties in the way of theBritish Consul-Genera1 in Haifa.      Apart from this, any sign ofa more forthcoming attitude on our part towards the Jews wouldconvince the Arabs that they have no more to hope from theWestern Powers and induce in them a dangerous mood of desperationin which the most unwise counsels might prevail.      Admittedlymost of the Arabs have not done much to deserve our continuedfriendship, but it is.always unwise to look for gratitude in international affairs and even the passive tolerance of theArabs continues to be of the greatest importance to us in viewof the national resources and strategical situation of the areasin which they live.      They will undoubtedly have great difficultyin accepting any Palestine settlement which can possibly emergein present circumstances.      The only hope of acquiescence lies inour retaining some of our influence.(1)   A detailed description of the present situation isgiven in the Annex.The Haifa refinery is not operating at present.      TheBritish company which owns the refinery, Consolidated Refineries,Ltd., is not in physical possession of the refinery and theJewish authorities have been operating it under their own control to refine small stocks of crude which were left in the tanks.As a result of these operations they have stocks of variousrefined products which will last about another one to threemonths according to the type of product.      The Iraq Governmentrefuse to allow crude to be pumped to Haifa so long as there isno full international control.      They maintain that no Iraqoil can go to the Jews.      The Jews are making efforts to obtaincargoes of crude from outside the Middle East in order tore-start the refinery.      They have not met with any success from american companies so far and the transport of crude from theWestern hemisphere to Haifa would be most uneconomical.      Suppliesof crude could theoretically be obtained from other Middle Eastsources (Persian Gulf) but it is almost certain that Egypt wouldmake very great difficulties about the transit of such suppliesthrough the Suez Canal.      It is understood that the Jews arealso making enquiries from Russian and Roumanian sources.      Theymay be able to obtain some cargoes from the Black Sea, but not enough to run the refinery at capacity for any length of time.Iraq oil continues to flow down the northern branchof the pipeline to Tripoli where some of it is refined at asmall refinery and the rest shipped as crude mainly to Europe.The stoppage of Haifa refinery means a loss ofrefining capacity of h million tons a year, about half of whichis normally used to supply countries outside the Middle East.Sooner or later some arrangement will hove to bereached by which pumping of Iraq crude is resumed,  someguarantee being given that refined products will be distributed&apos;   from Haifa in accordance with normal commercial practice andthat stocks are not built up as a reserve for war purposes.This would obviously be in the best interests of both the IraqGovernment, who are at present losing royalties, the Jews,  andthe British companies, but it seems most doubtful whether theJews would at present agree to the kind of international control which the Iraqis would.think sufficient.      This being so,  and
in the&quot;light of the very aggressive statements beingcontinually made by the Jewish authorities, it seemsundesirable that His Majesty&apos;s Government should becomedirectly or indirectly involved in negotiating arrangementsfor the resumption of work at the refinery,  since it isclear that hie should at some stage be asked to apply very severe pressure .to Iraq,  pressing them to agree to arrangements in which they did not have confidence and whichwe could not honestly recommend as meeting the dangers whichthey have in mind.      If we are pressed by the American orFrench Government, who also have interests in the pipeline,to take any.action, this will be a different matter, since we shall then be able to ask that they secure Jewish acceptanceof really satisfactory conditions before we approach the IraqGovernment, and we should not ourselves be in a position ofasking favours of the Jews..(2)    It is recommended that the British oil companies should be authorised to supply to the Jews by way of importsnormal quantities of refined products pending resumption ofwork at the refinery.      The immediate Jewish requirements are for one month&apos;s supply of herosene, gas/Diesel oil and furnaceoil.      Petrol is not immediately required.      If we refuse toallow these imports, we shall be accused of imposing oilsanctions on the Jews,  and they will be the more tempted to operate the refinery themselves with imported crude.      supplies are being distributed in Arab countries by British companies.(3)    Suggestions have been made by the Jewish authorities that they might send an official here to discuss general financial relations including the entry of the Jewish Stateinto the sterling area and the disposal of the PalestineGovernments assets.      These assets are held by us pendingtheir transfer to &quot;successor authorities&quot;.      In presentconditions the Jews cannot properly claim to be a successorauthority.      I understand that there would be no advantage on balance to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the inclusion of the&quot;Jewish State&quot; in the sterling area.      Discussions would therefore not be advisable at present.The Jews have also suggested that they might takeover holdings of Eastern European currencies which theyunderstand that we have in blocked accounts.      I understandthat we have no such holdings and,  in any case, it seems most undesirable that we should encourage or facilitate closer relations between the jews and Eastern Europe.(li)   when Palestine was removed from the sterling area the Palestine sterling accounts.were blocked.      Substantialreleases were made at the same time to provide for normal trade requirements up to 15th May (the end of the Mandate).Further releases were promised to pay for essential foodstuffsup to 30th June, as we had accepted some measure of obligationto procure foodstuffs for Palestine until that date.      In thestatement made on the exclusion of Palestine from the sterling area it was announced that our policy with- regard to futurereleases -would be discussed with the United Nations Commission(which however never functioned effectively).      In a further statement at the time of the termination of the Mandate itwas announced that while it was impossible at present to release further fixed amounts, His Majesty&apos;s Government would consider applications from banks for releases of reasonableamounts to meet essential payments in sterling.      On thestrength of this statement the Anglo-Palestine Bank havebeen informed that a sum not exceeding  3 millions can be.released for the purchase of essential foodstuffs,  subject
to certain conditions,  e.g. that all purchases should be inthe sterling area.      I feel strongly that releases of thiskind should not be made without the agreement of the ForeignOffice in view of the important political implications andof the changed political circumstances since the originalstatement wag made .      It is essential that no further releasesshould be made without proper inter-departmental co-ordination.(5)    We were not consulted by. the Jewish authoritiesabout the Issue of their new currency but they could not well have done so, -and in most respects the change is being madewith as little offence as possible.      The two respects inwhich we have cause of complaint are that the decision was founded in fact on alleged shortcomings of the PalestineCurrency Board (which we do not admit), and that provision is made for a sterling - United States dollar cross-rate of$3 to the  . for certain purposes.      The Palestine CurrencyBoard in London should continue its operations includingthe prompt payment in &quot;blocked sterling for old Palestinecurrency surrendered to it.The issue of new currency by TransJordan is to beexpected in the fairly near future.(6)    We normally &quot;buy about 9 million cases of citrusfruit from Palestine, half being bought from Jewish growersand half from Arab.      In present circumstances some 85%of the fruit growing areas are understood to be in Jewishcontrol and only 15)?* in the south, in Arab-held territory.The Arab inhabitants of the Jewish areas have almost all been driven out and it seems likely that many of the Arabproperties have been taken over by the Jews.      In thesecircumstances, if we are to buy from the Jews there will beno means of ensuring that they do not include in our purchasesa large amount of fruit which has come from properties owned by the Arabs, now in Jewish hands.     We should in fact becondoning the improper acquisition of these properties bythe Jews and enabling them to profit from their expulsion ofthe Arab inhabitants.     We are advised that any such action onour part would produce considerable indignation in the neighbouring Arab states and cause a further reduction in our influence there.I realise the necessity for some citrus imports andthe difficulty of using dollars to acquire them from theWestern hemisphere (even though the price would be less), butI understand that we can obtain at least a large part of our requirements from Spain, and there is a small exportable cropin the Lebanon.      If we can make full use of these and other sources,  it may be possible to avoid altogether the very-delicate situation in which we should &quot;be placed in dealing withJewish exporters, ana I would recommend that this should bedone.     We shall then not have to deal with Palestine untilthe respective rights of Arab and Jewish owners have been cleared up.      If our minimum essential requirements cannotbe met in this way and we have to buy from Palestine, we should confine our purchase to such an amount as can be equallydivided between Arab and Jewish suppliers,  (i.e.  some 30%of the normal purchase on the assumption that the Arabs willcontrol 15% of the crop),      Even then we should have to besure that the Arabs could actually deliver their -quota, since they may have considerable difficulties in packing andtransporting it.
(7)    The Cabinet5s ruling en these points will carry ussome distance, hut other slsllar questions will no doubt arise in the future and It Is essential that all Departments concerned should be properly consulted, before action is taken.      i suggest that this should, &quot;toe done through the overseas negotiations Committee.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W.1.25th August,
annex the HA IF.IFA OIL REFINERYOwnership, output and relation to E..R.?,The Haifa Oil Refinery belongs to ConsolidatedRefineries. Limited, a British company jointly owned by two british oil companies, the Shell Company and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company,   its replacement value is approximately 30 million.    Its annual capacity is h million tons and itsinput of crude oil normally comes from the following sources: -by pipeline from the Iraq Petroleum Company oilfield at Kirkuk, 2 million tons: . by pipelinefrom Kirkuk to Tripoli (Lebanon) and thence bytanker to Haifa, 1 million tons;   by tanker fromthe Persian Gulf I million tons.    Just over 70%of the output belongs to the ;,..I.0,C. &amp; Shell, thebalance being -refined for a fee on behalf of theAmerican companies, who are partners in the iraq petroleum Company.In 19h7 the refined products were distributed as follows350,000 tonsBritish Armed Forces (direct purchase from Haifa)150,000 tonsEtE.Pi, countries (excluding U.K.)850,000 tonsArab countries (excluding Palestine)1,300,000 tonsPalestine,600,000 tonsShips&apos;r.bunkgrs500,000 tons other icountries150,000 tons.These figures do not,  however, provide a very&apos;reliableguide to future distribution,  since the needs of some of the importing countries have altered in the interval.   Egypt,for instance, which took over 1,100,000 tons in 1947.,  hasrecently increased her own indigenous production and isUnited Kingdomand other British territories
unlikely to take more than 300,000 tons from Haifa in thefuture.   As a rough estimate,  however, Haifa may he expectedto provide between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 tons of refined products to E.R.P. countries other than the United kingdom or from 6% to % of all the refined oil products importedby those countries.    The British oil exported from Haifaamounts to approximately 1% of British world trade in oil,2.     Closing of the Haifa refineryThe Haifa refinery originally closed down on the12th April as a result of Jewish attacks on the Arab labour employed by the Company.    It has remained closed ever sincefor three reasons:-(a),   the Company considered conditions in Haifa soinsecure that the continued operation of the refinery would have jeopardised the safety oftheir employees;(b) the Government of Iraq have refused to allow the Iraq. Petroleum Company to pump oil fromthe pipeline from Kirkuk to Haifa;(c) the refinery itself has subsequently been occupied by Jev/ish troops.The Jews have lately re-opened a portion of the plant inorder to refine about 20,000 tons of crude oil left&quot; in the tanks when it closed down.    These stocks have now been exhaustedand the Jews will have difficulty in obtaining any more crude oil and will find it almost impossible to obtain regularsupplies without the co-operation of the British and/ar american oil companies.   At present, therefore, the refineryis at a standstill.3*     Previous attempts to secure the reopening of the refineryBoth the Jewish authorities and the British oil companies are anxious to reopen the refinery as soon aspossible.    Unfortunately, their anxiety is not shared by theGovernment of Iraq, who control the two pipelines (Kirkuk -Haifa and Kirkuk - Tripoli) through which three-quarters of the refinery1s crude oil is normally received.   The iraq petroleum Company (23^ of whose shares are held by each ofthe following:-   Shell. A.I.0.C, French Oil companies and american oil Companies) accordingly asked the Government ofIraq on what conditions they would permit the resumption of oil supplies through the Kirkuk-Halfa pipeline.    The IraqiPrime Minister replied that he would never allow Iraqi oil to go to Haifa as long as the Jews were in control there,and that, unless Haifa were internationalised, further negotiations were useless.    The oil companies have not yetapproached the Jewish authorities, but Jewish representatives have told U.S. officials that, although they would neverwillingly agree to relinquish any sovereignty over Haifaitself,  they might nevertheless accept some form of inter-national control over the operation of the refinery and thedistribution of its products.
h*     A possible caapromiseIt might be possible to persuade all the parties concerned to agree to the reopening of the refinery on thefollowing conditions;-(a) that the refinery should be operated by itsBritish owners under the supervision and protection of the Mediatorj(b) that the Arab states and the Jews shouldreceive a proportion of the refinery&apos;s outputequal to their normal requirements,  theremainder being exported to countries outsidethe Middle East;(c) that the Mediator should ensure that reserves of crude or refined oils in Haifa did notexceed an agreed maximum^The Jewish authorities are known to consider that,if Iraq&apos;s consent cannot be secured, the refinery should nevertheless be reopened and operated on crude oil importedby tanker and have threatened to operate the refinery them-selves,  if this is not done.    The A0I0O.C and the shell company are willing to comply but are opposed by the iraq petroleum Company who&apos; fear, with considerable reason,  thatsuch a step would be so resented by the Government of Iraqthat the latter would cut off the flow of oil through theKirkuk - Tripoli pipelinea    2,000,000 tons of crude oilare now being exported annually from Tripoli to Europeanrefineries.   Not only would this oil be lost, but therewould be a risk that the Iraq Petroleum Company might lose their concession^    It would,  therefore, be entirely contraryto our interests to allow the refinery to be opened withoutIraqi consentc
