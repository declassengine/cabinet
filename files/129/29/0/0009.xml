(38) 1994th August, 1948CABINETCOST OP INFORMATION services memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer think that my colleagues ought to be aware of the present cost of the various government Information Services, including the British Council and the B.B.C.Oversea Service.2. The total cost of the Government Information Services at home andabroad in the Estimates for the year 1948-49 is shown in summary form in thefollowing tables. The position is set out in greater detail in the appendedmemorandum produced by the Treasury for the Public Accounts Committee.Information        OperationalStaff Expenditure Total IIIHome Departments     ...... 435,100 2,044,600 2,479,700C.O.I.H.M.S.O.TotalAbroad DepartmentsB.B.C.     ...C.O.I.H.M.S.O.Total465,S0O 1,915,000 2,380,800215,6003,OS8,000 2,748,700 5,836,7002,100,000 2,400,000 4,500,000430,200 562,800 993,000292,0005,076,10011,621,700Total (ignoring the small adjustments shown in the Annex)   ...... 16,697,8003. After discussion on the Information Services Committee it has been&apos;agreed that, with a view to possible economies, an enquiry should be institutedinto the cost of the Home Information Services. The present intention is that this enquiry should be carried out by a small working party under the chairmanship of a retired civil servant with representatives of the Treasury and the lord president&apos;s Office, and a man from outside the Government service with publicityexperience.4. The question arises whether this enquiry should be extended to coverInformation Services abroad (including the British Council and, presumably, the oversea Service of the B.B.C.) as well as the Home Information Services. this raises issues on which the Ministers of the oversea Departments will no doubtwish to comment. It would, of course, be a much more formidable task, and thereis perhaps much to be said for concentrating on the Home Information Services,at any rate in the first instance.R. S.
