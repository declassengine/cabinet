V. A.MINISTRY OP DEFENCE, S.W.I.11TH SEPTEMBER,   1948.
SECRET&apos;DRAFT STATEMENT(To be made by the Lord President in thecourse of a speech on the Address in theHouse on Tuesday, September Ihth,  191+8).DEFENCE PREPARATIONSThe Foreign Secretary will be reviewing the foreignsituation next week, but the House will appreciate - that thestrength of. our Forces must he determined largely by thegeneral state of world affairs and the part they have to play in implementing, the policy of H.M. Government.    It was anticipated at the end of the war that by this time inter-national difficulties would have been well on the way tosolution.    As a result we decided that it was right to take some risk on Defence precautions in. order- that we could putour whole effort behind our- industrial recovery.    Unfortunately,-that expectation has not yet been realised and we have,therefore, had. to review the present state of our defence forces.    It is our constant desir-e to find a peaceful way of resolving the outstanding problems, but, however great arcour hopes, It would he folly not to reckon with theirdisappointment.    Our Armed Forces must be maintained in acondition of preparedness to fulfil the demands which may bemade upon them.Since the middle of 1945 we have been operating a planned and orderly demobilisation of our war-time forces,and, as the House Is aware, they.were to be reduced to716,000 by 31st March next.    This continued and rapid run- 1down of the Forces&apos; has created&quot;temporary difficulties for all three Services in the matter of trained personnel and, ifthe existing release programme were maintained,  the positionwould not improve over the next few months.    Accordingly,the Government have decided that all National Service men due
for release in the next few months, who have not left their units for release by today, must he retained for a periodof three months beyond the date on which, according to theexisting arrangements,  they would have been released.    Thereis no other method by which the Armed&quot;Forces could meet the commitments which they now have; in this way alone can theloss of trained men be halted.    Releases in Class &apos;B*  andon compassionate grounds will not be affected.    The position will bo kept under constant review in the light of thecurrent international situation.As a result of this action the strength of the Forcesat the end of this year will be about 30,000 greater thanit would have been had the planned programme continued,the increase being in trained personnel who, in presentcircumstancesP are the real need.    The Government very muchregret having to take this step which involves a revisionof the release arrangements set out in the White Paper onCall-Up to the Forces in 1947 and 1948 (Cmd. 683I  of May 1946)It was made plain in the White Paper that unforeseen .circumstances might lead to a revision of the estimates onwhich the arrangements were based with a consequent variation in the arrangements themselves.    It will,  for the reason that I have given, be impossible to adhere to the intentionthere expressed that men called up for service during 1947would not be required tc serve for- longer than two years,and that men already serving in the Forces at 31 st December,1946  (except those serving under voluntary engagements forfixed periods) would be released before the end of 1948.The retention of National Servicemen with the Coloursis not the only measure we are taking to strengthen our defence Forces,    It is essential that the Auxiliary Forces,which dre vital to our defences,  should be brought up to
strength as soon as possible.    In the case of the Army, theneed is to have in existence cadres of trained men ready toreceive the men-called up under the 1 9h7 National service act after they have completed their full-time service.    the key positions which the Air Defence Units and fighter squadrons hold in the defence of the country and theimportance of being able to defend our sea communicationsmake it no less important that we should bring the RoyalAuxiliary Air Force and the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve upto strength.    A special recruiting campaign for the auxiliary forces of all three Services is on the&apos;point of beingstarted to enable these necessary reinforcements of ourdefences to be achieved.Some three months ago we re-opened Section &apos;A&apos;  of theRegular Army Reserve;  this Reserve will have an important part to play in our general preparedness.As the House is aware, those who. saw service in therecent war are still liable to recall in the event ofemergency and plans to this end are ready.    In addition,schemes have been prepared for the voluntary registration of men and women with certain types of war experience anatraining who are not in a position to undertake training inpeace-time.    The Service Ministers will shortly be announcing the details of various schemes which,  should the need arise,will enable direct and rapid contact to be made with men andwomen with the necessary qualifications.The build-up of our auxiliary forces is of prime importance.    The Government counts on the firm support of all who have standing and influence, not least from the Membersof this House,  in. carrying these measures through to success,and I would ask especially for. a generous response from all who are in a position to give their services and for thefullest possible co-operation from employers.
.   Let me make it clear that the measures we are taking to build up the reserve and auxiliary forces in no waydetract from the urgent need to accelerate the recruitment ofour Regular Forces.Equipment is of no less importance.    Up to now the forces have been relying for their current needs largely on war-timestocks; these stocks are&apos;becoming depleted and some items are already obsolete.    We must,  therefore, accelerate theimprovement of the equipment position especially in the fields of air defence,  armour, and Infantry weapons.    The overhaulof stocks of war-time equipment has also been speeded-up and the Service and Supply Departments are increasing theirmanpower for this purpose.In regard to aircraft, we have to meet not only ourown production&quot;needs but also those of other countries,including the members of Western Union, who are &quot;using british types.    Extra work is required in some factories and we areadopting measures that will nearly double thepresent rate of output of certain fighters.    At the sametime &quot;older types of fighters in store will be re-conditioned.The House will expect me to say a word on Civil Defence.In these days preparedness in this field must be an integral part of our general defence arrangements..  considerable progress has already been made with plans for assisting thepopulation and for the re-organisation of the Civil defence services.    The Government expect to be able to introduceCivil Defence legislation at an early date.i Everyone must regret that the world situation is suchas to make necessary the precautions I have outlined.    Someof these are temporary, but meanwhile the Government are continuing their review of the long-term defence policy.Whilst the measures we are taking will have some effect upon- h -
our economy, they will, we.hope, not he such as to jeopardise in any way our recovery.    Our task has &quot;been tomaintain a fair balance between pur needs in the defencefield on the one hand and of the hroad national economyon the other.MINISTRY OP DEFENCE,  S.W.1.11TH SEPTEMBER,  19U-8.- 5 -
