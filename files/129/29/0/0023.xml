CABINETRECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURE OP THE british transport COMMISSION   &apos;Memorandum by the Minister1 of transport* When the Cabinet approved an increase in railway fares and charges last autumn (c.M.(h7) 67th Conclusions, Minute l),it was with the intention of reducing the loss which in 19h7would fall upon the Exchequer, and of putting the british transport Commission into&quot;a position (a) to meet the full costof their operation in 19h8, including any increase in cost dueto concession of any part of the wage claims which were thenunder investigation, and (b) to put aside out of revenue properprovisions for wastage of assets, amortization of capital andgeneral reserve.Original Target2. The level of railway fares and charges was fixed at55 per cent over pre-war levels with effect from 1st October19h7, and the new rates, together with certain increases in thecharges of the railway-owned docks, were estimated to yield anadditional  .65m. in gross receipts in 19h8, and thus enablethe railways to bridge the gap between estimated receipts andexpenditure and to earn the same figure as had been paid inRental ( 38m.) during the period of control, together withsome  5irn. intended to meet the lift needed, on account of increased price levels, in the accumulated reserves for arrears of maintenance.COPY NO.V3* The objective was, therefore, that any interest savingconsequent upon the employment of national credit for buyingout stockholders should be used to strengthen the undertaking and provide for contingencies, and not applied in wageconcessions or other current expenditure.   The calculationsmay be roughly summarised as follows :- m.Amount of Rental 38fin.Required for Capital Charges,  etc.Interest - 2^ per cent on  900m. 22-gAmortization of Capital 3*General Reserve 3Taxation on appropriations forAmortization and Reserve gjgIn addition, the Railways held &quot;non-railway interests whichmight be expected to yield about  2-Jm.    The possibility offurther increases in expenses and loss of passenger trafficfollowing increased fares was set off against the hope of a-    155(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential &quot;0.P.Ch8).2133QTH AUGUST. 19U8
rising volume of general merchandise traffic, and against anexpectation that certain concessions made to Service travelwould he discontinued.    The costs of making good arrears ofmaintenance and abnormal wear and tear on the railways duringthe war were to be charged against reserves set up for thispurpose during the period of control.Revised TargetU* The estimated charge for interest assumed thatTransport Stock would be issued at 2^ per cent,   y/hen thetime came,  the^rate had to be fixed at 3 per cent.   Thedifference of -g- per cent on  900m. meant an increased burdenof  l4..5m. per annum.    There were also increases in costsjnotably in National Insurance and Goal, but the most importantadverse factor was the extent to which traffics were fallingshort of the levels which had been expected.5. It thus became apparent in the spring that theCommission would not be in a position in 19^5-8 to make reservesfrom profits as plannedi   On the other hand,  it would have beenpremature to make pessimistic forecasts of actual lossjprovided the general public policy of stabilisation was successful and there was no further worsening of traffics.6. The position as it locked towards the middle of the yearmay be expressed in figures as follows:-*Estimated short-fall of traffic receipts(See Appendix A - column (3))Increased interest costPossible off-sets: -Profits on non-railway undertakingsSaving on privately-owned wagons and Government &quot;works general Reserve:    allocation droppedTaxation no longer likely to be incurred&quot;Lift&quot; on arrears of maintenance(para.2)This assumes that the ;ilift:; for past arrears of maintenance isnot an essential addition to the already large reserves, and.that the profits of other undertakings(largely investments inbus companies)  can properly be applied towards filling therailway gap.   A decrease in train miles which had been expected,combined with improved operation, had tended to offset certainrises in cost levels.    If the Commission were to feel justified by the statutory requirement to amortize their capital in adopting a less onerous basis of provision for replacement of physical assets year by year, part of the remaining gap wouldbe bridged.   But this and -other questions of financial policy they are not yet in a position to decide.Present Position7* The Commission have reviewed the re suits of working,the railways during the first six months of the year, and,unfortunately, present indications are that even the revised mi  m.25Li2^3fejr29i-22
estimate of traffic will not &quot;be is continuing to rise,8. The factors affectingreceipts are as follows:-attained and that expenditure the main heads of traffic&apos; (a)    Passenger TrafficNo allowance was made in the original estimate for loss of traffic due to the increases themselves;    It is the considered opinion of the Commission, based upon the widespreadobservation of the railway staff, that the present level offares has driven traffic away to the increasing competition of the road, which has been aggravated by the number of roadcoaches available to that side of the transport industry.There is, of course, behind this competition a serious problem as to the. competitive level of fares, which can only be solved,if at all,  as part of the general review of charges, upon whichthe Commission is actively engaged.The reduction in the carriage stock since the out-,break of war and the further reduction in the effective stockresulting from the increase in the number under repair has caused the coaching train mileage in the first 2k weeks- of19U8 to be 26 millions (21 per cent) less than in 1938 andthus reduced the competitive power of the railways to conveypassengers, particularly those&apos; travelling in organised parties,at times and under conditions likely to attract traffic.Increased train mileage would require additional coal.Something may be done to earn increased net revenueby the restoration of cheap excursions at times when the rolling stock is not urgently needed for other purposes, but no substantial development in this direction is possible until more coaching stock is available.It must be emphasised -that any further general increase in railway fares, could in present circumstances only-lead to further loss of traffic.   The Corn-mission^ problem isto find means of offering improved facilities at rates which will increase net revenue without impairing the generalfares structure,&apos;(b) CoalIn the beginning of the year receipts from coaltraffic were running little below/ the estimated level, butthe gap between actual and estimated receipts in recent weeks,if continued, would produce a. deficiency of  2-g-m. for theyear&apos;.Railway receipts from the conveyance of coal trafficamounted to  3hm* in 1938 and will probably amount to some 67m, in 19h-8, nearly twice the pre-war. figure, but thesefigures are not comparable because the 19h-8 figure containswagon hire which formerly accrued to private owners and becausethe length of haul&apos; is now greater.   The true increase in coal-freight charges remains at 55 per cent,(c) Iron and Steel and MineralsThese traffics have been good and the estimate isbeing realised.
(d)    General MerchandiseIt is here that the most serious deficiency betweenestimate and realisation has occurred.   There was an undoubtedloss of general merchandise traffic to road transport in theearly weeks &quot;of this year, when a substantial, volume of traffic was deliberately diverted from rail to road as an insurance against an apprehended shortage of railway wagons.    Though theinstructions were eventually withdrawn^ railway revenues sufferedand once traffic has been lost it is not easy to win it back.Throughout the year the movement of general merchandisehas been disappointing and the short-foil has become mo^e markedrecently.   While our original estimates assumed that non-Goverh-mental traffics in the second half of this year would be 3 oe^cent more than in i 9*4-6,  there has; in fact, been a substantialdecrease.    The figures for non-Governmental general merchandisetraffics illustrate the position:    in the sixteen weeks ended the 8th August these receipts,, adjusted to the same levels of charge, are estimated to be 7 per cent less than those inthe corresponding period of 19h7 and 10 per cent below thoseassumed.in the estimate of a year ago *There has also been a marked increase in the numberof &apos;0? licence vehicles,  i.e*, vehicles&apos;owned by a trader tocarry his own goods *    In May and June more than 8,000 additionalvehicles were licensed to operate, apart from those intended for retail deliveries or known to operate only within a radius of 25 miles.    This represents a substantial addition tocompetitive haulage.9. On the expenditure side, the Commission and its Execu-tives are anxious to secure the economies which unificationmakes possible and some savings may be effected quickly.Investigations are in hand to determine the numbers and types of rolling stock required by the railways,  and in due course a substantial reduction in the total requirements of wagons canbe achieved, with appreciable savings in cost.    The mergingof the L.M.S.  and L.N.E. in Scotland will produce certain administrative economies and there will be a reduction in thenumber of district offices in all departments in England andWales.   Economy will also result from the closing of littleused railway stations and of unremunerative branch lines, whilean examination is being made into .the numbers of staff 2107/employed in comparison with the. number employed before thewar.   But it cannot be expected that substantial economies, oftenonly to be secured by further expenditure, can yield much resultin the immediate future.   Some of the steps envisaged are ofa long-term character and changes in organization are impededby difficulties in the provision of houses for staff andoffice accommodation.10. The prices of the many commodities used by theRailways for maintenance and operation have continued to rise:the Board of T ......factures, forin June 19h8.iron and steel, of which the .Railways are large users, will make matters worse.    There will be some reductions in expenditurefollowing the fall in traffics but these necessarily accrue^slowly and would at best not exceed one-third of the reductionin traffic,  just as a rising volume of traffic can be ca-rriedwithout a proportionate rise in expenditure.
11. In particular, the Commission has boon faced with substantial increases in coal prices since the present levelof fares and charges was fixed.    The increases announced induly igh.8 will cost about  fm.. this year and  lim. in a full year, which, added to the increase of January, 191+8, amountingto  5m. in a full year, makes an unforeseen burden since theduly 19^4-7 estimates were prepared of  6-g-m. per aimuiiu   Theannual coal bill of the Railways (including steamboats) is nowat the rate of  36m. per annum compared with  11-g-m. in 1938, orthree times as much.    The quantities of coal consumed were 13.3 million tons in 1933 and at the rate of lh.,6 million tons in19h\8.   The coal now being received is of much inferior qualityto that used before the war and this involves a heavier con-sumption and results, in reduced operating efficiency.    the indirect effects of dearer coal are reflected in the cost ofelectricity, steel and other materials and cause further increases in railway expenditure012. It is net possible at this stage to give any accurateforecast of the&apos;financial out-turn of the Commission&apos;s operations at the end of the year.    The Commission have to reconstitutetheir capital accounts and determine their policy in regard to charges for renewal, and include the financial effect of thevarious acquisitions of the road transport undertakings, whichwill be increasingly important.   Even if no further concessionsare made to demands for increased wages, a substantial deficit on railway working taken by itself is inevitable and there willbe a deficit on the Commissions undertaking as a whole.C enciusions15. I have thought it well to circulate this paper to -warn my colleagues that we shall find ourselves in thedisappointing position of having an adverse balance in the accounts of the Transport Commission for the first year;    this raises acutely the question whether it will be possible toavoid increased charges, at least for the conveyance of theheavy bulk traffics such as coal and iron and steel, which theCommission have been anxious to avoid.   Railway charges ingeneral are only 55 per cent above pre-war, but the cost ofmaterials and wages has,  it is estimated, increased by rather more than 100 per cent.   A continued discrepancy of this order is not consistent with solvency of the Transport undertaking.14. I -would therefore like to emphasize to my colleagues the importance of not doiiig anything which will add to thedifficulties and costs of the public transport system,  and Iwould like to indicate some of tho points where I think we canbe helpful1-(l)    Where the Government itself controls prices, very strong justification should be required beforeadding to the burdens of the public transport system.    I have already referred to the effect of^:       the increases in coal prices, with its discriminaLoryeffect against the railways, and in iron and steel prices. -   .(2)    I think it should be accepted as a principle thatthe Government should pay for services rendered atthe rates which commercial usors on the sames cale would be asked to pay..
(3)    I em watching closely the growth of &apos;C&apos; Licences.(ii)   Our investment and other policies should recognise-the serious financial consequences of starving-railway services with consequent diversion of traffic to privately-owned road transport, both passenger and goods.   Last year the railways asked for,070 coaching stock but were cut to a figures of1,000,  subsequently increased to 1,200.     A similarconsideration arises in connection with the needfor additional buses for the London transport executive.(5)   Departments should ensure that the Commission1srail and road&apos; services get their fair share ofGovernment traffic both now and as the Commission&apos;sroad transport undertaking grows.     Further,   it is obviously most damaging to the Commission ifDepartments establish or increase their own fleetsof road vehicles for the purpose of hauling traffic which could be carried by the Commission.A.B.Ministry of Transport,Berkeley Square House, W.1 .30th August, i9k8.
