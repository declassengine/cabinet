this document is   the property of his  britannic   majestvs  governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1948.SECRET CopyCP. (48) 20S17th August, 1948No. 3 1CABINETEIRE AND THE BRITISH commonwealth memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations think my colleagues should see the various statements (set out in Annex Ato this paper) which have been made recently by Eire Ministers on the subject- of Eire&apos;s relationship with the Commonwealth, as it appears to them.   Whilstcontinuing to press for the abolition of Partition, Eire Government spokesmen (1) contend that Eire is no longer a Member of the Commonwealth;(2) state that Eire is, however, &quot; associated &quot; (in a manner which is leftundefined) with the Commonwealth;(3) appear to be contemplating the repeal of the Eire Executive Authority(External Relations) Act, 1936.2. I append (Annex B) a Note which I have received from Lord Rugby, theUnited Kingdom Representative in Eire, giving background information about these statements.3. While our relations.with Eire generally are now more friendly than theyhave been for a long time, these statements by the-new Eire Ministers underlineEire&apos;s detachment from the Commonwealth more plainly than Mr. de Valeraever ventured to while he was in office.4. The termination of the Eire External Relations Act would remove thelast formal link between Eire and the Commonwealth. It may well be thatEire Ministers do not fully appreciate what such a step would mean; and wemust, I think, consider in due course whether their attention should not bedrawn to the possible consequences of their proposal. But this question concernsnot only the United Kingdom and Eire : it concerns also the Commonwealthgenerally, and, if it were decided to make any approach to Eire, prior consultationwith other Commonwealth countries would, of course, be necessary.5. There is also the question whether, in view of Mr. CostelkVs statement that Eire is no longer a Member of the Commonwealth, it would be right for usto renew the invitation to him to attend the October meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers, which he has already received, but to which he has not yetreplied.6. These matters call for consideration, but I do not suggest that a decision should be taken now. I will circulate a further memorandum on the subject in afew weeks&apos; time.P. J.

- ANNEX a recent Statements by Eire Ministers regarding ErRE&apos;s relationship with the British CommonwealthI. Mr. S. MacBride, Minister of External Affairs, in Dail Eireann on 20thJuly, 1948 :-&apos;&apos; If we are to create a sound framework of our relations with Britain,it must be appreciated that what matters is the substance and not the formof the relationship. . . .&apos;&apos; The British Crown may well be a traditional rallying point for thepeople of Britain, Australia, New Zealand or Canada. If I were an English-man, or an Australian, I probably would feel considerable attachment tothe British Crown and would attach value to the traditional forms that gowith it. . . . But there is no parallel between the history of the Common-wealth countries and the history of our country. We are a small country with a very different history; a history which has been one of continualstruggle for survival as a nation. We take pride in our history, in ourculture, in our race and in our nation. We resent anything that takes away from that pride of nationhood or race.&quot; We want to be friendly with our big neighbour, not merely becauseshe is a big neighbour, but because we have many things in common. TheCrown and outward forms that belong to British constitutional history are merely reminders of an unhappy past that we want to bury, that have norealities for us and only serve as irritants.&quot;On 21st July, on the second day of the debate in Dail Eireann. Mr. MacBridereplied to a questioner by saying, &apos;&apos; The answer is that we are certainly not amember of the British Commonwealth of Nations.&quot; Later in the same debateMr. MacBride was asked, &quot; What is the British Labour Party point of view? &quot;and replied, &quot; That we are not members of the British Commonwealth.&quot; He wenton to say, &quot;It is unfortunate that we have had to discuss these matters in this house at the moment. Our constitutional position at the moment is certainly, insome respects, anomalous. We are clearly not part of the British Commonwealth.We are clearly a sovereign and independent State. We lack an external head forthe State, with external powers.&quot;II. Mr. J. A. Costello, Taoiseach (Prime Minister) of Eire, in Dail Eireannon 28th July, 1948 :-&quot; Captain Cowan asked the Taoiseach if he will state when and underwhat circumstances Ireland ceased to be a member of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations.The Taoiseach : Ireland&apos;s constitutional position is governed by theprovisions of the Constitution.In particular, Article 5 avers that Ireland is a sovereign, independent,democratic State, while Article 29 recognises that the State is, or may be,associated with the members of any group or league of nations for the purposeof international co-operation in matters of common concern.The constitutional position is that Ireland is a sovereign, independent,democratic State associated with the members of the British Commonwealth.The process by which Ireland ceased formally to be a member of that commonwealth has been one of gradual development.Captain Cowan : Am I to take it, then, that the Taoiseach states thatthis country has ceased to be a member of the British Commonwealth?The Taoiseach : It has ceased to be formally a member, but is associatedwith the other members in accordance with Articles 5 and 29, to which I have referred.&quot;III. Mr. J. A. Costello, in Dail Eireann on 5th August, 1948 : &quot; Ireland&apos;s association with the Commonwealth of Nations depends on the factual position. This factual relationship upon which our association is based depends on the reciprocal exchange of concrete benefits in suchmatters as trade, and citizenship rights; the principle of consultation andco-operation in matters of common concern, and on the many ties of bloodand friendship that exist between us and those other great nations whose
population includes so many of our own people. Our association with theCommonwealth is a free association which by virtue of its very freedom canbe terminated by unilateral action.The  question  whether   Ireland  is  a  Republic  is  purely  one  ofnomenclature which I am hot prepared to discuss. Ireland, by its constitution,^       is a sovereign, independent, democratic State in which all powers ofGovernment derive under God from the people.Captain Cowan: May I ask. the Taoiseach, for the purposes of this parliament, for the purposes of the people, whether we can have it clearly stated by him whether we are a Republic or not, bearing in mind that his predecessor has stated definitely that we are? I want to know where west and.Mr. Costello : We stand in this matter where Article 5 of the constitutionsays we stand : that is to say that Ireland is a sovereign, independent,democratic State&apos;. To what the constitution describes us I have nothing to add.Captain Cowan : May I put it this way that the Imperial Conferenceof 1926 stated that the British Empire was then an association of freecountries : free, sovereign and independent. Has our position changed since that, constitutionally ?Mr. Costello : Slightly, I think.&quot;IV. Mr. Norton, Tanaiste (Deputy Prime Minister) and Minister for social welfare, in Dail Eireann on 6th August: &quot; Does he (Mr. de Valera) know of any other country in the world whichuses a foreign monarch to accredit its representatives to other countries?Does the United States do it ? Does any other Republic in the world do it \It does not. This is one of the unique constitutional somersaults of Deputyde Valera in which he succeeded in finding a King in an independent,sovereign Republic to accredit representatives to foreign Powers.I think that it would do our national self-respect good at home andabroad, if we were to proceed without delay to abolish the External relations act.&quot;- ANNEX BEIRE AND THE COMMONWEALTHNote by Lord Rugby (United Kingdom Representative in Dublin)The trend of events in Irish politics, and particularly the indications that the external Relations Act is likely to be annulled in the near future, raise the wholequestion of Eire&apos;s position in, or relation to, the British Commonwealth.(So long as the. Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 was operative the Irish FreeState could be regarded as a normal member of the Commonwealth with a governor-General representing The King. The anti-Treaty party headed byMr. de Valera, though they failed to gain victory in a bitterly fought civil war,finally succeeded in working on Irish passions and prejudices so that the FiannaFail party came to power under Mr. de Valera&apos;s leadership, and in due course a new Constitution was proclaimed, the Governor-Generalship was abolished,a President was appointed and the only operative link with the British Common-wealth was contained in the External Relations Act passed in 1936. This Actauthorised the Eire Government to make use of The King as an agent for the automatic accrediting of Irish diplomats appointed to posts outside Eire. Thoughworded in the most restrictive terms, the Act could be regarded as keeping alive thesymbol of the Crown in the field of Eire&apos;s foreign relations. No doubt for that!v reason the United Kingdom Government, after consulting other members of theCommonwealth, decided that Eire&apos;s status in the Commonwealth should beregarded as not having been altered. The annulment of this Act would remove the basis of that ruling.)The recent statements in the Dail have shown a trend of agreement in all parties, the fact being that there is political capital to be made out of the external relations Act on Irish platforms, just as there is out of Partition.  The External
Relations Act was a skilful device. It has worked smoothly and was serving a useful purpose. But since extreme nationalists can quote it as implyingsubservience to the Crown of England and to the Union Jack, no man in public lifedare defend it. Moreover, no political party is. willing to hand over to anyother party the &quot;credit&quot; for removing this so-called offence to Eire sentiment.The recent statements by Eire Ministers show that a motion for the abolitionof the External Relations Act would go through without a division. What wouldbe left would be a mere verbal expression of &quot; association with the Commonwealth,&quot;whatever that may mean.R.Dublin, 9th August, 1948.
