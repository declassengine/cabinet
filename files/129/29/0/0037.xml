(48) 2271st October, 1948CABINETIRON AND STEEL bill memorandum by the Minister of SupplyFollowing the previous consideration at the meeting of the Cabinet on28th June (CM. (48) 44th Conclusions, Minute 3) I attach a revised draft of theIron and Steel Bill.2. In the following paragraphs I refer to certain outstanding points onwhich I wish the guidance of my colleagues. That raised in paragraphs 14 to 22is one which the Cabinet will wish to consider. The others will be consideredinitially by the Socialisation of Industries Committee, and the result of that committee&apos;s discussion will be communicated to the Cabinet.Relations between the Minister and the corporation . In earlier drafts I had followed the precedent clause that ministerial control would normally be exercisable only by general directions to the Corpora-tion given in the national interest. On reconsideration, however, I feel that toensure the effective planning of our national resources the Government should bein a position to determine specifically (a) the overall capacity of the industry;(6) the location of new plants; and(c) the types, qualities and sizes of the products.Accordingly, the proviso to Clause 3 and sub-section (2) of Clause 4 whichdepart from precedent-have been inserted.4. In justification of the departure from precedent which this involves, wemust bear in mind that the Corporation will be tempted by balance-sheet considera-tions to pursue a restrictive rather than an expansionist policy, it will not havea full appreciation of any plans of the Government whereby under bilateral negotiations, Colonial development schemes, defence considerations, &amp;c., therewill be changes in the direction and nature of demand; on location no Govern-ment could afford to allow uncontrolled industrial development. On all those matters which directly affect the economy of the country, the Government cannotand should not avoid ultimate responsibility to Parliament. In the normal courseof events the responsibility for decisions would lie with the Corporation, andit would only be when the Corporation^ proposals were in conflict with theGovernments broad national plans that the Government might want to issue a specific directive.5. It seems to me that it would be the negation of all we mean by planning the resources of the country through public ownership of our basic industries ifthese were to become independent empires, whose boards, although acting accordingto their lights in the best public interests, were not subject to central directionon those fundamental matters on which the economic and social well-being ofthe country depends, The iron and steel industry differs to some extent from theother socialised industries in that the details of its activities, e.g., the type ofproduct it should make, affect directly and seriously the pattern of our economy.If this view is accepted it is desirable to state the Governments powers clearly35950
in the Bill, as it may be open to doubt whether they are legally effective under the&quot;General Direction&apos;*&apos; which the Minister is entitled to give; and it is plainlydesirable to avoid&apos; the possibility of dispute on the question of powers.6. Against the considerations mentioned in the last paragraph are thefollowing:- ..! ;    (a) Control of overall capacity and of location can be secured, at any rate:negatively if not positively, by approval of the Corporation&apos;s general.\&amp;xirioSi-:i   ! programme of works of development (Clause 4 (3)); I hold, however,that negative control in these all-important matters is clumsy and&apos;&apos;    4-       ineffective.  &apos; .:&apos;:: -(6) Control over qualities, types and sizes of output can be secured by specificdirections flowing from a report of the Consumers&apos; consultative committee (Clause 0). But I hold that it would be unfortunate ifwe had to wait till a report covering these points filtered up to theMinister from such Committees.(c) A more serious objection is that the spirit of Clause 4 (2), in whichspecific powers of direction are set out, may be said to be inconsistent with the conception that full responsibility rests with the Corpora-tion; that it introduces the possibility of political influence of an undesirable sort on the administration of the Corporation; and thatit may create friction between the Minister and the Corporation, ora blurring of responsibility which would not conduce to efficiency.7. I recognise the strength of these arguments, but I am convinced thatthe balance lies in favour of extending Ministerial control on the lines of clause 4 (2), and I seek the authority of my colleagues accordingly.Retrospective Dates affecting Contracts, &amp;c.8. &apos; Previous nationalisation measures have contained provisions enablingimprudent and unreasonable contracts to be disclaimed if made after19th November, 1945 the date of the Lord Presidents announcement indicating the scope of the Government&apos;s nationalisation proposals. Apart from the factthat that statement in relation to steel was not specific, it would, I think, beUnsound to put at possible peril contracts and agreements dating so far backwhen transfer will not be made till 1950 or 1951. The Prime Ministers statementof the Government&apos;s intention to nationalise the industry during the lifetime ofthe present Parliament was made on 21st October, 1947, and that would be an appropriate date if retrospective powers are to be taken as I think they mustin this matter and I have therefore inserted this date in Clause 13.9. I considered carefully whether a similar retrospective date should beinserted in Clause 22, which enables the Corporation to recover assets transferredby a company which passes into public ownership. The purpose of this clauseis to stop disintegration of the steel companies, which by hiving off theirextraneous engineering or other activities could prevent those extraneousactivities passing into public ownership. The present degree of integrationwas no doubt motivated by sound technical or economic reasons, and&apos; theCorporation could be prejudiced if they were deprived of the end- and by-product activities which now surround the iron and steel industry. There hasbeen some hiving off of this character since the end of the war, but in my viewinsufficient and not serious enough to justify retrospective powers to reintegratethe companies with all the complexities and doubts which such powers wouldinvolve. Accordingly I seek the support of my colleagues to limiting the scopeof Clause 22 to action taken after the date of introduction.Loopholes , .    ,10. The effect of our compensation proposals is that the companies shallbe valued at a pre-Bill date but that they shall not pass into public ownershipuntil at least eighteen months later. All the obvious gaps for dissipation of assets, imprudent,contracts,,&amp;c, in the interval have, I am satisfied, been closed(see. paragraphs 8 and 9). But I recognise that some loopholes remain. Forexample, an,acquired company may have a partly-owned subsidiary whose assetscould be,dissipated, or a parent holding company might make an unsecured loantp a subsidiary iron and steel company in excess of the value of the latter&apos;s assets,and while the Corporation would acquire the shares of the latter for a. nominalprice the parent could receive cash rather than stock in compensation for a
possibly overvalued undertaking. There are certain bo be other potential loop-holes, but I am satisfied, after careful examination, that any attempt at thisstage to stop them would involve putting doubt on the validity of current contractsover an unknown but much wider area of the industrial and commercial field thanthe industry we aim to acquire. -&quot;&quot;        -,s A  :11. In the circumstances, therefore, I propose &quot;to make no legislativeprovisions in the Bill as introduced to cover these somewhat remote andimponderable contingencies, but I seek the authority of my colleagues to announceon Second ReadifigVthat if direct evidence is forthcoming; of action or intentionto defeat the purposes of the Bill and to reduce the value of the undertakings to be acquired, the Government will not hesitate either by amendment of this bill or by future legislation, if necessary of a retro-active character, to protectand indemnify the Corporation.Consultation with Other Boards12. Clause 44 has been inserted at the request of the Minister of fuel and Power to ensure tripartite consultation between the Corporation, theNational Coal Board and the Area Gas Boards and forms the counterpart to section 1 (6) of the Gas Act, which requires the Area Gas Boards to consult the National Coal Board and the iron and steel industry on their development plans.13. I fully agree that consultation should take place between socialised industries, not only on the problem of coke ovens, but on many other aspectswhere their interests may overlap, and I have no doubt that in practice full consultation would take place whether or not a formal statutory requirementis embodied. It does, however, seem to me open to serious question whether itis appropriate to extend the precedent of statutory consultation already embodied in the Gas Act as, if we do so, we are likely to find nationalisation measures, oramending Acts littered with clauses enjoining specific consultation on all manner of questions. This is a matter on which I suggest we trust, to the common sense of the Boards.Timetable14. It is assumed by our opponents and by the British Iron and steel federation that in the time between the Royal Assent early in 1950 and theGeneral Election it will not be physically possible to transfer the securitiesfrom the present owners to the Corporation. Indeed, there is no doubt thatgreat store is laid on the weakness of the Government&apos;s position in this respect.15. I have, therefore, considered whether it is possible, by a departure from precedent but without doing violence to any constitutional principle, to frame the Bill so that the Government could, if it so desired, set up theCorporation and effect the transfer of securities within two to three monthsof the Royal Assent. It is, in fact, highly doubtful whether we would want todo so, as there would be immense difficulty in getting some of the people wewould want to serve on the Corporation so long as they believed that the whole scheme might be nullified by a Conservative victory at the coming election. But,nevertheless, I feel that we would be in a strong position and possess what might well prove to be a powerful bargaining weapon if the terms of the Billdid in fact enable us to proceed quickly with the transfer. The present draftgives us this authority.16. The instruments necessary to implement the Bill have hitherto beenembodied in the following three sets of orders or regulations :-(a) An order to appoint a day for the transfer.(b) Regulations determining the manner in which the stockholders of eachcompany are to appoint a representative who would settle and agree::.f.compensation.      , -   &apos;(c) Stock regulations determining how the new stock of the nationalisedv. - undertaking is to be held and dealt with.&apos;      r^u iii ait- 17. If we follow precedent, the regulations under (6) would be made withina few days of the. Royal Assent, and require a stockholders&apos; representative tobe properly appointed within two or three months from that date, and allowhim a reasonable interval after appointment before the transfer takes placb. Theregulations under (c) would be made shortly before the transfer takes place.Both sets of regulations are now in common form, and if the stockholders are to
receive their compensation without difficulty or delay it is imperative that bqth setsshall be made and be effective before the date of transfer. The regulations under(a), (&amp;) and (c) above would be geared together;18. Again following precedent, each of these orders or regulations would bea statutory instrument subject to annulment by either House of Parliament.Thus&quot; the position could arise that if the Iron and Steel Bill is enacted by agree-ment towards the end of 1949, or under the current Parliament Bill early in1950, the subordinate legislation for making it operative could be rejected or held up by the House of Lords.19. On the assumption, which I am convinced is correct, that the broadstrategy of the Opposition will be to ensure that there is no effective transferof securities before the general election, then, if the date of that transfer is madedependent on regulations, the Lords would be tempted to hold them up on some minor or technical point.20. I have therefore departed materially from existing precedents. Ipropose that under Clause 11 (1) (read with Clause 47) the order appointing theday of transfer shall be a Ministerial act not subject to any parliamentary approval and I have included the substance of the stockholders&apos; representativeregulations and the stock regulations in the Bill itself in the lengthy 5th and 7th Schedules.21. My colleagues will wish to consider the political implications of thiscourse. On the one hand it means that we could in theory effectively nationalisethe industry before the general election. On the other hand it might be regardedas sharp practice to have clear power to transfer property on a gigantic scalea few weeks before a general election when a sizeable portion of the electoratewould claim that implementation of the Act should await the decision of theelection. The choice is clear. Either we take power to nationalise before theelection (i.e., the Bill as now drafted) or we admit forthwith that there is no prospect of nationalisation before the election (i.e., give the Lords power ofannulment of the order appointing the date of transfer).22. My own inclination is to leave the Bill as now drafted and keep in ourown hands the determination of the date of transfer, whether before or after theelection.Conclusion23. Subject to the decisions of my colleagues on the points outlined above,I propose to submit the draft Bill, with such further minor, drafting or con-sequential amendments as may be necessary, to the Legislation Committee.G.
