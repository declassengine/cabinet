(48) 204Vlth August, 1948CABINETCEYLONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations my colleagues should know that difficulties have arisen about Ceylon&apos;application for Membership of the United Nations.2. The application, made on 25th May, was considered by the MembershipCommittee of the Security Council on 29th June.3. The Committee adopted a recommendation in favour of admitting Ceylonby nine affirmative votes. The Soviet Union and the Ukraine abstained, reservingcomment for the Security Council.4. Despite this recommendation, the matter was raised a second time inthe Membership Committee on 1st July by the Soviet representative.5. On 1st July, the Ukrainian member became Chairman of the security council and of the Membership Committee; he has been followed in August bythe Soviet member. This enabled the Ukrainians to reopen the matter, and toallow the Soviet Union to propose that the Committee should ask the Governmentof Ceylon to show that Ceylon was really independent and democratic. Thiswas ruled out of order by seven votes to two, the United Kingdom and Canadaabstaining. After this vote, the Soviet representative on the Committee isreported to have said that his Government &apos;&apos; knew that Ceylon was not reallyindependent.&quot; .    .6. The recommendation of the Membership Committee will be consideredby the Security Council some time before 20th August. It is clear that the soviet union and Ukrainians may then make trouble.7. In his report, circulated to the Cabinet after his visit to Ceylon inFebruary this year (CP. (48) 91), the Under-Secretary of State for commonwealth relations said that Ceylon Ministers were already then alarmed about the attitudeof the Soviet Union, and the risk that she might use the veto. It was thiswhich led us to discuss the revision of the Defence Agreement between theUnited Kingdom and Ceylon concluded last year (Cmd. 7257). That Agreementgave the United Kingdom wide defence facilities in Ceylon, and we felt thatthe Soviet Union might argue that Ceylon was far from independent, since theUnited Kingdom had in effect the power to occupy the entire Island.8.   We therefore discussed a new &quot; Defence Declaration &quot; with Sir OliverGoonetilleke, when he was here in April.   This &quot; Declaration &quot; stated explicitlythat it had been freely negotiated between the two countries, and named, the places at which, and the purposes for which, defence facilities were granted to35777
us by Ceylon. We hoped that this new Declaration could be agreed and publishedbefore Ceylon applied for Membership of the United Nations.9. Unfortunately, however, the Ceylon Government made their applicationto the Secretary-General without consulting us, and when we asked them whatthey meant to do about the Defence Declaration, they said that they would prefer, for the present, to leave it alone.   Their reasons were that (a) their study of the draft could not be completed within the short periodnow available;(&amp;) it would give rise to discussion in the Ceylon Parliament which wouldbe more prejudicial than advantageous to their application for membership of the United Nations.10. The Ceylon Government attach the greatest importance to theiradmission to the United Nations. If they are not admitted, the Opposition will undoubtedly be strengthened. The Opposition consists principally of three separate Communist parties; these parties would argue that the failure of ceylon &apos;s application was the direct result of her Membership of the BritishCommonwealth; and that Burma, who left the Commonwealth, was immediatelyadmitted. Our High Commissioner in Ceylon said on 8th July: &quot; If Ceylon&apos;application is rejected, there may well be an increasing campaign, which thePrime Minister may find it difficult, if not impossible, to resist, that Ceylonshould leave the British Commonwealth.&quot;11. I have been discussing with the Ceylonese over the last two months what action could be taken to discourage the Soviet Union from using the veto.Among other things which have resulted from these talks, Mr. Corea has gone to Lake Success to canvass; and India and other Asiatic Governments have made representations to the Soviet Union. It is perhaps due to this action that the delegate of the Soviet Union amended in the final minutes what he had said in the Security Council. His original remark was that quoted above: &quot;HisGovernment know that Ceylon was not really independent.&quot; He amended this to read : &quot; His Government were aware that Ceylon had not been an independent state..&quot; This may mean that the Soviet Union are now hesitating about using the veto. We cannot be sure of this, but I am afraid that there is little more that we can do.12. But, if the Soviet Union do, after all, use the veto, and so preventCeylon&apos;s admission, we might be able to mitigate the effect of the blow byorganising a widespread protest by other Members of the United Nations againstthe action of the Soviet Union. This would make it plain that the great majority)of the Members of the United Nations did not regard the Defence agreement as affecting Ceylon&apos;s independent status, and that they considered that theSoviet Union&apos;s action was unjustified and wrong. This might effectivelycounteract any tendency of the Ceylon Government or of Ceylon public opinion to draw from their non-admission the conclusion that they should leave theCommonwealth.13. In view of the many uncertainties of the situation, however, and ofthe grave issues involved, I have thought it right to report the facts to mycolleagues.P. J. N.-B.Commonwealth Relations Office, S. W. 1,17th August, 1948.
