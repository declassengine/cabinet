ANNEXText of Conclusions of Part I of Count Bernadotte&apos;sreport to the United Nations1. Since I presented my written Suggestions to the arab and Jewish authorities on 27th June,  I have made no formalsubmission to either party of further suggestions or proposalsfor a definitive settlement.      Since that dote, however,  I ho.veheld many oral discussions in the Arab capitals and Tel Aviv,in the course of which various ideas on settlement have beenfreely exchanged.      As regards my original Suggestions, I holdto the opinion that they offered a general framework withinwhich a reasonable and workable settlement might have beenreached, had the two parties concerned been willing to discuss them.      They were flatly rejected,  however, by Tooth parties./Since they were put forth on the explicit condition that theywere purely tentative, were designed primarily to elicit views and counter-suggestions from each party, and, in any event,could he implemented only if agreed upon by both parties, Ihave never since pressed them.      With respect to one basicconcept in my Suggestions, it has become increasingly clear tome that, however desirable a political and economic union mightbe in Palestine, the time is certainly not now propitious forthe effectuation of any such scheme.2.. I do not consider it- to be within my province torecommend to the Members of the United Nations a proposed courseof action on the Palestine question.      That is a responsibilityof the Members acting through the appropriate organs.      In myrole as United Nations Mediator,  however, it was inevitable that I should accumulate information and draw conclusions from my experience which might well be of assistance to Members ofthe United Nations in charting the future course of united nations action on Palestine.      I consider it my duty, therefore,to acquaint the Members of the United Nations, through the medium of this report, with certain of the conclusions on meansof peaceful adjustment which have evolved from my frequent .consultations with Arab and Jewish authorities over the past three and one-half months and from my personal appraisal ofthe present Palestinian scene.      I do not suggest that these conclusions would provide the basis for a proposal which would readily win the willing approval of both parties..     I have not,in the course of my intensive efforts to achieve agreementbetween Arabs and Jews, been able to devise any such formula^I am convinced, however,  that it is possible at this stage to formulate a proposal which, if firmly approved and stronglybacked by the General Assembly, would not be.forcibly resisted by either side,  confident as I am,-, of course, that the security council stands firm in its resolution of 15th July that military action shall not be employed by either party in the Palestinedispute..     It cannot be ignored that the vast differencebetween now and last November is that a war has been started andstopped and that in the intervening months decisive events have(0        occurred. ,&apos;Seven basic premises3. The following seven basic premises form the basis for my&apos; conclusions:-
Keturn to pesce-    241(3)   peace must return to Palestine and every feasiblemeasure should be. taken to ensure that hostilities will .not be resumed and that harmonious relations betweenArab and Jew will ultimately be restored.The Jewish State(b) A Jewish State called Israel exists in Palestine andthere are no sound reasons for assuming that it will not continue to do so.Boundary determination(c) The boundaries of this new State must finally befixed either by formal agreement between the parties concerned or failing that, by the United Nations,Continuous frontiers(d) Adherence to the principle of geographical homogeneityand integration, which should be the major objective of the boundary arrangements,  should apply equally to Arab and jewish territories, whose frontiers should not therefore berigidly controlled by the territorial arrangementsenvisaged in the resolution of 29th November.Right of repatriation(e) The right of innocent people, uprooted from their homes by the present terror and. ravages of -war, to returnto their&apos; homes, should be affirmed and made effective,with assurance of adequate compensation for the propertyof those who may choose not to return.Jerusalem(f) The City of Jerusalem-, because of its. religious and inter--national significance and the complexity of interestinvolved, should be accorded special and separate treatment.International responsibility(g) International responsibility should be expressed wheredesirable and necessary in the form of internationalguarantees, as a means of allaying existing fears, andparticularly with regard to boundaries and human rights.Specific conclusionsh. The following conclusions, broadly outlined, would,in my view, considering all the circumstances, provide areasonable, equitable and workable basis for settlement:(a)    Since the Security Council,  under pain of Chapter VII   ,sanctions, has forbidden further employment ofmilitary action in Palestine as a means of settling the dispute,  hostilities should be pronouncedformally ended either by mutual agreement of theparties or, failing that, by the United Nations.The existing indefinite truce should be superseded a formal peace, or at the minimum,  an armisticewhich would involve either complete withdrawal anddemobilisation of armed forces or their wideseparation by creation of broad demilitarized zonesunder United Nations supervision.
(b) The frontiers between the Arab and Jewish territories,in the absence of agreement between Arabs and Jews,should be established by the United Nations anddelimited &quot;bv a technical boundaries commission appointed by and responsible to the United Notions,with the following revisions in the boundaries broadly mdefined in the resolution of the General Assembly of29th November in order to make them more equitable,workable and consistent with existing realities inPalestine.(l)    The area known as the Negev, south of a linerunning from the sea.near Mo3da1 east south-east -to Paleja (both of which places wouldbe in Arab territory), should be defined asArab territory;(II)    The frontier should run from Paluja north north-east to Ratal eh and Lydda (both of which placeswould, &quot;be in Arab territory), the frontier atLydda then following the line established inthe General Assembly resolution of 29thNovember;(ill)    Galilee should be defined as Jewish territory.(c) The disposition of the territory of Palestine not included within the boundaries of the Jewish state should be left to the Governments of the Arab states in full consultation with the Arab inhabitants ofPalestine, with the recommendation,  however,  that inview of the historical connection and common interestsof Transjordan and Palestine, there would be compellingreasons for merging the Arab territory of Palestinewith the territory of Transiordon, subject to such&apos;frontier rectifications regarding other Arab states as may be found practicable and desirable.(d) The United nations, by declaration or other appropriate means,  should undertake to provide special assurance that the boundaries between the Arab and Jewishterritories shall be respected and maintained,  subject only to such modifications as may be mutually agreedupon by the parties concerned.(e) The port of Haifa, including the oil refineries andterminals,  end without prejudice to their inclusion in the sovereign territory of the Jewish State or theadministration of the city of Haifa,  should be declareda free port, with assurances of free access forinterested Arab countries, and an undertaking on their part to place no obstacle in the way of oil deliveriesby pipeline to the Haifa refineries,  whose -distribution would continue on the basis of the historical&apos; pattern.(f) The airport of Lydda should be declared a free airportwith assurance of access to it and employment of itsfacilities for Jerusalem and interested Arab countries,(g) The City of Jerusalem,-which should be understood ascovering the area defined in the resolution of theGeneral Assembly of 29th November,  should be treatedseparately and. should be placed under effective united nations control with-eh extra urn feasible local autonomy forits Arab and Jewish communities, with full safeguards for the protection of the Holy Places and sites and freeaccess to them, and. for religious freedom.
*    243The right of unimpeded access to Jerusalem, by road,rail or air,  should he fully respected &quot;by all parties.The right of the Arab refugees to return to their homes in Jewish-controlled.territory at the earliestpossible date should, be affirmed &quot;by the United Notions,and. their repatriation, resettlement and economic and social rehabilitation,  and payment of adequatecompensation for the property of those choosing notto return,  should be supervised and assisted by theUnited Nations conciliation commission described inparagraph (k) below..The political,  economic,  social and religious rightsof all Arabs in the Jewish territory of P-lestine andof all Jews in the Arab territory of Palestine shouldbe fully guaranteed and respected by the authorities.The conciliation commission provided for in thefollowing paragraph should super-vise the observance of this  guarantee.      It should also lend its good offices,  on the Invitation of the parties,  to anyefforts toward exchanges of populations with a viewto eliminating troublesome minority problems,  and onthe basis of adequate compensation for propertyowned.In view of the special nature of the Palestine problem and the dangerous complexities of Arab-Jewishrelationships,  the United Nations should establish a&apos; Palestine conciliation commission.      This commission,which should be appointed for a limited period,  shouldbe responsible to the united Nations and act under its authority.      The commission, assisted by such united nations personnel as may prove necessary,  should undertake:-(i)    To employ its good offices to moke such recommendations to the parties or to theUnited Nations, and to take such othersteps as may be appropriate, with a view to ensuring the continuation of the peacefuladjustment of the situation in Palestine;(ii)    Such measures as it might consider appropriate in fostering the cultivation of friendly relations between Arabs and Jews;(iii)    To supervise the &quot;observance of such boundary,road,  railroad, free port, free airport,minority rights and other arrangements as maybe decided upon by the united Nations;(iv)    To report promptly to the United Nations any development in Palestine likely to alter thearrangements approved &quot;by the United nations in the Palestine settlement or to threaten the peace of the area.
