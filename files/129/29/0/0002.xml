this  document is  the property op  his  britannic  majesty&apos;s  governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1948SECRET Copy No. 31CP. (48) 19222nd July, 1948CABINETWAR PENSION RATESMemorandum by the Minister of PensionsMY colleagues will be aware that it was the intention of my predecessor tosubmit proposals for increases in certain war pension rates. His plan, which wasoutlined in the last paragraph of CP. (48) 163 (Comparison of War Pensionswith the Compensation to be paid to Miners under proposed Scheme of Supple-men tary Injuries Benefits) submitted by him to the Cabinet on 25th June, wasto improve the position of the unemployable pensioner and the pensioner under-going treatment for his pensioned disability, and, if the Supplementary Schemefor Miners was approved, to increase by 5s. the standard disablement rate andthe rate for the &quot; over 40 &quot; widow, widow with a child or children and invalidwidow, and by 2s. Qd. the pension of the unmarried dependant who has livedas the wife of the deceased man and has the care of his child.2. The Supplementary Scheme for Miners has now been made public and,as my predecessor anticipated, the result has been to increase the pressure fora revision of war pension rates. Sir Ian Fraser, in the Adjournment debate on War Disablement Pensions on 9th July, said that it was his intention andthat of the ex-service organisations for whom he was speaking to initiate a campaign in both Houses, in the press and in the constituencies to call attentionto a case which he believed stood on its own merits but which was stronglyfortified by the action taken by the National Union of Mineworkers. The BritishLimbless Ex-Service Men&apos;s Association has also been active, and much publicityhas been given to the report on a deputation which I recently received from them.3. The Unemployable War Pensioner. I am satisfied that, quite apartfrom the Miners&apos; Scheme, the position of the unemployable war pensioner calls for improvement. Indeed this is a point on which all the ex-service organisationsare in agreement and on which my predecessors have also felt very strongly. Thisis the most pitiful type of case and one which evokes the greatest sympathy.The men concerned are the hopelessly disabled relics of both World Wars whohave no prospects of employment or of ever again enjoying a normal life. Thepresent number of approved cases is comparatively small, being only 8,600. Ofthese only 5,800 are actually receiving the unemployability supplement, theremainder some 2,800 having transferred to sickness benefit which is more totheir advantage. If the supplement is raised above 26s. (which I hope it willbe), the 2,800 will naturally forgo sickness benefit and revert to unemployabilitysupplement with a consequent saving to the Insurance Fund.4. The War Pensioner undergoing Medical Treatment, for his WarDisability. When a pensioner undergoes medical treatment his pension is with-drawn and he receives treatment allowances equivalent to 100 per cent, pensionwhatever the degree of his disablement. In addition he may be eligible for sickness benefit. There are, however, some men mainly those of the 1914-18 war whoare not eligible for such benefit or only for benefit at a modified rate. In myopinion some assistance should be given to these men particularly since theirfailure to qualify for full sickness benefit will largely be due to their wardisablement.5.   Basic Rate of Disablement Pension. In 1919 the 100 per cent, rate forthe private soldier Was fixed at 40s. based on a cost of living figure of 215.   At35653 &quot; B
the outbreak of the 1939 war pensioners of the 1914 war still received the 40s.rate although the cost of living figure had dropped to 155, for which the appro-priate rate would be slightly under 30s. The rate provided in September 1939,for pensioners of the New War was 32s. Gd. and this was raised in three stagesuntil in August 1943, following considerable agitation for men of the two warsto be given equal treatment, it was raised to 40s.6. In 1945 there was strong pressure for the appointment of a SelectCommittee to review war pensions and in the election campaign many Labourcandidates supported the proposal. Following a Parliamentary Question on thesubject to the Prime Minister on 22nd August, 1945, it was decided at a meetingof the Social Services Committee on 1st October, 1945, that unless there wereimprovements in war pension rates it would be impossible to resist the demandfor a Select Committee. One of the proposals put by the Minister of pensions to the Social Services Committee was to raise the rate of disablement pensionby 10s. to 50s. a week. The decision, however, was to raise it to 45s. the rateadopted for the Industrial Injury pensioner. At the same time a Special HardshipAllowance was introduced for the partially disabled pensioner who was prevented by his disability from following his old occupation or one of equivalent standard.The Minister of Pensions expressed the view that despite the Special HardshipAllowance provision the basic rate should be 50s., but the Minister of national insurance dissented on the ground that, in view of the difficulties in defendingin Standing Committee the 45s. rate for the Industrial Injury pensioner, he wouldbe placed in an untenable position if the war pension rate were fixed at 50s.7. At the time these discussions were taking place the British Legion were pressing for a basic rate of 60s., but in October 1946 they put forward a claim for 90s. -a claim which still stands and to which they are committed by aresolution at this year&apos;s Conference. There is some evidence, however, that themore responsible leaders of the Legion realise that 90s. is an unrealistic figure.For example, Sir Ian Fraser in his presidential address at the Whitsun Conferencecalled for a moderate and practical programme and said he was convinced thatat the present time an increase in the basic rate could not be very great. It is significant also that in his speech at the Adjournment Debate he did not mentionany rate. The rate claimed by the British Limbless Ex-Service Men&apos;s association is 61s. 3d., undifferentiated for all non-Commissioned ranks, this being the present rate for the Army Warrant Officer, Class I.8. The case for an increase in the basic rate is based partly on the ground of a rise in the cost of living, partly on the ground of the rise in wages. In myopinion neither claim is by itself very strong though there is something to besaid for each of them. It is very difficult to make good comparisons of cost ofliving over a long period during which standards of consumption have changed;but in so far as one can do so the result is to suggest that the equivalent of the40s. rate paid in 1919 would be 41s. to-day. It will be strongly argued, however,that the real comparison is with the position in 1939. On that basis the 32s. Gd.of the 1939 war pensioner becomes 45s. Gd. (an increase of only Gd. a week), butthe 40s. of the 1914 war pensioner becomes 56s. As for wages, the overwhelming majority of war pensioners are in employment and receiving wages. Those whosedisabilities have forced them to take inferior employment are to a considerable extent compensated for their lessened earning capacity by the grant of SpecialHardship Allowance. There is, however, no special compensation for the man who continues at his old job but is prevented by his disability from earningthe same wages as before. But the most powerful argument for an increasein the basic rate is that based upon the new contributory scheme for miners.It is argued that as the State owes a special debt to the war pensioner, and as these already injured men have no good prospect of benefiting from supplementarycontributory schemes, the State should help them to enjoy a standard equal towhat the miners or other workers may obtain by means of contributory schemes.9. Basic Rate of Pension of Widow over 40, Invalid Widow and Widowwith a Child or Children.- In 1939 the private&apos;s widow of the 1914 war receiveda pension of 26s. 8d. a week with allowances of 10s. a week for her first child,7s. Gd. for the second and 6s. for each other child. For widows of the 1939 warthe comparable pension rate was 22s. Gd. with an allowance of 5s. for each child.To-day the pension of both widows is 35s. a week with an allowance of 11s. foreach child. In addition a rent allowance with a maximum of 15s. a week is payable to the widow with children where her rent and rates exceed 8s. a week.
3110. Despite these improvements the present rates cannot in my opinion beregarded as adequate and I feel that some moderate increase should be given.The Ex-Service Men&apos;s Associations, before the publication of the Miners&apos; Scheme,were asking for a minimum of 50s. for the widow, and their claim is strengthened by the fact that the miner&apos;s widow is to get that rate.11. Childless able-bodied Widow under 40. I agree with my predecessorthat there is no case for an increase in the rate of pension for this class of widow,which is at present 20s. where the man was a private. The fact that the supple-ment to be given to the similar miner&apos;s widow is now 5s. instead of the 20s.originally proposed will make it easier for the Government to defend the with-holding of any increase to the war widow.12. Unmarried Dependant who lived as the Wife of the Deceased Man andhas the care of Ms Child or Children. As the similar unmarried dependant of aminer is to get 47s. Qd. a week for herself and a child my predecessor intended to propose an increase in the pension of the service man&apos;s unmarried dependant of. 6^., making her personal pension 30s. a week, which with a child&apos;s allowance of 11s. a week would give her 41s. But as an increase of 2s. Qd. a week might beregarded as derisory, and as the war unmarried dependant can get a rent allowanceif her rent and rates exceed 8s. a week, and as moreover she gets 11s. a week for each child as against the industrial unmarried dependants allowance of 7s. Qd.for one child only, I do not propose to recommend any increase in the pension.13. Proposals. My proposals -the results of which are shown in the appendices are as follows : (1) 100 per cent. Disablement RateThat the rates for all non-Commissioned ranks be raised by 5s. aweek.   (See Appendix I.)An increase of only 5s. a week may in some quarters be regarded as derisoryparticularly as in about 70 per cent, of the cases the actual increase will be 2s. aweek or less, and in about 40 per cent, will be only Is. An increase of 10s. a week would, however, cost  7 million a year and I do not feel able to recommend it.The proposed increase of 5s. a week would give the 100 per cent, disabledunmarried ex-private 50s. a week which will be 10s. a week less than the similarminer. The married ex-private in employment who constitutes the vast majorityof war pensioners will, however, with wife&apos;s allowance of 10s. a week receive thesame rate viz., 60s. as the similar married miner who gets an allowance for his wife only when in hospital or unemployable; and this would remove one of themost glaring anomalies created by the miners scheme.A pproximate Cost  3J million a year.(2) Unemployability supplementThat the rate be raised from 20s. to 30s. a week (or 35s. if proposal(1) is not accepted).   (See Appendix II.)This will give the unemployable war pensioner a total of 80s. a week, theminimum amount to be received by the unemployable miner.Approximate Cost  370,000 or  480,000 a year but there would be a saving to the National Insurance Fund of nearly  200,000 a year.(3) Treatment AllowancesThat where the &quot; other rank &quot; war pensioner is ineligible for sick-ness benefit an additional 20s. a week be paid,- or where the rate of sickness benefit is paid at a modified rate, an additional allowance bepaid to bring it up to 20s.   (See Appendix III.)My predecessor, I believe, intended to recommend an all-round increase in thetreatment allowance rates so as to secure that the ex-service man should receivethe same amount as the miner viz., 60s. a week. I think it would be sufficient,however, if special assistance were given to men who are not eligible for sickness benefit or for sickness benefit of less than 20s. a week.Approximate Cost  250,000 a year.356533 2
(4) Pension of Widow over 40, invalid Widow and Widow with a Child orC hildrenThat the rate for the private&apos;s widow be raised by 5s. from 35s. to40s. a week and the rates of widows of men of ranks above that of privatebe raised to 40s. where they fall short of that amount. (See Appendix IV.)This proposal has the effect of wiping out compensation for rank and gives theprivate&apos;s widow the same rate as that of the Army Warrant Officer, Class I.It is therefore a slightly less expensive proposal than one to give an increase of5s. to every widow which I believe my predecessor had in mind.Approximate Cost  1J million a year..(5) Cost and Effective Date of proposals the approximate total cost of my proposals is in a full year between  5^million and  6 million with the prospect of decrease as the years go by. A gooddeal of preparation is necessary to give effect to a general increase in rates affectingsome 900,000 cases and I suggest that the improvements, if agreed, should take effect from the first pay day in October.14. I regard these proposals as moderate and fully justified. I am sure thatall my colleagues are agreed that even at a time when we are seeking to preventfurther rises in incomes, there is a minimum level below which the deserving andthe needy cannot be allowed to fall. Some of the improvements which I suggestare overdue while others result from the Supplementary Scheme for Miners. I feelquite satisfied that unless the proposals are accepted the campaign foreshadowedby Sir Ian Fraser will be pursued with the utmost vigour with the possible danger that the Government may in the end be forced to make even greater concessions.The ex-service community are, in the light of the Miners&apos; Scheme, lookingexpectantly for improvements in war pensions and unless they are forthcomingI fear that the growing tendency of the public to feel that the miners are becoming a privileged class will be intensified. As my predecessor reminded the Cabinet theminers are contributing only \ towards their supplements the remaining f beingcontributed by consumers of coal who include over a million war pensioners.15.   I sincerely hope that my colleagues will be able to accept all my proposals.H. A. M.Ministry of Pensions, S.W. 1.22nd July, 1948- APPENDIX IProposal increase of 5s. in the 100 per cent.
