THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret .P.(a.8^ 19827TH JULY. 19U.8CABINETREORGANISATION OP THE WHITE FISH industry memorandum bv the Secretary of State for Scotland ,anflthe Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesWe have considered the Report of the independentMinisters of the Committee appointed to consider the White fish industry   (C.P.(Li.8) 197) which rejects our proposals for the re-grouping of the catching and processing sides of the trawlerfishing industry-and the setting up of a White Fish ProductionBoard.     The main object of these proposals was to stimulate the economic development- of the industry, and in particular todeal with the situation obtaining in the industry where the nearwater trawlers are unable to pay their way.     The powersrecommended by the independent Ministers do not solve this problem.2e The power to give loans for the building of newtrawlers (paragraph 3 (a) of CP.(h8) 197) will not by itself be of much assistance, as the near water trawlers have been operating at a loss notwithstanding the increase in maximum prices authorised last- Sept-ember.     The question of providingsome compensation to the near water trawler - owners to enabletheir vessels to operate profitably has been considered at various times at the instance of the  trawler owners, but so farno satisfactory solution has been found.3* The power to give directions to catchers about thespacing of landings (paragraph 3 (b)) will not- increase the earnings of the catchers and may well, in certain circumstances,have the effect of reducing them.     This power also is one whichwe firmly believe should not be controlled by Civil Servants,involving, as it would, continuing interference with thecommercial operations of some 39h trawler owners, a very different problem from control by a White Fish Production Boardof a smaller group of trawler owners whose businesses had beenin the interval reorganised.h* As regards the powers to make regulations with a viewto improving the quality of fish and enforcing better standards of accommodation for crews on fishing vessels (paragraphs 3 (c),(d) and (e)), the former should contribute something to theeconomic well-being of the industry but the latter, thoughimportant and highly desirable, do not help the economic position.5o There remains the power to operate experimental vessels(paragraph 3 (g)) and generally to undertake development- of newprocesses and new equipment.     We agree that these powers are desirable, but reiterate our view that they would be&apos; bettercarried out by a White Fish Production Board than a Government-Department.COPY NO.-1-
6.     ^       We are unable to agree to the suggestion that a WhiteFish Executive should be set up (paragraph 6).     The name wouldbe misleading as it is not proposed to give the Executive anyadministrative or executive powers.     /my announcement aboutthe setting up of such a body would be taken by Membersrepresenting fishery constituencies, and the fishing industry generally,  as a substitute for the White Fish Commission, andwe feel sure the House would be sharply critical when it was explained that Ministers had in mind nothing more than an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee.     We feel that the setting up of such a body would introduce another cog into theadministrative machine which, on balance, might well lead to delay and would certainly place a heavier burden on the staffs of existing Departments.     In any case, officials of the fisheries Departments have at all times maintained close consultation with the Ministry of Food, and no useful purpose would appear to be served by setting up a formal body.7* We feel compelled therefore to record our opinionthat the proposals now put forward by the independent ministers may be regarded by the Members for fishing constituencies andthe industry as ineffective and may react adversely on the prestige of the Government.      If nevertheless the Cabinet feelthat they ore, in the main,  to be preferred in presentcircumstances to our proposals, we would strongly urge that co-ordination of the work of Departments be carried on as hitherto without the creation of a formal body for the purpose,and we should wish to reserve our position on the question ofthe establishment of a White Fish Production Board with a viewto further consideration being given to that proposal at alater date.A.W.T.W.27th July.   !Qk8
