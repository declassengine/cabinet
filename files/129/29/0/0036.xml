1HI8 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP PUS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (h.8) 22628th September, 19h8.ANTI-TANK RANGE AT ROSS LINKSMemorandum by the Minister of Town and Country PlanningAs my colleagues will be aware, I am responsible forarranging public local inquiries where there is opposition tothe proposals of a Service Department to acquire land fortraining, storage or accommodation purposes.      Such an inquiryhas been held into the proposals of the War Department for an anti-tank range at Ross Links in Northumberland,  in the vicinity of Holy Island, and I attach a copy of the report bySir Geoffrey Whiskard who held the inquiry.      On considerationof that report, I had,  in agreement with the Ministers immediately concerned, proposed in a paper to the Lord President&apos;s Committee(L.P.(h8) 7h) that the proposals of the War Department should he approved.      The Prime Minister, however, directed that thematter should be referred to the Cabinet for decision.      he asked whether it was really impossible to use for the necessaryanti-tank gunnery training some of the other ranges alreadyused for other types of artillery.2, At the inquiry objections were raised on the grounds of detriment to agriculture,  interference with fishing interestsand disturbance of bird sanctuaries.      Sir Geoffrey Whiskardconsidered that these objections were decidedly not of suchweight as to require abandonment of Ross Links,      The majorobjection was, however, from the Church of England and it is,I think,  enough to say on the other grounds of objection   that,whatever may be the detriment to agriculture,  there is noreason to believe that it would be any less serious if the range were moved elsewhere.      As regards fishing, byelaws willbe introduced for the safeguarding of fishing and other vesselspassing through the danger area.     No firing will take place onSaturdays and Sundays and arrangements will be made as far aspracticable whereby the fishermen will be able to haul and shoottheir tackle at least once on days on which firing will takeplace.      On the evidence available it is unlikely that the rangewill have any serious effects upon the neighbouring birdsanctuaries.3&quot; The issue therefore is twofold.      Is it practicable to use an existing artillery range instead of Ross Links?     Ifnot, is the opposition of the Church of England in itself asufficient reason for&apos; rejecting the proposal?COPY NO.CABINETh* To answer the first question it is necessary toconsider the place of Ross Links in the Army training programme.It is required for annual classification and training of the oneRegular and six Territorial Anti-Tank RegimentsR.A., drawn from
5. The War Department submit that during the war and before the present site at Ross Links was selected a carefulreconnaissance was made of the whole coast, but no other site-not already used for some other Service purpose could be foundwhich did not cause serious interference with coastal shipping and fishing.      On the other hand, the site at Ross Links is,  itappears, particularly suitable,  since it is composed of an areaof flat ground culminating in a series of low dunes at theseaward end of the Range, which form a natural though imperfectstop-butt.      Moreover, the presence of the Porne Islands forcescoastal shipping out to sea, and virtually frees the sea dangerarea from interference from shipping.6. I am assured that the question of alternatives has beenvery carefully considered, and in particular the possibility ofmaking use of other War Department Ranges.&apos;    The possible jointuse of the Air Ministry bombing range at Luce Bay was suggested and has been closeiy examined.      As a long-term arrangement thiswould be quite impracticable because of the intensive use to bemade of the range by the R.A.P.  and Ministry of Supply in lessthan two years.      Even in the short-term the range is unsuitable for anti-tank firing because the angle of fire is restricted byobstructions to four degrees, and in addition it is notNorthern, Scottish and Western Command.      The original post-warschedule of land required for military training included fouranti-tank Ranges:-.(a)    KIMMERIDG-E (isle of Purbeck) 5 which was withdrawnbecause it provided only reduced facilities for firing.      Therewas strong local opposition, mainly on grounds of amenity.(b) HARLECH, which was deleted in accordance with thedecision of the Ministerial Committee on Service Land Usage,taken on 19th December, 191+6,   (G-EN.  160/lst Meeting), in viewof the opposition to the proposal in Wales, and on theunderstanding that the Ranges at LYDD and ROSS LINKS would beretained.      The decision has been announced in the House andthe Range is being dismantled.(c) LYDD.(d) ROSS LINKS.At Lydd the War Department proposal is encounteringfirm opposition from the Rye Bay fishermen on the grounds thatthe increased danger area required by modern anti-tank guns islikely to deprive them of their livelihood.      Thus,  although-theoretically it would be possible to site the entire anti-tank commitment at Lydd,  this is not, in fact,  practicable forthe following reasons:-(i) It would involve almost continuous use of. the Range,during the hours of daylight for most of the year,and would, therefore, be quite unacceptable to thefishermen and coastal shipping.(ii)    The time taken in travelling by units from Northern,Scottish and Western Commands would result in an unacceptable loss of training time,  particularly inthe case of the Territorial Army.(iii)    Lydd will not in any event bo adequate when NationalService men begin to pass to the Reserve.
considered possible to fit Territorial Army training into the-R.A.F.  and Ministry of Supply programmes.      So far as otherartillery ranges are concerned the ricochet effect of highvelocity solid shot and the consequent size of the danger area is the great difficulty.     Moreover,  I am advised that evenif it were physically possible to fit this danger area into afield type  artillery   range it would not be possible tosuperimpose anti-tank training commitments on to the existingartillery ranges at Redesdale, Larkhill, Okehampton, orSonnybridge, all of which are fully used for their own type oftraining,, particularly during the peak period of the summer months when Territorial training is at its height.      Of theRoyal Armoured Corps ranges, Warcop is fully committed with thethree Arms Basic Training Units and with .T.A.  firing, whileEast Holme con only just cater for the Royal Armoured &apos;Corps atBovington.      The remaining two ranges,  at castle martin andKirkcudbright,  are also used to capacity for tank training.7. There seems therefore to be no practical alternative to the use of Ross Links for anti-tank training.      there remains however the strong opposition of the Church.      Thefact must be faced that this opposition is in no way allayed byprecautions to prevent physical interference with Holy Island.It is based on a much more intangible consideration - namely,the affront to religious sentiment of the intrusion of preparations for war into an area which by many members of theChurch is regarded as sacred, although Sir Geoffrey Whiskardsubmits the view that the associations,  properly regarded, arehistoric rather than sacred.      Even so,  the associationsattaching to this area and its natural beauty are such that onlyoverriding necessity would justify any disturbance of its peace.But once the War Department conclusion is accepted that thereis no alternative site possible for the anti-tank gunnerytraining programme which is vital to the defence of the country,it seems to me that this overriding necessity has beenestablished, and that the needs of national defence must beallowed to prevail.8. For these reasons,  the proposals of the War department should,  in my opinion, be approved.L.S.Ministry of Town and Country Planning,  S.W.1.28th September,  191+8.
*    243CONFIIKKTIALCOPY NO.   .MINISTRY OF TOM MD COUNTRY PLANNINGROSS LINKSUSE OF LAND BY THE WAR DEPARTMENTPUBLIC LOCAL INQUiRY AT COUNTY HALL, NEWCaiSILE-ON-TYNEWEDNESDAY, 16TH JUNE, 192,3REPORT OF SIR GEOFFREY WHISKARD. K.C.B. . K.C.M.G.The Rt. Hon. Lewis Silkin. M.P.Minister of Town and Country Planning.I have the honour to report that, in accordance with your instructions and Warrant of Appointment dated 7th June, 1948, I held a Public Local Inquiryfor the purpose of hearing representations as to the effect on the publicinterest of the proposal of the War, Department to use certain land at RossLinks in the County of Northumberland.The Inquiry was held in the Council Chamber, County Hall, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, beginning at 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, l6th June and ending on the same day.A list of the Authorities, Bodies or Persons who had given notice ofApp, their intention to make representations either through Counsel or other,     representative or in person is annexed, in the order in which they were heard,App. A map of the area concerned is also annexed,II.Marginal references in this Report are to pages of the Verbatim Report,unless otherwise stated,I visited the area on l th June, in the company of Major-general.Y.Whitfield, C.B. ,D.S.O. ,O.B.E., Chief of Staff, Northern Command and ofBrigadier J.L. Maxwell, C.B.E, ,M,C, ,C.R.A., Northern Command;   andBrigadier Maxwell explained to me the purposes for which it was designedto use the area, and the safety and other regulations which it was proposed should be made.     On the previous day I had visited the Fame Islands in thecompany of Mr. T. Russell Goddard, a distinguished ornithologist, who showedand explained to me the nesting habits and arrangements of the birds (it wasthen the middle of the nesting season, about a third of the hatch having taken place), and I was able to question three of the six permanent birdwatchers employed by the Fame Islands Committee of the National Trust as tothe observed effect of the use of the gun range at Ross Links during and since the war on the birds and their breeding habits.Ross Links is an area-of some 1,100 acres, bordering on highwater markand consisting of rough grazing and s*nd dunes.     From it can be seen theFame Islands, lying about five miles due East, and Holy Island, about 2-g-miles due North.     Bamborough Castle, about ^2 miles to the South-East, isclearly visible from the Links, as is also Lindisfarne Castle on Holy Island,It was stated in evidence that this is one of the very few points in this-73     Country from which two ancient castles ban be seen.   The views to sea, and
along the ooast, are quietly, but not excitingly, beautiful, and thereis a marked feeling of peacefulness - firing was not taking place when Iwas there.     The only visible evidence of the use of the land as a Rangewas a high watch tower, which did not seem to me to spoil the amenity ofthe neighbourhood to any sensible degree;    the trolley ways and targetpits are invisible until one actually comes upon then.The area which the War Department desire to retain is coloured greenon the map;    and in addition it is proposed to acquire the small areahatched red.     It has for the past five years been used, and it is proposedthat it should continue to be used, as an anti-tank gun range.     The targetsare on the sea shore, on the inland side of the sand dunes, between the twored lines running out to sea on the map, and th.^ firing points are at different distances, the maximum being 1,000 yards, inland from the targets.All well-aimed shots will be stopped by the sand dunes;   but as the Rangeis intended largely to be used for training recruits, it must be anticipatedthat a high proportion of shots will not be well-aimed.     &quot;Overs&quot; will fall into the a8ea of sea marked yellow on the map;   the majority of &quot;shorts&quot; willricochet over the sand dunes and will also fall into the sea;    but as the angle at which a ricochet will leave the ground cannot be foreseen, it hasbeen necessary to extend the danger area of the sea by the addition of theportions coloured red.     It is, humanly speaking, impossible that, unlessdeliberately aimed to do so, any shot could fall outside the limits of thedanger area. r-The maximum number of shots which it is practicable to fire in a day is 200, the average number being about 160.     Of these it is anticipatedthat possibly as many as fifty per cent will ricochet over the dunes intothe sea.The War Department, if allowed to retain the land, will permit it tocontinue to be used, as it has in the past been, and is now being, used,for the grazing of sheep and cattle.     It will, in &apos;jheir view, be unnecessary to exclude grazing stock from any part of it while firing is going on, except possibly from a portion of the area hatched red.     It is, in their view,extremely unlikely that any animal will be hit;   but if this should occurcompensation will be paid.Owing to the position off-shore of the Fame Islands,  the greatmajority of coast-wise shipping goes outside the Islands and does not enter the danger area at all.     Occasionally/,however, either under stress ofweather, or taking a short out to catch a tide, ships pass inside the islands and across the middle of the area.     Furthermore the best available fishinggrounds for crab and lobster fishing, which is the main local industry, lieinside the area or to the South of it, so that fishermen from Holy Islandhave to traverse the area.     Brigadier Maxwell explained to me that the war department have as yet made no bye-laws for the aroa un-er the MilitaryLands Act and the Defence Regulations;    at present, however, the safety regulations governing tho use of the Range prescribe that a constant watch,under the supervision of an officer, must be kept in the watch tower whilefiring is in progress, and that the moment any vessel crosses the boundary of the danger area, firing must cease and must not be resumed until the vessel has left the area.     An application had been made for the installation of radar;    and,  until radar is in use, no firing may take place unlessvisibility is such as to make the whole of $he danger area visible from thetower.     Notice is given, several days in advance, of tho days on which and the hours between which, firing will take place, and fishermen areexpected to, and in fact do, keep out of the area at those times;    but themilitary authorities had at present no power to enforce this.During my visit to the Farne Islands on the previous day, I observedthat the birds, except the eider ducks which sat close on their eggs even when nearly trodden upon, rose in clouds from their nests at our approach,
-    249&quot;but settled again within a few minutes,     Mr. Goddard informed me thatvisitors were allowed on most of the Islands during the whole year, includingthe nesting season (May, June and July), and were in fact fairly frequent,especially at week-ends, usually in parties of twelve (i.e. a full &quot;boat load);and that, apart from the loss of a percentage of the eggs from &quot;being troddenupon - in parts it was almost impossible to avoid treading on eggs - he hadno reason to suppose that the disturbance was harmful to the birds.     He had himself no evidence as to the effect of gun fire at the range during recentyears, although in fact the stock of birds had not decreased:   but thewatchers whom I questioned stated that the birds would leave their nests, as theyhad done at our approach, for the first few shots in the morning, but there-after appeared to disregard the gun fire altogether.The Inquiry.After deolaring the Inquiry open, I made a brief statement in the courseof which I read paragraphs 45-47 of the White Baper, Cmd. 7278, and pointedout that, while the Minister was anxious to give the fullest possible scopeto all who desired to make representations, the Inquiry was being held on thebasis that there was to be a range somewhere in the surrounding country,and that therefore general arguments against the use of any area whatsoeverin this country for military training, or arguments which would apply to any area wherever situated, would be out of order.     I then called upon Major-General Whitfield, representing the War Department, to explain for whatpurpose the area was required and how it would be used.General Whitfield, after emphasising the responsibility of the war department for the peace-time training of the Army - a responsibility which inevitably entailed opposition wherever the acquisition of land for thepurpose was required - explained the purpose and intended use of the range,8,    on the lines already set out above.     He then described the reasons forselecting this particular site for the range.     In all but very exceptionalgeographical circumstancnes - which did not exist in this part, at any rate,of Great Britain - an artillery range must have a very extensive danger area on the far side of the targets, over which restrictions must be imposed, whilefiring was in progress.     Clearly it was desirable, if possible, that this area should consist of sea rather than of land, and that the sea area soselected should not include any normal shipping route.     Owing to the positionof the Fame Islands, the danger area shown on -the map fulfilled thesedesiderata, and the War Department had sarfcisfied themselves that there was - -no other land-sea area along this coast which did fulfil them.     The war department were sensible of the strong objections to which this proposal must give rise, and had done their, best, to meet them.     In particular they had agreed, notwithstanding that week-ends are most important for Territorial,training, that no firing should take place on Saturdays and Sundays.It was at present intended to vise the range only during&apos;the summer months,and especially during May. June and July, only during the Say-time, and touse only armour-piercing (i. e. solid) shot, which did not explode;   but hecould not bind the military authorities.never to use the range in winter or at night, and never to fire H.E. Shell.       The range had been very care-fully sited so that Holy Island cn the one side and the Fame Islands on theother should be well outside the danger area.     Thus the interference withagriculture and shipping had been reduced to the minimum- he hoped that thebird sanctuary on the Fame Islands would not in fact be affected, and he hoped that the limitation of shooting to the months May-July, and the under-taking not to shoot on Saturday and Sundays would go some way at least to meeting the objections, of the Ecclesiastical Authorities.     Endeavours wouldbe made to reach agreement with the fishermen so as to limit as far aspossible the interference with fishing.The evidence and representations which followed may conveniently besummarised under five heads - I. Agriculture.    II. Fishing and Shipping.Ill, Tourist traffic.    IV. Ornithology and other scientific interests.V, Ecclesiastical and Historical considerations. .&apos;
I. Agriculture.Evidence was given that the nine farm cottages, all of an excellentquality, which are within a few hundred yards of the firing points, would &quot;beuninhabitable if the Links were to continue to be used as a range.    This wouldmean that the land of Ross Farm, some of the best and most fertile land in64     the North of England, must be cultivated, contrary to local custom, by labour which would have to come daily from some considerable distance; and, even ifsuch labour could be obtained, it would be inferior and there would be a lossof production.     It was stated that in fact it would be impossible to get evenitinerant labour to work for any length of time in the conditions which obtained during firing;   a single ploughman would no longer &quot;be able to control66     his team of horses, and sheep-dogs cowered in the houses and refused to work.These conditions existed not only on Ross Farm, but to a greater or less degreeon three other farms, covering with Res s Farm 3*500 acres of the most fertile66,    land in the County.     At Elwick Farm House, 1^ miles from the firing point,thirteen panes of glass were broken recently during one week of firing.Finally it was not even true that the grazing on the Links itself would not be64     interrupted.     It was the custom to use the Links for the breeding of storecattle, which were subsequently fattened off elsewhere on Ross Farm;   and inaddition 800 breeding ewes were run with the cows.     Neither cattle norsheep could &quot;breed and rear their produce on the Links if they were to be used as a range.II. Fishing and Shipping.The fishing off this part of the coast consists almost entirely ofcrab and lobster fishing.     Each boat is owned by a syndicate of two or threefishermen, and the bigger boats put down as many as 300 pots.     To haul thepots, re-bait and shoot them again takes not less than four hours, and inthe summer months the pots are hauled twice and even three times a day.Byelaws governing other similar ranges exempted &quot;any vessel entering orpassing through the sea area in the ordinary course of navigation&quot; from allrestriction.     General Whitfield presumed that similar beylaws would in due course be made for Ross Links;   but he was not prepared to agree that afishing boat going from pot to pot for fours hours within the danger area would be regarded as being in the area&quot; in the ordinary course of navigation&quot;;and in one set of byelaws (for castle martin) there was an express provision that during firing &quot;no vessel shall be employed in fishing in the sea area&quot;.General Whitfield, however, was confident that he could make arrangements with51     the fishermen which would enable them to shoot their pots at least once a day during firing periods;   and the representative of the Holy Island and53 sea houses fishermen agreed that such an arrangement would be a great help.The same representative, however, subsequently stated that in his, and hisclients&apos; opinion, fishing and firing could not co-exist.Fishing is the main or entire source of income of 30 fishermen with53     49   dependents in Holy Island, out of a total population of 238.     No similarfigures were given for sea houses.The various shipping objections were fully met by General Whitfield&apos;sstatement that there would be no restriction on any vessel entering the area in the ordinary course of navigation, and that while any such vessel was inthe area all firing would cease.III. Tourist Traffic.32 Of the 109 houses on Holy Island, 36 take in holiday lodgers,accommodating in all 400 visitors at a time.     The island is 2^- miles fromthe firing points, and it was stated in evidence that when firing was inprogress the windows of the houses rattled and there was a distinct earthtremor.     This Eagfofe^well deter holiday-makers from choosing the island for33-     their holiday.      The fact that there would be no firing on Saturdays and
Sundays would be a mitigation, but did not by any means entirely meet the tourist objection.Furthermore, the fishermen derived considerable additional income -up to  4 per boat per day at the height of the season - from taking visitors to the Farne Islands to see the birds.     (Two boats, each with twelvevisitors, arrived while Mr. Goddard and I were on the islands).     The route from-Holy Island to the Farne Islands lay right across the danger area;   andif pleasure boats were not allowed in the area during firing, this would34    involve serious loss to the people of Holy Island.     General Whitgieldthought it possible that pleasure boats going straight from Holy Island tothe Farne Islands and vice versa would be regarded as &quot;in the ordinary courseof navigation&quot;, but could give no definite assurance on the point.IV. Ornithology and other Scientific Interests.30 Evidence was given that a considerable -number of rare birds had been accustomed to breed on the Links, which was an area specially included inthe County of Northumberland Bird Protection Order, and that these birds hadto a considerable extent been driven away by the firing on the Links during and since the war.     I think;that it must be accepted that the use of the47     Links as a range means that ^he birds will cease to nest there;   but Iascertained that in-fact: there, is no rare bird which breeds or has bred on the links which does not also breed on the Farne Islands, and Mr. Goddard admitted that even if all the bird life were destroyed on the Links ir. would not be anirreparable loss from the ornithological point of view.As regards Fame Islands, I have already reported that from my ownobservations and from the experience of the bird watchers no serious or harm-ful disturbance to the birds is likely to be caused by gun-fire on the Links,. five miles distant.     Indeed it seems obvious that the birds are far more likely to be harmfully disturbed by visitors scrambling over their breeding -grounds during the nesting season;   but, subject to the payment of a landingfee of 2/6d., visitors are freely admitted to the islands by the Farne IslandsCommittee of the National Trust,A special point was, however, made by Mr. Goddard who feared thatif, contrary to the present intentions of&quot; the military authorities, H.E.42      shell were used, &quot;overs&quot; and, in some cases, ricochets explode on43      impact with the sea, and that the food supply of the bp\.vd;?, on the EarneIslands, which consists largely of sand-eels swimming on or near the surface,would be adversely affected.     I did not feel that any considerable weight should be attached to this objection.30, A certain amount of evidence was given as to objections from the31,     archaeological, ethnological, geological and botanical points of view,73      This was not, however, pressed, and I did not feel that objections on these aspects could be sustained.V. Ecclesiastical and Historical Considerations.The ecclesiastical and historical objections to the use of sucha site as this for a gun range are, from their nature., ir/possible to define with any precision, and can, moreover, be measured, only bysubjective, and not by objective, standards.       In the circumstances i will not attempt to summarise the evidence, but will refer you, Sir, tothe verbatim report of the statements made by the Eishc- of Newcastle and app.     Lord Eustace Percy (pp. 26-28), and to the letter, annexed in original,III      from Dr. G.M. Trevelyan, which was handed in by the representative of the37      Council for the Preservation of Rural England.Summing; Up.Leaving aside for the moment the ecclesiastical and historicalconsiderations involved, I feel that the objection under the first four of
-the five heads -under which I have summarised the evidence are decidedlyhot of&quot;such.weight that the War Department should &quot;be required to abandon-the proposal to use Ross Links as an artillery range.     The fanning ofRoss Bam,, and, to a less extent, of the other three farms mentioned, will undoubtedly be hampered, with, no doubt, some loss of production, at anyrate during the next few years;   but it does not appear to me that the effect upon agriculture will be worse if the range is continued at Ross Links than if it were moved elsewhere.     Similarly, while the local fishing industry and,to an unpredictable but not,- I feel, serious extent, the local tourist trafficwill be adversely affected, there must be comparable disturbance wherever the&quot;range is. situated, and the adverse effects in this case are very oonsider-ab3^ mitigated by the concession that no firing shall take place on Saturdaysand Sundays, and will be still further mitigated if the military authoritiescan make arrangements - and it should not, I think, &quot;be difficult to do so -whereby the fishermen are enabled to haul and shoot their nets at least onceon days on which firing is taking plaae.       The objections of the shippingauthor!ties,were, in effect, withdrawn.     It is no doubt the case that birdswhich have hitherto been accustomed to nest on the Links will.in course oftime desert the area;    but there is no species of any ornithological import-ance which nests on the Links which does not also nest, in considerably      .&apos;greater numbers, on the- Fame Islands, and no evidence was produced to showthat the value of the islands as a bird reserve will be at all adverselyaffectel by the continued existence of a gun range on the Links.     I do notbelieve that the other &quot;scientific1 interests on whose behalf representations were made will be to any material degree adversely affected.There remain the ecclesiastical and historical objections.     As tothese, I will only say that the historical fact that Holy Island was thebirthplace of Christianity in England seems to me to be an historical fact,and not to affect the &quot;sacredness&apos; of the district, but only its historicalinterest and importance;    and that I personally should not regard the religious establishments on the Island and in the neighbourhood as being moresacred, although they may be of greater historical interest, than any ParishChurch. \If it is decided to continue the use of the Links as a range, i recommend that it should be a mandatory condition on the War department that the concession that there shall be no firing on Saturdays and Sundaysshould not at any time be withdrawn.   -\
