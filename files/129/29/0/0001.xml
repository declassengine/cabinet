LETTER SUBMITTING REPORT20th July, 1948.The Right Hon. C. R. Attlee, C.H., M.P.,Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury.Sir,In February 1948 you appointed Sir Rowland Smith, Mr. GeorgeWansbrough and myself to be a committee to enquire into the procedure for obtaining aircraft for the three Airways Corporations, and later you addedLord Braintree to the Committee.Our terms of reference were as follows : &quot; To enquire into the arrangements for the obtaining of designs, forthe ordering of prototypes and for the production of aircraft required forthe service of the three Airways Corporations and to make recommendations for the improvement of these arrangements where necessary.&quot;We received written statements from the parties primarily concerned, viz.,the Ministry of Supply, the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Airways corporations and the Society of British Aircraft Constructors. We took verbal evidence fromrepresentatives of these organisations and from a number of other gentlemen.The names of those who appeared before us are set out in Appendix A to our report.We have also visited three aircraft firms, viz., the Bristol Aeroplane Co.Ltd., Handley Page Ltd. and the de Havilland Aircraft Co. Ltd.In your letters appointing us you indicated that you did not desire us tosubmit a formal report of the kind which is normally prepared for publication.Accordingly our report consists of a discussion of the issues leading up to our conclusions without the usual prefatory section dealing with the existing situationand the events giving rise to it. For ease of reference, however, we attach as appendices the written statements submitted to us.There is one further point to which I should refer. Your private secretary in his letter of 19th March, 1948, informed us that you did not wish us to feelthat we were under an obligation to examine broad questions of civil aviationpolicy going to the root of the Civil Aviation Act, 1946. Accordingly, youdesired that we should consider in the first instance whether an effective solutionof the problem could be found within the existing broad statutory frameworkand that only if this was impossible should we consider the wider proposals putforward by the Minister of Supply. We have been able to reach unanimousrecommendations without dealing with these proposals.In conclusion, I should like to place on record our very deep appreciation ofthe assistance and advice which has been given to us throughout our deliberationsby Mr. J. A. Drew, who has acted as our Secretary.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,J. HANBURY-WILLIAMS,Chairman.
REPORTINTRODUCTIONRole of the Airways corporations in our enquiry we have been struck by the widely different assumptions madeby witnesses about the aims of-the Airways Corporations and the way in-whichthey should fulfil them. On the one hand, the view is taken that, fundamentally,they are commercial organisations and must operate as such; on the other, thatthey are or should be the instruments of broad national policy in the pursuit of which normal commercial considerations must if necessary be subordinated toa variety of other considerations.2. A great deal depends on the view taken on this point, and we think itdesirable at the outset to state and explain the standpoint we have adopted. Weobserve that the Civil Aviation Act. 1946. requires the Corporations to developair transport services to the best advantage and to secure that &quot; the services provided by the Corporation are provided at reasonable charges.&quot; The terms&quot; best advantage &quot; and &quot; reasonable charges&quot; are not defined in the Act,but taking them at their face value they seem to us to amount to a directive to the Corporations to operate on normal commercial lines. We recognisethat, like some of the other nationalised corporations, they may have to do things which a private company would not undertake on account of the inadequate returnto be expected. For example, like Cables and Wireless, the Corporations mustoperate services for which there is relatively little commercial demand, but which,nevertheless, must be maintained for strategic purposes. Again, the Corpora-tions&apos; commercial activities may also be restricted in regard to the sources fromwhich they may purchase aircraft, and in other ways. However, although these factors may effect both the manner and the financial results of the Corporations&apos;operations, they do not in our view alter the commercial approach to their objective : rather do they emphasize the need for such an approach.3. If this be conceded, it follows that the Corporations are entitled to usecommercial methods and to the same freedom of action as any commercial organi-sation, consistent with other considerations of national policy including themaintenance of a strong aircraft industry. We recognise that neither side inthe controversy would quarrel with this statement, for everything depends on the weight assigned to &quot; considerations of national policy.&quot; The point we desire tomake, however, is that the onus of proof of national necessity ought to lie on thosewho would deny the Corporations freedom to procure their equipment in theirown way.Industrial Experience4. From our industrial experience we believe that the best results in con-structing complex equipment are obtained when user and producer are in close and direct association. We can best illustrate this by reference to the practice inthe shipping industry where, as in civil aviation, the operator&apos;s success depends toa large degree on the quality and characteristics of the equipment he employs.5. One of the most important factors in the success of British shipping hasbeen the intimate co-operation between shipowner and ship-builder. A cursorysurvey of the proceedings of learned and technical institutions of naval architects,marine engineers and shipbuilders show how a design is worked out and devolped in close collaboration between the two parties. After the main characteristicshave been settled there is a large number of mixed technical and commercialquestions to be answered; for example, whether this feature which adds pay-loadis worth its cost in terms of maintenance, or whether that feature whicli will improve performance is worth the penalty of increased fuel consumption. Eachof these questions, propounded as a rule&quot; by the builder, must be settled by theowner in the light of the special eonditionsof the service for which the vessel isrequired. No one can answer them so effectively as the owner; and, if it is his responsibility to operate the ship at a profit, so&quot; must it be his responsibility tomake the decisions.6. In the case of aircraft, the final result depends even more on this close collaboration between user and producer. Payload. particularly on long rangeaircraft, is a relatively small proportion of the total weight to&apos;be carried; and quite modest variations in the weight of structure, power plant or fittings&apos; maymake all the difference between commercial success and failure of the aircraft.This fact is borne out by the figures submitted to the Committee of Enquiry into35609 B *
the Tudor Aircraft; &quot;these showed that on the North Atlantic service there wasa most remarkable difference in the estimated operating results of the Tudor I ascompared with United States aircraft, though both types were of similar dimen-sions and weight. The same point is made in a recent letter to The Times bythe President of Canadair (Limited), in which a comparison is made between the tudor II and the D.C.^-M type.Corporations&apos; relations with constructors7. It has been put to us that in fact under the present system the corporations are given every facility for consultation with the constructors and indeed often have their own technical representatives stationed at the factories.Nevertheless, we have great sympathy with the Corporations&quot; contention that of itself this is not sufficient; for&quot; although the principle that the operator must havewhat he wants is admitted by the Ministry of Supply, the fact that the contractis placed by the Department is bound to diminish die Corporations&quot; authority indealing with the constructors. Thus, all modifications and changes requiredby the Corporations have to receive the Department&quot;s financial sanction; and while in many cases this is no doubt a mere formality, yet in dealings betweenthe constructor and the Corporation there is bound to be some sense of the presenceof the third party, and the constructor would be less than human if he did not pay regard to the possible attitude of the Department which provides a large part of his revenue.8. It therefore seems to us that, whatever may be the formal position of thethree parties, namely, the Ministry of Supply, the Corporations and theconstructors as defined in the contract for a civil aircraft, in practice there is inevitably an element of uncertainty about the respective fields of responsibilityof the Department and the Corporation, and perhaps some risk that theconstructor may play one off against the other. We think that a good deal of thepresent difficulty may be due to this situation and we are bound to sav that wecan see no way of improving matters short of relieving one of the parties ofresponsibility for the process of piloting the aircraft at least through itsproduction stages.It will be clear from what we have said that we are of opinion that theresponsibility,&apos; financial and otherwise, should be placed directly on theCorporation as user.PRODUCTION AIRCRAFTProcurement9. The arguments used by the Ministry of Supply in favour of their participation in the process of ordering civil aircraft relate mainly to the stage of construction of the prototype, and we shall have more to say about these arguments later in this report. The main argument advanced against the proposition that the Ministry of Supply should order the prototype and the corporations the production aircraft is that the production aircraft evolvesgradually out of the prototype; that the continual changes which the Ministryof Supply or the constructor may make in the prototype are bound to alter theproduction aircraft and that there would be complete confusion if the contracts for the two were entered into by separate purchasers.10. The problem would be relatively easy of solution if the Corporationcould wait until the prototype had proved itself, for, although the design would still be short of complete finality, the production aircraft could be specified with reasonable precision. But in general it is impossible to wait so long (perhapsthree or four years) and the usual practice is to place production orders as soonas possible after the detailed design of the prototype has been approved.Contracts for production aircraft11. We have given this problem careful consideration and we set out in thefollowing paragraphs our views on the way in which it might be solved. Webelieve these would be acceptable to the Corporations, to whom we are indebtedfor a valuable memorandum on the subject, and that they would also meet thedifficulties foreseen by the Ministry of Supply.12. At the stage at which the contract for the prototype is placed by theMinistry of Supply under existing arrangements there exists a&quot; specificationprepared by the firm, setting out the form of the aircraft^ its operational and
functional features, basic factors in design, :&amp;c, which is designated asTvpe &quot; X &quot;. At this stage the aircraft assumes an identity of its own, though itis&quot; not the subject of a detailed specification. As the work proceeds, however,the designer begins to give practical form to his project, aided by the mock-up and consultation with the operator. At a fairly early stage, productionspecifications are prepared for the use of the constructors&apos; drawing office and production staffs, and&quot; it may well be that at this&apos; point it would be possible to describe in sufficient detail the article which is to be bought, so that the corporations may enter into some form of agreement with the constructor.According to the circumstances of the case, and in particular the amount of detail in the type specification prepared by the constructor, this might take the formof a contract or an &quot;instruction to proceed.Much would depend on the stage at which it was decided to place the production order. If the prototypehad flown or was in an advanced stage of construction, the constructor might bein a position to quote a firm price or at least a price subject to certain limits ofvariation. In such a case no doubt a firm contract could be placed which couldrun side by side with the contract for the prototype aircraft.13. These arrangements might not be possible where the aircraft was ofa radically new type or perhaps where the production order was placed at a very early stage in the aircraft&apos;s history. In such cases an &quot; instruction to proceed &quot;would be issued, to be followed by a formal contract at a later stage. This, infact, would follow the practice of the Ministry of Supply in similar cases.14. In both arrangements it would be necessary to adopt some procedure for differentiating between costs which were appropriate to the prototype andthose which belonged to production. Broadly, this would be done by the prepara-tion of prototype and production specifications, but there would almost certainly be an area in which differentiation in detail would be needed. For example, jigsand fixtures built for construction of the prototype might have to be used for production purposes. Again, there might be developments in the design arisingout of flying experience with the prototype, for incorporation in the production aircraft. Another class of problem concerns the further development underMinistry of Supply contract of major components or functional elements, e.g.,power-operated controls or the power plant as a whole.15. All such matters can only be decided on their merits by discussion between the parties, i.e., the constructors, the Corporation, the Ministry of Supplyand, possibly, when airworthiness requirements are in question, the Air Regis-tration Board. In the great majority of cases, allocation of the cost to the proto-type or production contract ought not to present great difficulty since it would generally be clear whether the work wras being done primarily for the prototypeas such or for ultimate incorporation in the production aircraft.16. We do not suggest that the determination will always be easy or that other difficulties will not arise in a situation in which separate contracts arebeing placed for two articles, one of which is a development of the other. Never-theless, we believe that, given goodwill from all parties, the arrangements would work.17. Our view that it is possible to separate the prototype from the produc-tion aircraft is supported by B.O.A;C.&apos;s experience in purchasing the BoeingStratocruiser (a new design), and we understand that foreign airlines have beenable to negotiate directly with the Bristol Aeroplane Company and Airspeed forthe purchase of Type 175 and the Ambassador respectively. It may be that these orders were negotiated at a fairly late stage in the development of the prototype,but in the case of the Stratocruiser the order was placed long before the aircraft had undergone its flight tests.Use of the Ministry of Su2rply&apos;s Contracts Organisation18. It has been argued that even if a satisfactory division could be made between production and prototype aircraft, the Corporations could not hope toobtain contract staffs as skilled as those in the Ministry of Supply with theirimmense background of experience in dealing with aircraft firms, and that evenO We have seen a detailed type specification prepared for the Hermes IV. This is a document of over 100&apos; pages describing in great detail the materials, equipment and methods of construction to be used in the aircraft. We would see no difficulty in drawing up a contract onsuch a document.35609 b 2
if they could it would be an unnecessary duplication for such a staff to be setup. it is also suggested that if they dealt directly with the constructors, the corporations might be unable to secure prices as low as those which the Ministryof Supply can obtain.19. It seems to us that these arguments could be applied with almost equalforce to some of the other nationalised corporations, but so far as we know thereis no claim that for these reasons the Ministry of Supply should act as a centralprocurement agency for them. The Corporations will probably need to strengthen their purchasing organisation. The additional staff required should not be large,and there may be a corresponding saving in the Ministry of Supply; at leastthere would be a saving to the Corporations of the Ministry&apos;s purchasing chargeof 2 per cent, on the value of the aircraft purchased.On balance we think that if the Corporations established their own pur-chasing organisation, the net outcome might well be a reduction and not anincrease of handling cost, and therefore presumably also of the use of valuablepersonnel.20. As regards price negotiation, it is impossible, as the Ministry of Supplypoint out, to say categorically that the Department could obtain better prices thanthe Corporations. It is true that the procedure of the Ministry of Supply maymake sure that the constructor does not make an unreasonably large profit; itseems equally well framed to ensure that he does not make a loss. It does not by any means appear to ensure what ought to be the objective, namely, that the purchaser shall obtain the best possible value for money. The system of remunera-tion devised by the Ministry of Supply may be adequate for the purchase ofmilitary aircraft where the value of the article is demonstrated in terms very different from those which the Corporations must employ. But it is not wellsuited to the purchase of civil aircraft. Commercial operating results provide an excellent objective test of financial value; and, in addition, it is highly desirable for the operator to know the cost of his equipment at the earliest possible stage in his planning. We are confident that if the Corporations were permitted to buy direct, they could develop a more flexible and commercial type of procedure which, by penalising technical failure and extravagance, but rewarding low costand technical efficiency, would lead to a more economic overall result. (2)21. In general, we think that the approach of the Ministry of Supply mis-conceives the whole problem of purchasing. As we have pointed out above, a proper commercial approach by the Corporations will give them an objectivetest of price based on the earning capabilities of an aircraft. But further thanthat, we would say that the purchasing department of an efficient commercialconcern is no more likely than the contracts department of a Ministry to pay an excessive price in relation to what a product ought to cost. Departmental costingprocedure is likely to prevent excess profit. But excessive prices are more likelyto be due to uneconomic methods of production or to extravagant overhead coststhan to excessive profits. An efficient specialised purchasing department developing by experience and, above all, by comparison a sort of horse-sense about what a given product ought to cost is likely in the long run to be the more economical buyer.22. So far as the ordering of production aircraft is concerned, therefore,our general conclusion is that the Corporations should be permitted to purchaseproduction aircraft by direct negotiation with the constructors without the inter-vention of the Ministry of Supply; and that, given goodwill, it should be possibleto devise procedures which would avoid the confusion between prototype and production contracts which the Ministry of Supply fear would arise.The same procedure would apply to the purchase of spares by the Corpora-tions. We had evidence to show that the purchase of spares through the agency ofthe Ministry of Supply was unsatisfactory from the point of view of the corporations.(&quot;) In paragraph 2 (7) of the memorandum of the Ministry of Supply it is stated that, in negotiating prices, the Corporations would have to rely almost entirely on the subjective test of whether the aircraft could be operated on an effective economic basis, which would not necessarilyprove that the price was reasonable. This seems to suggest that the Ministry of Supply regard the possibility of a constructor making a good profit by supplying an aircraft of high economicmerit as something to be avoided, and that the very efficient producer ought to be on a par withthe less efficient. Surely this is not the ultimate&apos; criterion. What ought to be avoided is the excessive use of men and materials on making products which do not fulfil economic needs.
PROTOTYPESGeneral23. There is a range with infinite graduations from a prototype machinewhich is the &quot; first off &quot; on a production order, pushed ahead of the batch for trial purposes, to an experimental machine conceived and built solely for thepurpose of adding to the general body of technical knowledge. In what follows,the word &quot; prototype &quot; is used to describe an aircraft of the &quot; first off &quot; type,though not necessarily a purely conventional type : rather do we mean an aircraftwhose success may reasonably be hoped for, and which, if it fulfilled expectations,would go into commercial service.We were informed that each Corporation hoped to have not more than two orthree standard types of aircraft in service at one time, each of which wouldlast about five to seven years. It follows that the number of prototypes in development at any one time should be small.24. The preponderance of the arguments put to us by the Ministry ofSupply to justify retention of the existing arrangements for ordering aircraft,relate mainly to the early stages of development of a new type up to and includingthe completion of the prototype.   Thus they say: (a) That the financial resources required are normally beyond the capacity ofany aircraft constructor and, as recent American opinion has confirmed, can only be provided by Government.(&amp;) Economy is achieved by centralised buying.(c) The capacity of the aircraft industry must be apportioned between theneeds of the Fighting Services and those of civil aviation in the manner which appears best, and this is a task for the Ministry of Supply.(d) The  vital importance  of  the  aircraft industry  as  war potentialnecessitates Government planning and control,(c) Without the comprehensive technical knowledge and resources availableonly in the Ministry, the best aircraft will not be built.25. Leaving aside for the moment the financial point, the main argumentis that the Ministry of Supply must control the procurement of prototype ofcivil aircraft in the interests of defence and that with its considerable technicalorganisation it is in a much better position to achieve the best possible aircraftthan the Corporations.Civil development and the Fighting Services26. The Ministry of Supply argue that, because of the limited design capacity and research resources available in this country and the needs of the defence departments, the Corporations cannot be given an entirely free hand to place orders for prototypes where they choose. We are inclined to doubt whether theshortage of design and research facilities in the aircraft industry is any greaterthan in other engineering industries. Considering the wartime expansion of theaircraft industry one would a priori have expected it to be, comparativelyspeaking, rather comfortably supplied with these facilities. Yet the Ministryof Supply are exercising a detailed control which in other branches of theengineering industry no-one would think necessary. For example, the admiralty would not claim a formal right of veto over the placing of orders for large passen-ger liners requiring facilities which could be used for building battle-ships.The Ministry of Supply, as the major customer for military aircraft, is inan unrivalled position to influence the aircraft manufacturer. By its controlof testing facilities and so forth the Ministry could make things very difficult for a manufacturer who took an order for civil aircraft in flagrant opposition toits wishes. We see no need to reinforce its influence by any formal powers of approval.If the Ministry of Supply retains a formal right of approval or veto of the placing of orders by the Corporations there is a danger that the Ministry mayallocate orders with too much regard to existing unused capacity and not enoughregard to the possible expansion of efficient firms at the expense of the inefficient.Even if the Ministry of Supply has no desire to veto an order in its own interests it may feel that in granting approval it would appear to endorse the wisdom of placing a particular order and thus be chary of giving approval without-full investigation. .
The right solution seems to leave the Airways Corporations and the aircraftmanufacturers entirely free. The commercial prudence of both parties can be relied on to keep them within limits and the natural position of the Ministry ofSupply as duenna to the constructors gives it adequate powers of surveillance.27. As the matter has been presented to us it does not appear, in practice,that the concern of the Fighting Services with civil aircraft goes much beyond those questions of allocation of design and research facilities.The present trend of development of civil aircraft is in directions removed from military requirements; the interim types of post-war civil aircraft have been entirely developed from pro-existing military types, whereas the new types arepurely civil machines. So far as we are aware, the Fighting Services haveexpressed no interest in the latter, except perhaps in respect of particular featuressuch as pressurisation and gust and cloud warning devices. It appears that civil and military types are becoming more and more sharply differentiated, and that,except in research and development, their fields are not likely to overlap. Thereis, admittedly, a close connection between engines for civil and military types,but it is generally accepted that the best type of engine for a civil aircraft is one that has already been proved in military use.Role of the Ministry of Supply28. When we come to the argument that the Ministry of Supply can produce a better article than the Corporations we must be careful to distinguish two quite different functions, first the deployment of the best available technical knowledge and secondly the responsibility for decisions on each point, major and minor,technical, operational and commercial, as it arises in the course of construction.29. As to the first function, it is true that the Ministry of Supply haswithin its organisation a large technical staff and a mass of technical experience and knowledge which is perhaps unrivalled and certainly many times greaterthan that available within the Corporations. But again two different parts mustbe distinguished : (1) That which resides in the research and testing establishments, like theRoyal Aircraft Establishment and Boscombe Down, which are controlled by the Ministry of Supply.(2) That represented by the technical staffs at Headquarters.30. As regards the use of the first, there is no apparent reason why this knowledge should not be just as readily available to the Corporations and theconstructors as it is at the service of other parts of the Ministry of Supply.The resources of these establishments being limited, the Ministry might find it necessary- to &apos;&apos; ration &apos;&apos; would-be users in the national interest, but it can hardly be contended that their work on civil types would be more if the aircraft wereordered by the Corporations instead of by the Department.31. Some parallel to these arrangements may &quot;be found in the switchgearmanufacturing industry where test establishments owned by one manufacturerare made use of on a commercial basis by other manufacturers. It might besupposed that these testing stations and the specialist personnel operating them would be unlikely to give as valuable guidance to tie design staffs of their competitors as to the staff of their parent company; but experience shows thatthis is not so. Technician meets technician on a professional basis, and their common interest transcends commercial or organisational differences. As in thecase of the Ministry of Supply&apos;s establishments, there is sometimes difficulty in working into the time available the testing required by the parent companytogether with that required by their competitors. Nevertheless with goodwill and ingenuity the task is accomplished. This process may be easier for theMinistry of Supply, since the amount of work falling on the establishments islikely to be the same whether the Department or the Corporations place theorder.32. As regards the r61e of the technical staffs at headquarters, we agree atonce that they can contribute a good deal of assistance in the construction ofcivil aircraft which the Corporations or the constructors may find it difficult toobtain elsewhere. In particular, from a central position they can survey the wholefield of British Aviation and can give valuable guidance&quot;to constructors aboutnew developments which may be of value to them in developing their designs.The amount of work falling on this staff will not be increased if the Corporations
ISorder prototypes (indeed it may very well be diminished) and we cannot thinkthat their knowledge and- help would not readily be placed at the disposal ofthe Corporations.Moreover, it is easy to over-rate the contribution which the technical staffsat the Headquarters of the Ministry of Supply can make, viewed as a separate and independent factor. Nearly all the most successful service aircraft theMosquito, Spitfire and many others took shape, not from specifications designedby Departments but from the originating work of the constructors.33. We now turn to the arguments that the utilisation (as opposed toallocation) of the aircraft industry&apos;s capacity must be controlled by the Ministryof Supply in the interests of defence. The concern and interest of the Ministryof Supply with all developments in civil aviation is unquestioned, and as wehave said they can contribute to the success of civil types. But it does not seemto us that this necessarily involves close control and supervision by them of allthe stages in the production of a civil aircraft. It is agreed by the Corporationsthat in the initial stages of a project there should be close consultation withthe Department and that they should be influenced by the Department in selectingcapacity. It seems to us that this is adequate to ensure that other interests are not unduly prejudiced by the requirements of civil aviation.34. We are led to the conclusion that what we may term the organisationalarguments of the Ministry of Supply are not sufficiently strong to outweigh theadvantages which would accrue to the Corporations if they were permitted to order prototypes direct from the constructors. Indeed, it is, if anything, moreimportant that the Corporations should be allowed to order prototypes thanproduction aircraft. By the time the production aircraft are ordered, the designhas gone some way towards maturity and it is in the prototype stage thatthe greater part of the vital decisions must be taken; it is at this stage thatthe real responsibility of the air line operators must be engaged and the greatestultimate value will be derived from hard thinking and intelligent forward planning. The arrangements for co-ordinating the various interests concernedwhich we outline in paragraph 47 below seem to us to meet adequately the needsof the Departments.Record of the Corporations35. Several witnesses have expressed the opinion that the Corporations haveshown less foresight in planning than, say, the Ministry of Supply; and exampleshave been quoted to us (see Annex II of the Ministry of Supply&apos;s memorandum).They suggest first that the Corporations are not necessarily best fitted to determinetheir future requirements, and secondly, that it does not follow that what the corporations want is necessarily best for civil aviation as a whole.36. As regards the first of these suggestions we do not think that muchemphasis need be placed on the history of the immediate post-war years. Thecases of vacillation and lack of foresight on the part of the Corporations to which our attention was drawn and of a clearer-and steadier view by the Ministry ofSupply, occurred at a time when the Ministry of Supply was in the full vigourof its great war-time strength and the Corporations were building up their technical and operational organisation. We cannot conceive that the charge oflack of foresight would be true if the Corporations were manned with engineeringstaffs of the calibre necessary for the successful execution of those operating and planning responsibilities which still belong to them. Still less do we think it-good organisation to regard the Ministry of Supply as a kind of 1&apos; long stop &apos;&apos; toretrieve errors made by the Corporations in what is inescapably their business.If their staffs are not competent to undertake the task, as some witnesses havesuggested, the remedy is plain.37. We attach importance to. the retention of the Aircraft requirements and Contracts Committee, which was set up by the Corporations at the instanceof the Minister of Civil Aviation. This Committee ensures that the Corporationsmarch in step, in the formulation of their basic requirements.Export Prospects38. The other criticism that the control of &quot; first off &quot; prototypes by the corporations may affect the export prospects of the industry is more difficult to answer with assurance. It is not, however, a new danger, for if the dictum that&quot; the operator must have what he wants &quot; is given full weight, the design of new
types, e.g., the Comet and the Brabazon I, must have been affected by the particularrequirements of B.O.A.C. and possibly not in directions which would commendthe aircraft to foreign purchasers. Full and undivided control by the Corpora-tions may conceivably increase this danger, though on the other hand what suitsa Corporation will, prima facie, suit a foreign airline operating on similar routes.On balance, we are inclined to think that full control by the Corporations of their orders is likely to lead to the development of aircraft with better rather thanworse prospects of export sales. Before an order is placed for a new type, the corporations should be prepared to give full weight to the views of theconstructors and the Ministry of Supply about the export prospects of the type,and. if necessary, to compromise on the incorporation of unconventional featureswhich may not be in conformity with the general trend of foreign operators&apos;ideas. Indeed, the Corporations would be unwise not to do so, since export saleswould help in reducing the price of the aircraft to them and would certainlyreduce the proportion of the costs of producing the prototype to be borne by eachproduction model (see paragraph 42).Financing of Prototypes39. This point leads us to the question of the arrangements for financingprototypes ordered by the Corporations. It is clear that the sums involved arebeyond the ability of any constructor to provide, and for the same reason theycannot be provided by the Corporations. Obviously, the money would have to comefrom Government sources as at present, and it is necessary that means be devised which will be satisfactory to the Department providing the funds. Although wehave not examined this matter in detail, we do not feel that there should be anyfundamental difficulty in giving the Corporations funds outside the deficiencygrant. The Corporations might become the agents of the Government for theconstruction of agreed prototypes just as the Ministry of Supply is now the agentfor the provision of the Corporations&apos; aircraft. Our proposal is also similar tothe grant-in-aid arrangements whereby a sum of money is made available for expenditure by semi-autonomous Government agencies such as the British Council.It should not be impossible to devise some arrangement on these lines which would preserve the proprieties of official accounting and at the same time ensure thatthe Corporations were given the freedom of action we advocate.40. Whether the money should be provided by the Ministry of Supply or theMinistry of Civil Aviation is a matter on which we cannot advise. We may pointout, however, that the Ministry of Civil Aviation is statutorily responsible for organising and encouraging the design, development and production of civil aircraft. Constitutionally, therefore, it would be appropriate for the money tobe provided and controlled by that Department. In such an arrangement theCorporation concerned would act as their agents in much the same.way as theMinistry of Supply now acts as the executive agent of the Ministry of CivilAviation.41. We would like to make one qualification to the suggestion for theprovision of funds to the Corporations for the purpose of developing prototypes.We think it right that, if they find the sum allocated insufficient, normally theyshould be required to pay some proportion of the excess, possibly up to half. some such provision as this would tend to curb extravagance and insistence onunnecessary modifications.Further the contract with the constructor should be in a form which providesthat in appropriate circumstances some part of the excess costs, of a prototypeshall fall on the constructor himself.42. We have not attempted to deal with the question of recouping prototypecosts by loading the price of the production aircraft. Recent experience, both here and in the United States, suggests that it will be the exception for prototypecosts to be recovered in full. If they are not, part of them at all events will haveto be borne by the Exchequer, which provided the money in the first instance;but if export orders are obtained it may well be possible to recover some part by adding something to the price. Jf so, clearly such sums should be paid to theExchequer. It is in our view desirable that the Corporations should pay someproportion of the costs of prototypes for which they are responsible, even if &quot;at thisstage it is no more than a token contribution. It will not be possible to regard. civil aviation as fully self-supporting until the whole of the costs of prototypes arerecovered from the purchasers of aircraft, whether domestic or foreign.
9iiUnited States Experience. 43. Such an arrangement as we have described, would differ in form fromthat proposed in the United States by the Finletter Commission, set up by thePresident to recommend, inter alia, means for ensuring that development of aviation including civil aviation is not hindered by lack of private finance. Theyhave recommended the establishment of a Government Aircraft development corporation with powers to pay any of the development costs of civil aircraft and components considered to be necessary in the national interest, where privateenterprise cannot finance the work.44. This may seem at first to be indistinguishable in principle from thearrangement in this country under which such work is undertaken by the Ministryof Supply. But we cannot think that the Commission have willingly shut out theusers from the scheme (if indeed they have). It seems to us rather that they havebeen forced to their conclusion by the impossibility of choosing as the instrument for the expenditure of Government money one or more of the private airlinecompanies. We are differently situated in this country where there are choseninstruments, financed and under the general control of Government, which at thesame time can introduce user requirements at all stages of the development of a project.Experimental Aircraft45 It only remains for us to deal with the experimental aircraft. This islikely, for a number of reasons, to be a very small class. An experimental typemay be the precursor of a normal civil type, but at its inception it is unlikely tohave much interest for the civil operator. Moreover, in its development, basicaeronautical knowledge may be more important than the experience of the airlineoperator of what makes an economic and commercially attractive aircraft. Thus,it seems to us clear that such experimental types should be undertaken and financedas at present by the Ministry of Supply.46. As we have indicated above, however, there is no sharp dividing line between the two broad types we have distinguished. Thus, it is quite likely thatthe Brabazon I, and conceivably that the Comet, would at the outset have been regarded as experimental types, yet both have been ordered by the B.O.A.C.&quot; off the drawing board.&quot; Nevertheless, we believe that they are not now regarded with equal favour, and we suspect that, if they had complete freedom of action,B.O.A.C. would prefer not to take the Brabazon I on the ground that its consider-able growth in all-up weight makes its commercial success doubtful. Thereshould be such flexibility in the division of responsibility between the Ministryof Supply and the Corporations as would enable such difficulties to be dealt with.Thus, taking the example of the Brabazon I, under the system we propose theCorporation, if it had judged the project at its inception to be a reasonablespeculation, would have taken financial and other responsibility for it, and wouldhave obtained, by the appropriate machinery, a grant in aid from the Treasury forits development. If at a later stage its commercial prospects deteriorated andthe Corporations no longer thought it proper to accept responsibility for further expenditure on its development, they could on payment of proper cancellationcharges call a halt. Further development and expenditure, would only takeplace if the Ministry of Supply saw fit to accept responsibility for them and topay for them.General Organisation47. The general picture, as we see it, is that responsibility for the initiation of work on the design of new types of aircraft ought to rest primarily with thethree Airways Corporations and, more particularly, with the Aircraft Eequire-ments and Contracts Committee which they have set up.The Aircraft Eequirements and Contracts Committee of the three Corpora-tions should receive from individual Corporations their commercial and operational requirements in terms of traffic to be handled, routes, frequencies andexpected competition. The Committee should then formulate broad aircraft requirements to meet these needs and the Committee should have informal discussions with the Ministry of Supply on the technical aspects of the project and with the Ministry of Civil Aviation in its bearing on routes, aerodromes andon the periodical programmes and estimates of the Corporations.As proposed by the Corporations in Section K of their memorandum(Appendix B)   a project party would be formed, in consultation with both35609
Ministries, to discuss and agree the implications of the requirement as regardsresearch, design and development and this requirement would then be put to the interdepartmental Civil Aircraft Requirements Committee. It would be at thisstage that a decision would be taken that the Corporations should secure designsfrom aircraft manufacturers with a view to the preparations of a prototype inwhich the Corporations would be financially assisted by the Ministry of CivilAviation. Exceptionally, the design might be of a highly speculative and experimental character and it would then fall to the Ministry of Supply tocarry the matter further on the lines outlined in paragraphs 45 and 46 above.After these broad decisions had been taken under the aegis of the civil aircraft Requirements Committee further work would fall within the province of the Corporations or of the Ministry of Supply as the case might be.In this, and some previous paragraphs, we have framed our detailed recommendations in terms of existing pieces of administrative machinery. Thisis primarily to explain how the general principles we advocate can be applied in practice; and we realise that these detailed arrangements may have to be altered in the future to meet new circumstances.MISCELLANEOUSThe outlook of the constructors48. In our discussions with the Society of British Aircraft Constructorswe were impressed by their evident preference for dealing with the Ministryof Supply as principals for the production of both civil and military aircraft.To some extent this is no doubt due to the fact that military orders will always be many times greater than civil orders. It is also the case that some of theindividual firms concerned, e.g., Vickers, have experienced difficulties in dealingwith the Corporations.49. We feel, however, that there are other and more important reasonsfor this reluctance to disturb the present arrangements. We have indicated earlier in this report the certainty of return enjoyed by the average producer, without much regard to his efficiency. Added to this there is probably some unwillingnessto leave the familiar field of military technique for the relatively unfamiliarand more difficult sphere of civil production. This attitude is thrown into reliefby the evidence submitted by the de Havilland Aircraft Co., Ltd., which hasconcentrated for most of its peace-time history on civil aircraft and is alone indesiring to deal directly with the user without the intervention of the Ministryof Supply. They are also the first firm to accept a contract for a new type ofcivil aircraft and that a radically new type -with guaranteed price, performance and delivery clauses. They do not rely, according to their evidence, on the servicesof the headquarters staff of the Ministry of Supply, preferring to obtain their knowledge of requirements and developments in the civil field by close contact with operators in other countries as well as in the United Kingdom.We are bound to say that we find the attitude of this firm much more likelyto conduce to the success of the arrangements we advocate than that of the othermembers of the Society of British Aircraft Manufacturers, and we feel that agreater willingness on the part of the latter to adapt their methods of operation to commercial airline requirements as we have outlined them, both in the technical and the financial fields, would go far to ensure the smooth working of our recommendations.Relations of the parties50. It has been plain to us in the course of our enquiry that the presentcontroversy between the Corporations and the Ministry of Civil Aviation on theone hand and the Ministry of Supply and the majority of the constructors on theother has led to some deterioration of personal relations. We have not attempted to probe the reasons for this. Some of it may be the natural results of a sense ofdivided responsibility. Perhaps civil aviation has a larger proportion ofenthusiasts than other ways of life. Whatever might be the cause we are confident that, unless these differences of outlook are resolved and goodwill restored, neitherthe existing system nor that which we advocate will work satisfactorily.Position of the Ministry of Civil Aviation51. The Minister of Civil Aviation, under the Ministry of Civil AviationAct, 1945, is responsible for fostering the development of civil aviation includingthe design of civil aircraft.   The Ministry of Supply, however, control the
national research and development establishments, and we gather that in practice the statutory duties of the Minister of Civil Aviation in relation to civil aircraftdesign and development are undertaken by the Minister of Supply on an agencybasis. -52. Y/e appreciate that this may be a convenient and practical arrange-ment, but.we are not entirely clear what its effect is on the Ministry of CivilAviation&apos;s position in the day-to-day work of developing new.types of civil air-craft. So far as our recommendations are concerned, however, we do not thinkthat the Ministry of Civil Aviation need be formally joined in the arrangementswe have outlined for negotiations between the. Corporations, the Ministry ofSupply and the constructors. For example, they are not likely to be deeply con-cerned in matters of allocation of design capacity and practical issues bearing on the construction of the aircraft. Nevertheless, as the Department statutorilyresponsible for civil aviation generally they will no doubt feel it necessary tokeep in touch with the course of development of a civil type, and no doubt fromtime to time the Corporations will wish to enlist their help in negotiations withthe Ministry of Supply. It seems to us, however, that this function of generaloversight is adequately catered for in the proposals which we have outlined inparagraph 47 above and that in day-to-day dealings with the Ministry of supply on practical issues the Corporations should normally act directly and not throughthe Ministry of Civil Aviation.Obviously if it were decided that the sums to be allocated to the Corpora-tions for the development of prototypes should be borne on the Ministry of CivilAviation vote that Department would have to exercise a closer oversight over theprocess than we envisage above. This would not, however, affect the fundamentalnature of the division of function which we have tried to indicate; namely, thatthe Corporations with the Ministry of Supply would be responsible for executivematters, while the Ministry of Civil Aviation would be concerned mainly withgeneral policy, matters of organisation and financial control.GENERAL CONCLUSIONS53. For obvious reasons it is desirable that the operations of the airways corporation should be got on to a self-supporting basis as soon as possible. Itis of the highest importance to the achieving of this objective that the framework within which they function should be to the greatest possible degree conductive to their economic efficiency. The outstanding factors in the whole situationare these : (1) The characteristics of the aircraft they operate, and the capital costof these aircraft, are the most important determinants of their commercial success or failure.(2) If the Corporations have the abilities which they must have if they areto be able to plan and operate their lines with the best hope of success,they will inevitably also be in a better position than anybody elseto work out their design and development in collaboration with theconstructors, and to secure that the constructors give the best possiblevalue for money.&apos;(3) Since the Corporations have the responsibility for the economic operationof their lines, let them have also both the power and the responsibilityof procuring their own aircraft.All the other factors in the case seem to us to be of secondary importancecompared to these three major considerations. The execution without loss ofthe responsibilities which fall to the Corporations is likely at best to be difficultof &apos;achievement. If minor considerations, of dubious validity, are allowed to outweigh these simple, major considerations, it is quite unreasonable to expect the Corporations to become self-supporting within any foreseeable period oftime.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS54. &apos;(1) We believe that the pbjective of the Corporations is a commercialone and that in seeking it they are entitled to the maximum possible freedomof action (paragraphs 2 and 3).(2) Our industrial experience leads us to the conclusion that, in theconstruction of complex equipment, user and producer must be in close and directassociation (paragraph 4).   This applies particularly to aircraft (paragraph 6).35609 c 2
(3) We do not consider that the existing system provides for the necessarydegree of co-operation between user and producer. The present diffusion ofresponsibility as between the Ministry of Supply and the Corporations should beremoved by placing complete responsibility for the procurement of production aircraft on the Corporations (paragraphs 7 and 8). This would also apply to the procurement of spares (paragraph 22).(4) We see no reasons why a satisfactory scheme cannot be devised to meetthe difficulties foreseen by the Ministry of Supply in an arrangement under whichthe Corporations order production aircraft and spares. We outline in paragraphs11 to 17 proposals to meet this situation.(5) We see no reason why the Corporations should not undertake their owncontract work. No additional cost or duplication of staff should be involved;indeed the net outcome might well be a reduction of cost and staff (paragraphs18 and 19).(8) While we cannot say categorically that the, Corporations could obtainbetter prices than the Ministry of Supply, we believe that the introduction of a normal commercial procedure for fixing prices direct between user and producerwould tend to give better results than the present arrangements (paragraphs 20and 21).(7) We believe that the Corporations should be permitted to order prototypesof aircraft, other than purely experimental types (paragraph 23).(8) We think that, if the Corporations are allowed to order prototypes, theessential interests of the Ministry of Supply in the process can be preserved, andthat there should be no major difficulty in making available to the constructors andthe Corporations all the technical facilities which are applied to the developmentof civil types under the existing arrangements (paragraphs 24 to 34).(9) We are not impressed by the suggestions made to us that the Corporationshave not proved themselves to be the best judges of their requirements. Theinstances given in support of these suggestions relate mainly to the period when the Corporations were building up their organisations. In any case we regard it as bad organisation to look to the Ministry of Supply or some other body to retrieve possible errors by the Corporations in what is inescapably thebusiness of the latter (paragraphs 35 and 36).(10) We attach importance to the retention by the Corporations of their aircraft Requirements and Contracts Committee for the formulation of basicrequirements (paragraph 37).(11) There is some risk that full and undivided control by the Corporationsof a prototype may affect the export prospects of the type. We think that the corporations should be expected to consult the Ministry of Supply on this pointbefore orders are placed and if necessary to accept compromises on their individualrequirements in the interests of the export trade (paragraph 38).(12) Arrangements should be devised, possibly by way of grant-in-aid, forthe provision of funds to the Corporations to finance the development of aprototype, subject to the Corporations making some contribution to the cost andto the Corporations and the constructors bearing a substantial proportion ofany costs arising over and above the sum originally allocated for the purpose(paragraphs 39 to 42).(13) Purely experimental types should continue to be ordered by the Ministryof Supply and provision should be made under which the Ministry of Supplymight take over the development of prototypes ordered by the Corporations where these show a serious deterioration in commercial qualities but retain an importance from the point of view of aeronautical science. In such cases the Corporationsshould be required to pay appropriate cancellation charges as a condition of withdrawl from the contract (paragraphs 45 and 46).(14) We outline the administrative arrangements which could be emplyed to give effect to our recommendations (paragraph 47).(15) There are three matters bearing on our general conclusions to whichwe draw attention : (i) We feel that a greater willingness on the part of the majority of membersof the Society of British Aircraft Constructors to adapt their methodsof operation to commercial airline requirements would go far to ensurethe smooth working of our recommendations (paragraphs 48 and 49).(ii) There is need for an improvement of personal relations between the organisations on opposite sides in the present controversy and therestoration of goodwill is essential to the smooth working of our recommendations (paragraph 50).
(iii) We are satisfied that the arrangements we suggest are adequate to preserve the essential interests of. the Ministry of Civil Aviation inthe process of procuring aircraft for the Corporations (paragraphs 51and 52).(16) Finally, we draw attention to the main factors on which our recom-mendations are based: (paragraph 53).J.

Introductory(1) The proposition that the Airways Corporations should order their aircraftdirect from the manufacturers without the intervention of any third party hasmany superficial attractions. The aircraft are the Corporation^ main revenueearning asset and it is they who have to take the blame if their services areinferior or uneconomic. Yet on a closer study it will be found that so manyconsiderations are involved in the designing, development and production of a modern airliner that the problem is not capable of so easy a solution. If Britishairlines are to be supplied with the most efficient and up-to-date aircraft possible,and in the most economic manner, the participation of the Ministry of Supply isessential.   Orders for locomotives or road vehicles for the British Transport
Commission, or for ships for the mercantile marine, are misleading analogies,because the simple case of an order for standard aeroplanes of a type alreadyproved in service rarely arises. Indeed, it can, for the purpose of the presentdiscussion, be ignored. The problem is to find the best system for the designing,development and production of new types of aeroplanes to the requirements ofthe Corporations.(2) It is desirable to emphasise at the outset that the Corporations themselvesdecide what types of aeroplane they need, not the Ministry of Supply nor theMinistry of Civil Aviation. The Corporations also specify their detailed require-ments. The Ministry of Supply may give technical advice as to the best way ofrealising the Corporations&apos; requirements, but its policy in the case of civil aircraft,as in the case of military aircraft, is to leave it to the users to say what they want.2. The Need for Ministry of Supply Ordering(1) The participation of the Ministry of Supply in the ordering of new types of civil aircraft for the Corporations is essential for the following reasons : (a) The financial resources required are normally beyond the capacity of anyaircraft constructor.(b) The capacity of the aircraft industry must be apportioned between theneeds of the flying Services and those of civil aviation in the manner which appears best to serve the national interest.(c) Without the comprehensive technical knowledge and resources availableonly in the Ministry, the best aircraft will not be built.(d) Economy is achieved by centralised buying.(e) The vital importance of the aircraft industry as war potential necessitatesGovernment planning and control.(/) The special character of the export trade in aircraft involves the close co-ordination of manufacture for export with manufacture for the corporations.(2) These reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs. It is ofinterest to note that the system of leaving the work of development and production to the constructors and the air line operators, without Government &quot; interference &quot;seems to have failed conspicuously in the United States. Surely if any combination of manufacturers and operators should have been able to make a success of that system, it should have been those of the United States in the immediate post-war period, enjoying a monopoly of new designs in production and the support ofa far larger home market than any other nation. Yet large losses have been incurred by the aircraft industry, even on such successful sellers as theConstellation, and many new projects are being abandoned. The threat to national security implied in this weakening of the aircraft industry has been recognised by a Commission set up by President Truman which, in a reportentitled &quot; Survival in the Air Age,&quot; recommends the creation of a GovernmentAircraft Development Corporation with authority to pay all or any of the develop-ment costs of civil aircraft and components, which its Board (n.b., not the users,though they would no doubt be represented) judge to be necessary in the national interest.(3) The truth is that the cost of development of modern air liners is so highand the period of development so lengthy that few aircraft manufacturers can afford the sums at risk. Nor can the cost be borne by Corporations which haveto aim at reducing their dependence on Government subsidy as soon as possible.There is a wide measure of agreement (recently endorsed by the ParliamentarySelect Committee on Estimates) that the proper course is for the Ministry ofSupply to continue to place orders for prototypes and to bear, at any rate initially,the cost of development. It follows that the Ministry must retain theresponsibility for the way in which the money is spent. The total cost ofaeronautical research and development in the financial year 1948-49 is estimatedat about  33 million of which  12 million is attributable to civil aviation.(4) It might be argued that if they were given the necessary funds, the corporations could order prototypes themselves. But aeronautical research anddevelopment is not divisible between the various users of aircraft; this was oneof the reasons for the retention of the Ministry of Aircraft Production -now theMinistry of Supply-after the war as part of the permanent organisation ofGovernment. No-one would suggest that the RA.F. and the Royal Navy shouldeach have their separate aeronautical research and development organisations,and it would be equally absurd for civil aviation to set up its own.  Because we
are passing through a phase of rapid technical advance the volume of aeronauticaldevelopment work at the present time is high and every firm&apos;s design team hasplenty of work. Central planning is, therefore, necessary to ensure that allusers of aircraft get their fair share of the design resources of the country, notonly in quantity but in quality also, for the various teams are not of equal merit.In such circumstances there is every advantage in the responsibility beingexercised by a central Department, and it may be for this reason that the AirMinistry and the Admiralty have expressed themselves as strongly opposed toanv contracting out of the Government supply system by Civil Aviation.(5) During the present period of rapid technical progress it is particularly important, and yet particularly difficult, to make certain that each new designtakes full advantage of all the&quot; latest developments, not simply in aerodynamicsbut in general aeronautical knowledge, in power plant design, in instruments,radio, &amp;c. To achieve this calls for an up-to-date knowledge of those advances,an appreciation of future research trends, and power to deploy research anddevelopment effort in directions calculated to contribute most effectively to new aircraft designs. The Ministry of Supply with its wide responsibilities foraeronautical research and development, is in a unique position to help in all thesematters, and, while it is not its policy to design aircraft itself or relieve theaircraft firms of design responsibility, it must be closely concerned with suchfeatures of a civil aircraft as its aerodynamic and structural characteristics, its power plant, pressurisation, de-icing system, &amp;c. An aircraft firm working onits own with one of the Corporations as its customer could not have at its disposalfull knowledge of all the latest developments in the theory and practice ofaeronautical engineering (many of them necessarily secret at first) which are proceeding at other design firms and Ministry of Supply Establishmentsthroughout the country, e.g., the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, theAeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment, Boscombe Down, theNational Gas Turbine Establishment at Whetstone and the TelecommunicationsResearch Establishment at Malvern. Nor would it be practicable for the Ministryof Supply to remain passive in the matter, merely alloAving the Corporations to callin the assistance of its technical staff or its Establishments as and when theychose. The programmes of the Establishments have to be carefully planned to make use of a limited staff and they could not be run other than wastefully if they hadto cater for demands for ad hoc development work at short notice. Furthermore,it is only by the active participation in new projects that is obtained by the actualplacing of the contract for the purchase of the aircraft that the Ministry ofSupply can ensure that the latest knowledge is, in fact, brought to bear on thedevelopment of civil aircraft, and that, in turn, the lessons learned from civildevelopment work are applied to aeronautics as a whole.(6) It has from time to time been suggested that, while the Ministry ofSupply should remain responsible for development and the placing of orders forprototypes, the Corporations should be free to place production orders. The main difficulty with regard to such a compromise is that in the case of a new type, the processes of development and initial production are not in practice distinct andsuccessive phases, but overlap. However desirable it may be in theory to wait untilthe design is fully cleared, production orders are in fact usually placed beforeprototype development is completed, which means that work on the two contractsproceeds concurrently. In these circumstances if the Corporations ordered theproduction aircraft direct they would be ordering an article the nature of whichwould depend upon the outcome of the work being done under the Ministry&apos;sprototype contract. Under such a system confusion would result since theMinistry of Supply would be unable to control the divergence of the productionmodel from the&quot; prototype as a result of operators requirements incorporatedunder the production contract. The proposed arrangement would therefore beunworkable unless the Corporations deferred placing their orders until theprototypes had been built, tested, modified, and put into final shape, i.e., untilthe new aircraft had passed out of the development stages but they can rarelyif ever afford to wait as long as that.(7) Whether the Ministry obtains better prices than the Corporations wouldis a question on which there can be no conclusive evidence, but with aircraft, aswith other articles, the larger the order the cheaper the price, and in some instancesthe same types of aircraft, engines or equipment are required by more than oneCorporation and by the Services. In such circumstances, the presumption is thatadvantages will be secured by central purchase, Furthermore, through its intimate knowledge of the aircraft firms, and through the work of the Department^accountants and technical cost officers the Contracts Directorate of the Ministry
has advantages in negotiation which the individual Corporations could not enjoy.The right to make use of accountants and technical cost estimators is normallycovered by contract conditions, but if access by these officers should be refused,powers exist by direction under the Defence Regulations enabling the ministry to demand the necessary facilities. (In practice, of course, it is rarely necessaryto use these powers.) Such facilities for judging the reasonableness of the contractor^ quotations by reference to estimates of costs would not be availableto the Corporations acting on their own, and they would have to rely almost entirely on the subjective test of whether the aircraft could be operated on an acceptableeconomic basis, which would not necessarily prove that the price was reasonable.The Corporation^ only real weapon against what they might regard as an unfairprice would be to refuse to purchase, but the urgency of their need and the absenceof competitive supply would generally make this weapon useless. There can belittle doubt that the manufacturer&quot;s knowledge that his quotation will bescrutinised by Ministry of Supply officers with long experience in the negotiation of aircraft contracts, acts as a valuable moderating influence. It is also j^robablethat some saving in manpower results from the purchase of civil aircraft by theMinistry of Supply. Its contracts, progressing and inspection staff would notbe appreciably reduced if their activities were confined to orders for the Services.On the other hand, if orders were placed direct by the Corporations, the latter would probably need to increase their staff.(8) Finally, considerations affecting wider national interests than thoseof particular Corporations are involved in aircraft development and production.The maintenance of a healthy and balanced aircraft industry on an adequate scale without undue demands on the public purse is of vital importance to national security, and calls for the careful planning and integration of civil and military aircraft production. Again, aircraft exports are of great importance, and it maybe desirable that the production of particular civil types with big exportpotentialities should be assisted or stimulated; certainly it must be the aim tosecure that types chosen for British air services should, as far as practicable, be those which also have good export prospects. Owing to the heavy cost ofdevelopment, the production of new civil transport types for export alone is rarelyfeasible. These are matters in which the Ministry of Supply has a direct responsibility and in which it is assisted by the fact that the ordering of aircraft for the civil airline Corporations is in its hands.3. Present Practice(1) The present system of ordering has not been devised suddenly but isthe result of evolution over a period of years (interrupted by the war) duringwhich experience in civil aviation was being slowly, and often painfullyaccumulated. A short historical outline of the main steps leading up to thepresent position is given in Annex 1.(2) In spite of the lack of agreement between Ministry of Supply, Ministryof Civil Aviation and the Corporations on what the ordering procedure shouldbe, and the frustrations resulting from lack of whole-hearted co-operation, acertain modus operand/, has of course been achieved in practice. The followinggeneralisations are possible with regard to the stages through which, under present arrangements, a project for a new civil aircraft passes.(3) Each  Corporation  is  responsible  for  planning its  own  long-term requirements, i.e., for assessing probable future traffic demands, the proportion ofthe traffic which it is likely to attract in competition with other Air Lines, the carrying capacity which will be needed and whether in the form of large, mediumor small aircraft, the dates when its existing fleets will require replacement andthe general characteristics required in the replacement types.   In undertakingsuch long-term planning, the Corporations must obviously co-ojDerate closely withthe Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Ministry of Supply, the former, forexample, being the authority on aerodromes, radio aids and other ground facilities,and the latter on questions affecting aircraft development and production.  Suchco-operation can take place either through the formal machinery of the I.C.A.R.Committee (see Annex 1 paragraph 10) or by informal consultation with thepersons concerned.   In practice B.E.A.C. is the only Corporation which has, sofar, put forward a comprehensive long-term plan, which it did to the I.C.A.R.Committee in November 1947 showing in detail the aircraft which it is proposedto utilise over the period to the end of 1956.  LTnfortunately, many of the assump-tions on which this plan was framed have already been falsified by circumstances35609
outside B.E.A.C.&apos;s control, such as the severe restrictions imposed on foreigntravel. The Director General of Long Term Planning in the Ministry of CivilAviation (Mr. Peter Masefield) submitted to the I.C.A.R. Committee in July1947 a study on the probable aircraft situation on all routes to the end of I960but it appears to have been regarded by the Corporations as somewhat academicand the problem of how to secure satisfactory long-term planning requirementsstill remains to be solved. It is generally recognised that types to succeed thosewhich were initiated by the Brabazon Committee ought to be put in hand in thenear future but, apart from the Medium and Long Range Empire types referredto in paragraphs 3 (4), no new requirements appear to be coining forward.(4) It follows from the Corporations&apos; responsibility for planning their long-term aircraft needs that they are also responsible for formulating the initialoutline requirements for new types. This does not preclude proposals being madeby the Ministry of Supply or by the aircraft industry. In fact, only one entirely new type has so far been initiated by a Corporation, namely the Medium Range(Empire) aircraft by B.O.A.C. The Ministry of Supply in consultation withMX.A. have suggested the development of a Long Range (Empire) type whichmight make use of a novel form of engine in course of development under one ofits aero engine contracts, and design studies submitted by three firms are nowunder consideration. Although no case has actually arisen, since the formationof the Corporations, of an aircraft firm putting forward proposals for a new type,there is no reason why this should not happen in the future as it has in the past(for instance, A. V. Roe&apos;s proposal to build the Tudor and Saunders Roe&apos;proposal to build the S.R. 45 Transatlantic flying boat).(5) An outline requirement will specify such broad features as payload,passenger accommodation, range, speed, operating height, take-off and landingperformance, &amp;c. Modern airliners are, of course, extremely complex and expen-sive, and in the largest class it is necessary to aim at an operational life of as longas ten years with a utilisation rate of 3,000 hours or more per annum. It is oftenvery difficult to draw up the requirement in such a way as to secure the best possible blend of courage in exploiting new technical advances, and prudence inconsolidating the ground already won. Design studies (for which firms receivepayment from M.O.S.) may be called for to assist the Corporation in reaching adecision on the broad characteristics required. Even if the Corporation is confi-dent as to its requirements, it may be desirable to obtain, by means of designstudies, the expert advice of designers.(6) When the project has reached the stage at which the Corporation^ broadrequirements are known, it is discussed by the IX.A.R. Committee, and if that committee agree that the project is one on which efforts should be concentrated,the outline statement of requirements (with any amendments which may have beenagreed) is put out to tender by the Ministry of Supply to a number of firms inthe aircraft industry, the selection of firms being decided in the light of the designcapacity available and of any preference which the Corporation may express.It is not possible in view of the present calls on design capacity to put every newdesign out to tender to the whole industry, but enough firms are selected to obtainthe advantages of competition. The invitation to tender will call upon the firmto provide a full description of the aircraft which it would propose to build tomeet the outline requirement, together with information as to prices and deliverydates for one or more prototypes, or for a production order for alternative quanti-ties according to the size of fleet required by the Corporation.(7) Copies of the design tenders when received are circulated by the Ministryof Supply to all concerned with a view to consideration at a Tender DesignConference, at which the Chair is normally taken by the Principal Director of technical Development (Aircraft), Ministiy of Supply, or his representative, andat which M.C.A. and the Corporations are represented. The object of theConference is to place the tenders received in order of. merit. Although firms are not normally prepared to commit themselves to definite quotations at thisstage for prototypes or production aircraft, the indications which they give ofthe contract basis they would propose and of the probable economics of the aircraftenable some consideration to be given to the financial aspect. Technical factorsare, however, necessarily predominant in the discussion at this stage, and normallythe project which will be placed first in order of merit is that which appears to contain the best all-round combination of features satisfying the requirementslaid down in the outline specification. It may be found that none of the tenderssatisfy completely the requirements laid down; on the other hand, firms may have considered that the outline requirement was too unambitious in some respects andoffer something better.
(8) The amount of first-class design and development capacity available inthe industry will continue for many years to be inadequate to meet the totaldemands likely to be made on it, and it is an important function of the Ministryof Supply to ensure that each of the main customers, viz., the R.A.F., the ISiavy and civil Aviation, obtains its due share. This calls, in the first place, for planning ofthe resources available in the industry, particularly in skilled man-power, suchas draughtsmen, stressmen, aerodynamicists, &amp;c, and also of the scientific andtechnical staffs at Ministry of Supply Headquarters and its Establishments. Anew aircraft project whether civil or military must, therefore, be considered fromthe point of view of how it can best be fitted into the programme without detriment to other requirements, and, also, whether the preferred design firm can undertake the work without sacrificing other important commitments and without unfairnessto the other claimants on its capacity. The machinery which has been devised for settling these problems consists of a research and Development programme committee under the chairmanship of the Controller of Supplies (Aircraft),Ministry of Supply, on which the Air Ministry, the Admiralty, the War Officeand the Ministry of Civil Aviation are represented. It has also been agreedthat when a particular requirement of one of the Corporations is to be discussed,that Corporation shall be invited to send its own representative. The research and Development Programme Committee decides whether it can approve theallocation of a development project to a particular firm. It aims at obtainingunanimous agreement on its decisions, and has hitherto been successful in this,but if a dispute arose which it could not settle, reference to Ministers, or in thelast resort to the Cabinet, would be necessary.(9) After a particular design tender has been approved for acceptance, the firm concerned is asked to draw up a specification of the aircraft and agree this with the Ministry of Supply and the operator. Detailed instructions are given as to the form in which the specification should be prepared in the light of inter-national regulations and air-worthiness requirements.(10) Discussions take place at this stage as to the probable total number of aircraft of the new type which will be required initially by the Corporations andwhen they are likely to go into service. The total requirement is normally approvedby the I.C.A.R, Committee.(11) Preliminary negotiations take place to ascertain whether agreement canbe reached at the outset between the Corporation, the firm and the Ministry ofSupply regarding specification, price, guaranteed performance and delivery datesfor production aircraft, or whether it is necessary first to place a prototype order.If the firm is prepared to proceed with a guaranteed production contractimmediately, the Director of Contracts, Ministry of Supply, would negotiate its terms, acting as agent of the Corporation concerned, in accordance with the PrimeMinisters Directive. If the new type is intrinsically of great aeronautical interest the Ministry of Supply may wish to retain the first one or two aircraft off theproduction line and use them for general research and development purposes afterthe initial testing period necessary to prove the type. If so, the number requiredin this way will be included in the contract as a separate item, and the department will be recorded as principal in respect of the purchase of these. ITnder a production contract of this nature, the purchaser normally has the right to reject,the aircraft altogether if they do not meet the specification and guaranteedperformance requirements, and to receive liquidated damages if they do not meetthe guaranteed delivery dates. The firm will, of course, have to bear the lossif its costs exceed the agreed fixed price. The Corporation, on the other hand, is bound to accept the aircraft if the terms of the contract are fulfilled, or alterna-tively pay the full costs of cancellation. Modifications may become necessary afterthe specification has been agreed. The terms of the contract, including the guarantees, may therefore be varied during the course of construction by agree-ment between the parties concerned. Provision is frequently made for payment to the manufacturer (including any progress payments which may be agreed) bythe Corporation direct.(12) Whether, and at what stage, a production contract of this kind can beplaced depends on the willingness of the aircraft constructor to take on the obliga-tions involved, the readiness of the operator to accept guarantees of performance and delivery which allow reasonable margins for unforeseen set-backs and, ofcourse, on the ability of all parties, under these conditions, to reach agreement on price. In cases where the Corporation wishes production to be put in hand asa matter of urgency, and is prepared to assume some preliminary financial liability in advance of a final contract, an Instruct? m to Proceed is issued to the firm by35609 d 2
the Ministry of Supply, acting as agents for the Corporation. Such an instruction to Proceed incorporates as many of the final contract conditions as can be agreed at that stage and is itself contractually binding.(13) Cases in which firms are prepared to enter into a guaranteed productioncontract at the outset of a new scheme are, and will probably remain, comparativelyrare. Manufacturers are not normally in a position to offer guarantees of performance, price and delivery until development has proceeded far enough toenable them to see clearly how &quot;the aircraft is likely to turn out. Moreover, the risks and expense involved in developing a new civil transport aircraft in thesedays are out of all proportion to the return the manufacturer is likely to secureon the limited number of production aircraft the Corporations are likely to want.The manufacturer will therefore normally be prepared to proceed with the projectonly on the basis of first receiving a prototype contract from the Ministry ofSupply against which the bulk of the development cost can be charged. In placingcontracts for prototypes the Ministry of Supply acts as principal and not as agentseither of the Corporation for whom the type is intended, nor of the Ministry ofCivil Aviation. The expenditure is charged to the appropriate sub-head of theMinistry of Supply Vote. It is late? amortised, as far as practicable, overproduction aircraft, the firm paying the Department an agreed sum per aircraftsold, so that in the case of a successful and fully economic type the costs ofdevelopment will ultimately be passed on to the operators. Such recovery can inpractice only be partial at the present time, however, owing to the fact that civilaviation is still largely in the pioneering stage and is not economically self-supporting, and the Ministry of Supply consider that this situation should beaccepted for the benefit of civil aviation in the future and also because of theimportant contribution which it makes to the maintenance of war potential.(14) The design and construction of prototypes may take several years and during this period the closest co-operation is necessary between the firm, theMinistry of Supply and its Establishments and. the Corporation which will operate the aircraft. It &quot;is the responsibility of the Principal Director of technical development (Aircraft) and the Director General of Aircraft Supply to plan and progress the project in all its stages and to ensure that the firm receives allpossible assistance. Wind tunnel tests are frequently carried out at R.A.E.Farnborough and the programme of this and other Establishments have to be carefully planned to make the best use of the limited staff and facilities available.Regular meetings of all concerned are held to review progress and to solveproblems which have arisen in the course of development and which may threaten to set back the estimated dates of completion. Monthly reports are circulated bythe Ministry of Supply describing the stage which each project has reached.(15) After the flight of the first prototype a protracted period of testingbegins. The initial phase, covering general performance testing and handlingtrials, is carried out as far as possible at the manufacturer^ works, but aircraftfirms generally do not possess adequate facilities for the complete testing of their products for example, the airfield at A. V. Roe, Limited, Woodford, was notlarge enough for full load tests of the Tudor to be carried out there. Moreover,aerodynamic problems are sometimes encountered requiring specialised knowledgebeyond the contractors resources. In any event it is desirable that at the appro-priate stage the aircraft should pass into the hands of an impartial testingauthority. The Air Registration Board are responsible for advising the Ministerof Civil Aviation as to the airworthiness of all civil aircraft, but while they super-vise testing carried out by the manufacturers they are not at present equipped with the necessary organisation and facilities to carry out independent tests oftheir own. Moreover, the A.R.B. do not attempt to do more than confirm whethera certain minimum standard of airworthiness has been achieved. All prototypesordered by the Ministry of Supply go to the Aircraft and Armament ExperimentalEstablishment, Boscombe Down (in the case of land planes) or the Marine Experi-mental Establishment, Felixstowe (in the case of flying boats) for comprehensivetesting, not only as to compliance with specification requirements but also toprovide a general assessment of the merits of the aircraft. These Establishmentsensure uniformity of testing methods and standards. They also devise new testingtechniques as required by the progress of aeronautical science and they are atpresent the only organisations in this country with sufficient experience and facilities to do this.(16) After a prototype has successfully passed its general performance testingand handling trials and has met the requirements of the Air Registration board for the issue of a full Certificate of Airworthiness, further intensive flying will still normally be necessary to prove reliability, and operational trials will be
necessary to test the suitability of the aircraft for service on particular routes.Maintenance and ground handling characteristics will also have to be established.It is desirable that the Corporation should participate in these later stages oftesting and B.O.A.C. have a Development Unit at Hum for the purpose. the programmes and sequence of all flight trials is planned by a Flight Trials PlanningPanel led by the Director of Civil Aircraft Research and Development, Ministry ofSupply, on which the operators, M.C.A., the A.R.B. and M. of S. testing Estab-lishments are all represented. Discussions are still proceeding as to the apportionment of the cost of test flying, but it is recognised that the major partof it must be borne by the Ministry of Supply.(17) The question of the timing of an initial production order in cases whereprototypes have been ordered raises difficult issues. If the manufacturer is notprepared to enter into a guaranteed contract of the kind described in para-graph 3 (11) above, the most prudent course is to await the results of prototypedevelopment and order production aircraft only when it is clear that the type willbe satisfactory without major alterations. When that point has been reached the specification can be written in considerable detail and production can proceed without the fear that material and effort will be wasted owing to the need to incorporate extensive modifications on the production line. The type may, how-ever. be so urgently required by the operator for purposes of meeting competitionthat he is prepared to take risks in the hope of advancing the date when it canbe introduced into service. On the other hand, the aircraft manufacturer maynot be prepared to reserve production capacity unless he receives a firm order at anearly stage, or he may have received competing offers from overseas operators whoare interested in the new type. All these factors make it necessary that thereshould be complete agreement between the various parties as to the timing ofproduction orders whether guarantees of performance and delivery are obtainableor not.(18) Production programmes of aircraft for the Corporations have to become-ordinated with those of aircraft for the Services and for export. This is theresponsibility of the Ministry of Supply and involves the problems of allocatingthe production capacity of a particular factory between the different types of aircraft which it may be producing, and deciding how deliveries of a particulartype shall be allocated between the different user interests the Air Ministry,Admiralty, the Corporations, the manufacturers (for private sales includingexports) and others. Complex issues frequently arise which require inter-Departmental discussion before they can be resolved for example, should A. V.Roe, Ltd., be allowed to offer early delivery of Tudor aircraft to an Argentineoperator in order to obtain valuable export business, if this may mean some set-backin deliveries to British South American Airways, with whom the ArgentineCompany is in competition on the South Atlantic 1(19) In the past an elaborate procedure has been necessary to deal with modifications incorporated on the production line in the case of aircraft, ordersfor which were placed before the specification could be closely defined. In con-tracts which contain guarantees of performance, however, the specification hasto be defined at the outset and modifications subsequently requested by the pur-chaser have to be the subject of negotiation as to their effect on price, deliverydates and performance.(20) Inspection of production aircraft to ensure that they conform with thestandard prescribed in the contract has, in the past, normally been the function of the A.I.D. In some new contracts for civil aircraft, however, the requirement for A.I.D. inspection has been deleted at the request of the operator and provision is made only for inspection in accordance with the requirements laid down by theAir Registration Board for purposes of the issue of a Certificate of Airworthiness,and for testing by the Corporation as to compliance with specificationrequirements.(21) On completion of a production aircraft and certification in accordancewith the contract, the operator normally arranges to collect the aircraft at the manufacturer^ works. A claim is subsequently rendered to the Corporation bythe Ministry of Supply in respect of Departmental Expenses, normally assessed at per cent, of the contract value, to cover the cost of negotiation, inspection,progressing, &amp;c.(22) Spare engines, propellers, power plant assemblies, &amp;c, are ordered bythe Ministry of Supply on the basis of specific requirements stated by the operator.Modified arrangements have, however, been made with regard to other spares toenable the operator to have direct contact with the supplier, while, at the same tfme,preserving the advantages in price negotiation which result from Ministry of
Supply ordering. &quot;Blanket&quot; contracts are placed with aircraft and enginefirms which authorise those firms to supply direct against all requirements notified to them by the operator. Prices, however, are to be fixed by the Director of contracts, Ministry of Supply. This system has been criticised by the Corpora-tions, and particularly by British European Airways in their Annual Report for period ended 31st March, 1947, as leading to delay in price fixing and thuspreventing the Corporations from finalising their accounts. Proposals were madeby the Ministry of Supply to the Ministry of Civil Aviation on 30th January, 1948,with a view to overcoming these difficulties, and discussions with the threeCorporations are proceeding.4. Weaknesses of Present System(1) The most obvious weakness in the present system arises from the factthat the Corporations do not agree with the policy whereby production aircraft and spares are ordered on their behalf by the Ministry of Supply, and thereforedo not give their unstinted co-operation. Although there is a wide measure ofagreement on other parts of the procedure, the friction caused by the controversyon production orders has in varying degrees led to unsatisfactory relations betweenthe Corporations and the Ministry of Supply. The Corporations have at timesundertaken open propaganda against the system. The recently published annual reports and Accounts of British South American Airways and British european airways contain emphatic statements as to the points on which they disagreewith the present system.   For example, the former states : &quot; . . : . the present system of ordering aircraft through the Ministryof Supply is entirely contrary to the interests of the Corporation. It imposesa third party between the user and the manufacturer, causing delays and mis-understandings. It takes control from the Corporation but leaves it withthe responsibility. It adds to the cost of aircraft, as the manufacturer^price is loaded with departmental overheads. One of the prerequisites of successful airline operation is that the right aircraft shall be available atthe right time at the right price. Under the present system, the Corporationhas no control over price, is in the hands of the Ministry of Supply as to priority of deliveries, and is subject to very considerable interference as to design.&quot;(2) This attitude has, of course, seriously impeded the carrying out of thePrime Ministers Directive of 11th September, 1946, quoted in Annex I, para-graph 11 (5). For example, in January 1947 B.O.A.C. and B.S.A.A. pressed strongly that an order should be placed immediately for the D.H. 106. BothCorporations emphasised that they had not accepted the position that the M.O.S.should order aircraft on their behalf but agreed that the placing of an order inthis case could not await the outcome of discussions on ordering procedure and undertook to accept financial liability for a contract with a maximum price,negotiated by the Director of Contracts, of  250,000 for each aircraft. an instruction to Proceed with the supply of sixteen aircraft (two for the Ministryof Supply for research and development purposes, eight for B.O.A.C. and six for.S.A.A.) at a price not exceeding  250,000 each was issued to the firm inJanuary 1947 and was made subject to the final contract being concluded withina period of three months.(3) In April the Corporations requested that the conclusion of the finalcontract should be deferred until a decision had been reached on their claim to order aircraft direct, and it was eventually agreed that a two months&apos; extensionof the Instruction to Proceed should be negotiated. This covered the positionuntil the end of May. In June B.O.A.C. authorised the Department to concludethe final contract for their eight aircraft, but B.S.A.A. refused to give similarauthority in respect of their six machines. There was a danger that if the finalcontract was not concluded for the total of sixteen aircraft covered by the I.TP.de Havillands would increase their price. B.S.A.A. persisted, however, in their refusal to authorise M.O.S. to complete the contract on their behalf, and only asa result of an increase in B.O.A.C.&apos;s requirements by a further seventeen aircraft has anxiety regarding the possibility of an increase in price for the originalsixteen aircraft been removed. The conclusion of the final contract for B.S.A.A.is still in abeyance.(4) B.S.A.A. have also refused to comply with the procedure laid down forthe ordering of spares. &quot;Blanket&quot; spares, overhaul and modification setscontracts have been placed by the Ministry of Supply on behalf of the Corpora-tions. who have complete freedom to order what they require direct from the firmsunder these contracts, the Ministry of Supply being responsible only for price
fixing. B.S.A.A. have refused to make use of these contracts, or to consult force  -operate with the Department in any way on spares or overhaul orders. InMay 1947 the Corporation sent to the Director of Contracts a copy of a letter addressed to A. V. Roe, Ltd., in which they informed the firm that their orders should be treated as direct orders on a commercial basis. Nevertheless, inDecember 1947 the Chairman of B.S.A.A. wrote to the Parliamentary Secretary,M.C.A., complaining of difficulties which firms were having in obtaining rawmaterials to satisfy B.S.A.A. spares orders, and requesting that the Ministry ofSupply should be asked to assist on their behalf. Assistance of this kind can,of course, only be given when the Department is kept fully in the picture by theCorporation; it is impossible to ensure that adequate materials are available tomeet the B.S.A.A. orders when the Department has no knowledge of the itemsordered.(5) The Ministry of Supply have recognised that a satisfactory orderingprocedure cannot in practice be obtained without the willing consent of the operators. In order to secure co-operation they showed themselves willing, atthe time of the Musgrave Committee Report (see Annex I, paragraph 12 (3)),to make concessions beyond what they really felt to be justified. It became clear,however, that the concessions proposed would not achieve their object. A solutionby way of compromise on the lines then proposed would therefore have provedunworkable in practice.(6) It must not be supposed, however, that unwillingness on the part ofthe Corporations to co-operate in the present system is the only cause of troubleand that if the Corporations changed their attitude everything would worksmoothly. Experience shows that the three Corporations have found it extremelydifficult to make up their minds as to. their aircraft requirements and to refrain from altering their decisions frequently. Examples are given in Annex II.Preoccupied with the problems of organising their services and with the formidabledifficulties, under present conditions, of keeping their losses to a minimum, the corporations have shown no signs of being able to make a success of long-term planning in the field of civil aircraft development or of pursuing a resoluteand far-sighted procurement policy such as is needed if continuous progress isto be obtained. Thus the same complaints which the aircraft industry levelledat Imperial Airways before the war (see Annex I, paragraph 6 (1), footnote)would probably be repeated again, in spite of nationalisation, if the Corporationswere left to deal with the industry direct.(7) The examples given in Annex II show how unsatisfactory in practice isthe principle implied in the Civil Aviation Act, 1946, that the Corporations areto have &quot; what they want.&quot; The Ministry of Supply has to try and co-operate with unwilling partners, and to discharge its responsibility for the developmentof civil aircraft without having effective control. The Corporations may change their minds as often as they like; they may even decide not to order production aircraft at all after much money and effort has been spent in developing prototypesat their request.... The withdrawal of their support at a crucial stage maycompletely wreck the firm&apos;s plans for production to meet export as well as homerequirements.(8) The Prime Ministers Directive of September 1946 was principallydesigned to discourage frequent changes of mind on the part of the operatorsby ensuring that at any rate so far as production aircraft were concerned the corporations took full financial responsibility for their stated requirements fromthe outset and were not allowed scope for repudiating orders placed on their behalf, as it was already foreseen at that time might happen in the case of theTudors. It is too early to judge whether, in the long run, the Prime MinistersDirective would substantially improve matters, but it has certainly created acutedifficulties for &quot;the Ministry of Supply, both in regard to the requirement thatthe Ministry should act as agents of the Corporations and in the stipulationthat contracts should include guarantees of performance and delivery dates.(9) The precise nature of the &quot; agency &quot; has never been denned but the corporations, supported by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, have claimed thatthe relationship was intended to be a commercial one, and, as a consequence,the Ministry of Supply have found themselves placed in the difficult position of having to obtain the agreement of the Corporation, or Corporations, to everydetail of the contract. The whole process of negotiation has been lengthened bythe need for setting out proposals in writing, both to the Department^ principals(i.e., the Corporations1) on the one hand, and the contractor on the other hand,with frequent need for V round table &quot; conference to resolve points of difficulty.The position of the Director of Contracts in such negotiations would be unenviable
even if there were only one Corporation with which to deal; but with three ofsuch varying outlook as B.O.A.C., B.E.A.C. and B.S.A.A.C., the position becomeswell-night intolerable. Experience on the D.H.106 contract shows that it isof paramount importance, where more than one Corporation require the sameaircraft, that they should resolve between themselves any question of priorities,terms and conditions, in order to facilitate negotiations between Ministry ofSupply and the contractor and avoid running the risk of the latter playing onecustomer off against the other.(10) Aircraft firms have not, on the whole, been willing to enter into firmguarantees of performance and delivery on production orders for radically new-types of civil aircraft at the drawing board stage. De Havillands have done so in the case of the D.H.106 but have protected themselves by setting performancetargets which are less than they expect to obtain, and a delivery programme whichallows them a margin of no less than twelve months for unforeseen eventualities.Handley Page Limited, on the other hand, have advanced the argument that inthe absence of free market conditions for labour and materials a deliveryprogramme cannot be guaranteed, and that under present conditions of rapid progress in aeronautical technique it is equally difficult to give, or implement, a guaranteed performance. The Bristol Aeroplane Company in regard to the brabazon and Vickers Armstrong Limited in regard to the Viscount took theview that it was not possible to guarantee performance or delivery until the prototype aircraft had flown and proved successful. All firms have attempted to avoid the imposition of damages for lateness, though so far their resistance tothe Liquidated Damages Clause has been overcome provided that causes beyondthe contractors control are specifically excluded. Where the engine is a bought-out item from a different firm, the contractor frequently insists on the guaranteeddelivery programme being related to actual engine deliveries. Guarantee of performance may also have to be related to the stated performance of the bought-out engine over which the main contractor has no control. There is no simplesolution of such matters since the contract depends upon agreement between theparties, and the Ministry of Supply ought to have a wider measure of discretionthan has been obtained under the so-called &quot; commercial &quot; interpretation of the agent/ principal relationship, in negotiating the most suitable form of LiquidatedDamage Clause and guarantees of performance.(11) The General attitude of the Ministry of Supply to the question of guarantees may be summarised by saying that it is a commercial ideal whichshould be aimed at wherever possible for civil aviation but (a) aircraft firms generally, under present conditions, are not prepared to run the risks involved,(&amp;) it would not be in the national interest to force aircraft firms to adopta procedure which in the event of failure might well involvebankruptcy and lead to the liquidation of important war potential, and(c) there is a danger that the insistence on guarantees may lead to undueconservatism and timidity in aircraft design.5.   Proposals for Reform(1) In view of the serious consequences which flow from the discordantfactors inherent in the present set up, the question arises whether any worthwhileimprovement could be brought about by adjustments in procedure within thepresent organisation. It is the considered view of the Ministry of Supply thatthis is not possible; and that a satisfactory solution of the aircraft procurementproblem cam only be achieved by tackling the fundamental defect of the presentsystem with the minimum organisational disturbance necessarv for this purpose.This defect, in short, is that the development and production &quot;of civil transport aircraft are being subordinated to the desire of the three separate Corporationsto be independent trading concerns, while insufficient emphasis is placed on theneed for civil aviation to serve the national interest. The airlines must of coursestrive for efficiency and economy of operation. But civil and military aviationare still, to use the words of the Cadman Report &quot;two sides of a single coin.&quot;Civil aviation should not be regarded as a separate entity aiming at completeself-sufficiency, but as an integral part of the national aviation industry,comprising scientific and technical Establishments, designing and manufacturingfirms, and the operators. It should share to the full in the national research and development resources. Per contra, it should make the full contribution of which it is capable to the advancement of aeronautical techniques in the widestsense, and should not be inhibited from doing so by the need to adopt a narrowlycommercial outlook.
(2) This conclusion is borne out by experience in the United States as wellas in this country. The Report of President Truman&apos;s Air Policy Commission(Finletter Report) dated 30th December, 1947, recognises that in the interests ofcivil aviation itself, apart from its military potential, Government policy direction and financial assistance are necessary. The means recommended in the FinletterReport for overcoming present United States difficulties in regard to civil aircraft are similar in essence to the fundamental purposes of the British system, viz.,financial assistance to constructors in the development of civil aircraft, and tooperators in the form of Government subsidies and the provision of groundorganisation, the whole co-ordinated by Government planning and policy direction.(3) Government planning and policy direction in this country is, however, atpresent largely frustrated by the delegation of responsibility to three public corporations each acting separately in their own interests. The Ministry ofSupply is convinced that the need for far-sighted, continuous and co-ordinatedplanning of civil aircraft development and production will not be met without an organisation and procedure similar to that which obtains in the military field.The system under which military aircraft are ordered for the Services has worked well both in war and in peace and has given rise to a minimum of friction. under it the industry has produced aircraft that were proved in the supreme test of war to be the finest in the world.(4) This system is based on the fullest co-operation at all stages, from thefirst tentative formulation of a new aircraft requirement to the acceptance ofproduction deliveries, between the Service Departments and the Ministry ofSupply. Officers experienced in the problems of the user serve in those Depart-ments and are seconded as necessary to the technical departments of Ministryof Supply to the mutual benefit of all concerned. The actual stages through whicha new military aircraft passes are not fundamentally dissimilar from thosedescribed in section 3 of this memorandum, but the important points which make all the difference are these : (a) User requirements are planned by a single authority which pursues a consistent long-term policy. This authority has full control over the operators of the aircraft. For example, the aircraft requirements of fighter, Bomber, Trainer, Transport and Coastal Commands of theR.A.F. are widely different, but these are all planned and co-ordinatedby the Assistant Chief of Air Staff (Technical Requirements) in close consultation with the Controller of Supplies (Aircraft) of the Ministryof Supply and decisions taken are adhered to and effectively carriedout. Thus the perpetual conflicts and waste of resources which have occurred hitherto on the civil side are avoided.(b) The military flying services must themselves strive for efficiency and economy of operation, particularly in time of peace. But contractnegotiations for military aircraft are not hampered by the need forthe Ministry of Supply to act as an &quot; agent &quot; in a commercial sensefor the user, nor by insistence on guarantees of performance and delivery dates, with penalties for failure to achieve estimates. Thedevelopment of the best possible aircraft is regarded as the primary&apos; objective towards which all parties concerned must whole-heartedlystrive.(5) The same state of affairs will not be reached on the civil side unless one central body is created in civil aviation which can exercise the same responsibilitywith regard to the procurement of aircraft as the Air Ministry, and unless the corporations are placed in roughly the same relationship to that central bodyas the R.A.F. Commands are to the Air Ministry.(6) Such a central body would have duties analogous to those of the AirStaff. It would be responsible for forward planning and formulation to theMinistry of Supply of requirements for civil aircraft on behalf of the corporations, which would become the operating branches of the central body.(7) Such an arrangement would mean that the three Corporations would be free to concentrate on the operation of the aircraft procured on their behalf bythe central body. Experience has shown that in this field B.O.A.C. and B.E.A.Care second to none, and their record in this respect stands in marked contrast to their record in the field of forward planning, the formulation of requirements and the development of aircraft.(8) The central body would no doubt need to be staffed largely by the transferof senior members of the present Corporations&apos; technical and &quot;planning staffs,and considerable economy in man-power should thereby be obtained.   At present35609 - E
two of the three Corporations have project and development staffs of some size,which, because they go beyond what is necessary for the mere formulation ofuser&apos;s requirements, involve some duplication with those of the Ministry of Supply.The central body might also take over those functions which could more econo-mically be pooled and thus meet criticism such as that made in The Times on 6th January, 1948 : &quot; There is no reason why the three British services should continue to compete in ways reminiscent of the worst confusions of Naval and military flying before the R.A.F. was created to rationalise the rivalry of R.N.A.S.and R.F.C.....   All three work independently in matters of staff for research, medical, catering, and development duties and maintain separateDepartments for training, purchasing supplies, and other purposes that couldmore economically be pooled. This wastes skilled man-power as well as money and nothing in the inherent difficulties of the main task excuses the postpone-ment of immediate reform.&quot;(9) The Ministry of Supply proposal would also ensure the standardisation of equipment so far as possible in the interests of economy and efficiency. Atthe present time, even when two or more Corporations decide to operate the sametype of aircraft, their ideas on detailed layout and equipment are so differentthat virtually distinct types result, c.f., the Tudor I and IV, which are respectivelythe B.O.A.C. and the B.S.A.A. versions of the same aircraft; as are the Tudor and the Tudor V. In the DH. 106, B.S.A.A. have asked for a completely differentlayout of cockpit and crew stations from that adopted by B.O.A.C., and thedifference, which of course involves considerable extra expense, appears to reflectlittle more than the preferences of individual pilots. It would be the task ofthe proposed central body to make up its mind on such questions in the lightof the best technical evidence, and not expect resources to be dissipated in theproduction of alternatives unless a really sound case could be made out. thus the proposal would lead to economy and serve the interests of the airline operatorsthemselves as well as the wider national interest.(10) Representatives of the central body should work within the Ministryof Supply as do those of the Air Ministry and the Admiralty. This would ensurethat the technical advice of the Ministry of Supply is most effectively broughtto bear in the formulation of requirements, as it is on the military side, andalso that the experience of the operator is utilised to the full in the evolution of new types. The cases described in Annex II vividly illustrate the importanceof giving the technical development staff some influence in the formulation ofcivil requirements.(11) Even under the system obtaining with regard to military aircrafthowever, wide disagreement as to future requirements sometimes occurs. Forexample, the de Havilland Company proposed in 1939 that they should build anunarmed wooden aircraft, which would depend for its defence not on armamentbut on ability to fly faster and higher than its attackers. The proposal was supported by the technical side of the Air Ministry (the forerunners of theMinistry of Aircraft Production). The operational side of the Air Ministry,however, were doubtful about the efficacy of an unarmed bomber and refused toput forward a requirement for it. Nevertheless development was allowed bythe Ministry of Aircraft Production to continue and the Mosquito was lateraccepted, first as a Photographic Reconnaissance aircraft and then as an unarmedbomber, a fighter and in several mixed versions. Under a system in which nodevelopment could proceed except to meet a specific users request, this aircraft one of the most outstanding of the war would never have been built.(12) While therefore, the Ministry of Supply would normally expect toproceed in full agreement with the central procurement body for civil aviation,as with the Service Departments,aircraft research and development should remaineffectively under the unified control of the Department and should never becomeentirely dependent on the fiat of the user.(13) It may be suggested that the needs of the situation would be met if theMinistry of Civil Aviation were to become a Department more closely correspond-ing with the Air Ministry, leaving the Corporations in their present position inregard to matters other than aircraft procurement. Under the Civil AviationAct, 1946, however, the Corporations are accorded a &quot; freedom of management &quot;that the Air Ministry would never delegate to R.A.F. Commands, and, while theMinister of Civil Aviation has powers of control by Order-in-Council or direction,these would be unwieldy to exercise and he must clearly rely largely on persuasion.Moreover there is no power to direct the Corporations &quot;to operate a particular type
of aircraft. Potential sources of conflict would be far less likely to exist withina central body of which the operators would be constituent branches.(14) The Minister of Civil Aviation has recognised the need for closer co-ordination between the Corporations than exists at present in regard to the formulation of aircraft requirements, but has suggested that the problem couldbe solved by forming an &apos;&apos; Aircraft Procurement Agency in the nature of an aircraft Projects Co-ordinating body from among the- Corporations, in orderto ensure that they formulate one set of requirements for basic types for commonuse. This body would canalise the representations of the three Corporations onthe Inter-departmental Civil Aircraft Requirements Committee, and would represent them in their relationships with the Ministry of Supply and the mann-facturers .... It is implicit however that this body should be the servant ofthe Corporations and not their master.&quot; Lord Nathan has also suggested the strengthening of the I.C.A.R. Committee. The Ministry of Supply believe thatthese proposals are completely inadequate as a cure for the faults of the presentsystem; while in theory a step in the right direction with the appearance ofproviding for the co-ordinate planning of requirements, the new Agency wouldin fact probably make the situation worse by inteiposing another and mostineffective link in the chain between operator and designer. The presentCorporations have never shown themselves willing to delegate responsibility.They do not regard themselves as bound by decisions of the I.C.AJR. committee it is hardly likely that they would accept the ruling of a coordinating Committeewhich would be inferior in status to the I.C.A.R. Committee, and it would rapidlytend to degenerate into a mere forum for time-wasting discussion. While, there-fore, the Ministry of Supply fully share the view that a radical change in thepresent set-up of the three Corporations should be avoided if any other courseoffered a reasonable chance of success, they are convinced that die only sound and business-like solution is the one they have proposed, namely the creation ofa central procurement body with full and final authority in this field.(15) All the weaknesses in the present procurement system described inSection 4 would disappear if the reform suggested was carried out. Consistentand co-ordinated planning would be rendered possible in a manner most calculated to ensure that the potentialities of the present stage of aeronautical advance areexploited with vision, boldness and enterprise, and also with proper regard for economy. The nation would have better assurance of reaping full benefit fromthe  12 millions which is the share attributable to civil aviation of the total estimated expenditure next year by the Ministry of Supply of about  33 million on aeronautical research and development. The central body would own theaircraft which its operating lines would use. Relieved of the problems of day-to-day management of the airlines, the central body would be able to cultivate a wider outlook conducive to the integration of civil aircraft development with theinterests of the national aviation industry as a whole. Relations between itand the Ministry of Supply could be expected to develop on lines similar to thoseexisting between the Department and the Service Departments and consequentlyin placing production orders the Ministry of Supply would act as agents of thecentral body not in the commercial sense, but in the sense as normally understoodbetween Government Departments. In other words the Ministry of Supply wouldbe given full discretion to settle contract terms and conditions and the presentdelays caused by tripartite or ad referendum negotiations would be avoided. Amore flexible policy could also be adopted with regard to guarantees if the proeure-ment of aircraft were no longer tied to short-term commercial objectives, but were geared to a system in which the interests of British Aviation as a whole-were the first and foremost consideration.(16) To recapitulate, the Ministry of Supply is of the opinion that a satis-factory procurement system will not be reached without a reform of the existingcivil aviation organisation. It recommends the formation of a central procurementbody for the forward planning of requirements for civil aircraft, leaving thedevelopment and production of the aircraft to the Ministry of Supply and allowing the Corporations, which would become the operating branches of the central body, to concentrate on the running of airlines. This would be eeononiieal inman-power, would define clearly the responsibility of each party and would alloweach to do that for which it is best qualified. It would ensure that aircraftdevelopment was concerted within a national aviation policy instead of beingdissipated, and in the long run it would afford the Corporations the best chanceof successfully meeting world competition.\Uh March, 1948.35609
28Annex IOutline of Steps in the Evolution of Present Ordering Procedure6. Pre-war Position(1) Before 1939, it was the usual practice for the subsidised air line eom-panies to order their own aircraft direct from the manufacturers. As a resultof widespread dissatisfaction with the position of British civil aviation expressedduring the debate in the House of Commons on 24th November, 1937, a committee under the late Lord Cadman was appointed to enquire into the matters raised in the course of that debate. This Committee reported on 8th February, 1938,and recommended, inter alia, that the State should play a more active part mfostering the development of civil aircraft. The following extracts from thereport have a bearing on the question of procurement of aircraft: &quot; 16. There has been no consistent and progressive policy directed toencourage manufacturers to produce civil aircraft of types likely to secure a prominent position for the British industry in European and Dominionmarkets.&quot; The subsidies paid to Imperial Airways were not conceived with anyregard to civil aircraft construction, and the operations of that Company,wnich has viewed itself as an ordinary commercial company trading in transport, have not encouraged the development of types other than thosedesigned for its own special needs.&quot;The present demand for modern high-speed all-metal air liners of medium size has laid bare the defects of past policy. &quot;*&quot; 55. The Air Ministry should form an advisory panel comprisingrepresentatives of operators, constructors and the Ministry itself. &quot;With the collaboration of this panel and in the light of information regarding theprobable requirements, two years ahead, of aircraft in Europe and theDominions, the Air Ministry should specify broadly the requirements of alimited range of types of suitable air transport aircraft, and should ascertainwhich constructors would be interested in the production of these types.&apos;&quot; From among the interested constructors, the Air Ministry shouldselect a limited number, who would be requested to submit detailed designs,the reasonable costs of which would be reimbursed. The most suitable designfor each type would then be selected by the Air Ministry in consultation withthe panel; and account would be taken also of the manufacturing capacityof the designing firm and the price at which it would sell the aircraft. TheMinistry would undertake to bear the cost of jigs and tools necessary for theproduction of the aircraft of each design.&apos;&apos; We do not contemplate that either the panel or the selected constructorsshould necessarily be restricted to the Air Ministry&apos;s list of &apos; Approved 1firms.&quot; 56. In order that the prototypes should be thoroughly tested before being put into production, the subsidised operating companies should, with due regard to their business, be required to test them under normal conditionsof service. In.addition to enabling final improvements to be made, thesetests would demonstrate the products of the British construction industryin places overseas. When machines representing a definite advance in operating technique had thus been produced and shown, the sales organisa-tions of the constructing companies would doubtless do their part bv securing;orders for them.*&quot;; 57. In the event of the aircraft being commercially successful, theState should obviously be entitled to recover the whole or part of itscon-tribution to design and manufacture. We suggest, therefore, that in this event a proportion of the sums paid should be refunded by the constructorin respect of each aircraft sold in excess of a predetermined number.* Note.-According to the S.B.A.C. Memorandum on &quot;The Future of British Air Transport,&quot; 1943, &quot; not one all-metal aircraft designed and built for Imperial Airways wasever sold to another operator.   In fact, some Imperial Airways&apos; contracts for aircraftincluded a clause which forbade the constructor to offer the aircraft elsewhere_andthis at a time when American aircraft companies, stimulated by a competitive virileand rapxdly expanding domestic airline system, were able as a result to offer to&apos; airlineoperators all over the world efficient, stressed-skin, all-metal aeroplanes &quot;
&quot; 58. The State assistance to the construction industry, which we havesuggested in the previous paragraphs, should be a reasonable supplement to commercial enterprise, and should enable aircraft of an advanced designto be offered at prices competitive with those of foreign makes.&quot; 59. Although the foregoing procedure applies particularly to thestimulation of British aircraft construction to meet present requirements, weconsider that the necessity for timely development Of future types mustcontinuously be borne in mind, and it may well be essential to continue, forsome time to come, the State assistance we have recommended.&apos;&apos; 60. The restoration of British prestige in civil aviation and the promotion of the aircraft industry are among the prime reasons forsubsidising air services in Europe. We consider that, to assist indemonstrating in that area the quality of up-to-date British products, special grants should be made, where necessary, to the operating companies, to enablethem to replace their fleet with new aircraft before its normal obsolescenceperiod has expired.&quot; 61. The replacement of the large aircraft designed especially forthe main overseas services and long-distance routes presents a similarproblem. It is essential to formulate a specific programme of development for these aircraft, which will ensure that the operating companies are at all times using aircraft that are in the van of aeronautical progress. This will,in particular, secure progressive development of large-type flying boats.&apos;1(2) Thus, the Cadman Committee recognised that the development of new types of civil aircraft calls for long-term planning in which the State must play an active part. In fact, since the cost of development has frequently to be borneby the taxpayer, that part must be a controlling one. The Government, in their observations on the Report, pointed out that the Air Ministry were in fact carry-ing out a long-range development programme on the lines contemplated by theCommittee and that, in addition, the Air Ministry by their subsidy policy hadstood behind the development of such types as the Short Empire flying boat.The Government added that this dual policy .of direct development expenditure and of encouragement through subsidised companies would be steadily pursued infuture years. Acting on the recommendation of the Committee that they should play a more active part in fostering the development of civil aircraft, the Govern-ment created, in the Air Ministry, the post of Director of Civil Research and production and the Air Estimates for 1939 provided the sum of half a millionpounds for expenditure on the development of new civil types, which, but for thewar, would no doubt have been operated on the subsidised national air lines. Inone case, viz., the Fairey 15/38, not only prototypes but also production aircraft for use by one of those air lines were, in fact, ordered by the Air Ministry. Thefirst definite steps in the direction of a system of Government ordering were thustaken as the outcome of the recommendations of an independent Committee ofEnquiry.(3) Later the Government introduced a Bill providing that for the purposeof developing overseas services, the two subsidised companies Imperial Airwaysand British Airways should be amalgamated into a single public Corporation.In moving the second reading of this Bill (The British Overseas Airways Bill),in July 1939, the Secretary of State for Air (Sir Kingsley Wood) stated that oneof the main objects of the proposal was to secure the development of a far-sightedlong-range policy in British aircraft production. There were also, he said, great advantages in the unification of the two companies, such as the pooling of experience, equipment, ground organisation and technical resources. Much couldbe accomplished by the centralised control of-the fleet, the training of personnel and the concentration of management and forward planning. France, Holland,Germany, Belgium and Switzerland had already adopted the policy of concen-tration of State aid on a single company so far as their overseas services were concerned, relying mainly on international competition to provide the necessarystimulus for progress and efficiency. Sir Kingsley Wood also announced that hehad decided to set up a high level Civil Aviation Development Committee, themain functions of which would be to co-ordinate the needs of air line operatorsfor new-type aeroplanes, so that consideration could be concentrated upon a relatively few types for which there would be a good prospect of finding a sufficientmarket to justify production on an adequate scale. The needs of the new corporation as well as of other operators would be related by this Committee tothe demands of the world market.   The Under-Secretary of State for Air
(Captain Balfour) later explained that aircraft would be ordered and paid forby the Corporation, but the capital expenditure would have to be sanctioned bythe Secretary of State for Air and obviously he would sanction it only after due regard had been paid to the findings of the Civil. Aviation development committee.(4) The Government of the day thus expressed its conviction of the need forState planning in the field of civil&quot;aircraft development, and indicated its inten-tion to exercise some control over the British Overseas Airways Corporation inregard to the purchase of aircraft, in order to avoid a repetition of what had occurred when Imperial Airways dealt freely with the manufacturers.7. The War, 1939-45(1) In 1940 the aircraft research, development, production and contractsdepartments of the Air Ministry became part of the new Ministry of aircraft production. Work on civil aircraft had ceased entirely on the outbreak of warbut, in 1943, the Brabazon Committee was appointed to advise on the design and production of civil aircraft and to prepare outline specifications of the types thatwould be needed for post-war transport. The constitution of the Committee was similar to that contemplated by Sir Kingsley Wood in July, 1939, for his proposedCivil Aviation Development Committee and included representatives of the air-craft industry and the operators. It seemed even- more essential in 1943 than in1939 that the Government should exercise a controlling influence, not only becauseof the overriding demands of the war effort, but also in the interests of civilaviation itself. The post-war organisation of civil air transport had not beendecided upon, so that there were no operators in a position to place orders for aircraft. Quite apart from this, however, at a time when resources were strainedto the utmost and Service demands were paramount, orders for the types reconi-mended by the Brabazon Committee could only be placed by the Ministry of aircraft Production, since that Department controlled and allocated the priorityand distribution of all calls upon the resources of the aircraft industry. orders were, therefore, placed by the Ministry of Aircraft Production in anticipation ofthe needs of operators, including in &quot;certain cases (e.g., the Tudor I and Tudor II)production aircraft to the numbers estimated, by the Air Ministry&apos;s Departmentof Civil Aviation, as the likely post-war requirements.8. Setting up of the Ministry of Civil Aviation(1) In 1945 the Ministry of Civil Aviation Act was passed, Clause 1 of which reads as follows : &quot; It shall be lawful for His Majesty to appoint a Minister of CivilAviation (in this Act referred to as the Minister) who shall be charged withthe general duty of organising, cariwing out and encouraging measures forthe development of civil aviation, for the design, development and productionof civil aircraft, for the promotion of safety and efficiency in the use thereof,for research into questions relating to air navigation:&quot; Provided that this sub-section shall not authorise the production of civil aircraft by the Minister.&quot;(2) The above was, in effect, a statutory declaration of the Government^responsibility in regard to the development and production of civil aircraft. Thefact that it was formally allocated to the Minister of Civil Aviation seems to havebeen due to the uncertainty which existed at that time as to what the machinery would be for the exercise in peacetime of the functions carried out during thewar by the Ministry of Aircraft production. Sir Stafford Cripps (then Ministerof Aircraft Production) during the debate on the Ministry of Civil Aviation Billin the House of Commons on 11th April, 1945, said : -&quot;So long as my Department remains in existence, and that, I imagine,will anyhow be until the end of the war, it is the intention that I shouldbe responsible for the design, development and production of civil aircraft,in accordance with the requirements put forward by the Ministry of CivilAviation. It will be the task of that Ministry to look after the interests ofthe operators, and to co-ordinate their needs. During such time as circum-stances render it necessary, as they do at present, for the Government toplace orders for civil aircraft, such orders will be given by my Ministry onbehalf of the Ministry of Civil Aviation.&quot;
(9) Policy of the Labour Government(1) When the present Government was formed, the Ministry of Supply andthe Ministry of Aircraft Production were put under the charge of one Minister,and on 29th October, 1945, the Prime Minister announced that the intention wasto amalgamate the two Departments as soon as practicable. The priaaary dutyof the combined Ministry would be the furnishing of supplies and the carryingout of research, design and development, for the Fighting Services. This duty would be carried out in close collaboration with the Service Departments in orderto ensure that the &quot; user &quot; interests were given proper weight. The combinedMinistry would also be responsible for the supply, and, in many eases, the design,of a large range of stores used by the Government for which concentration ofof purchasing arrangements seemed advantageous, and would retain the fiine-tions hitherto exercised by the Ministry of Aircraft Production on behalf of theMinistry of Civil Aviation. In reply to a question, the Prime Minister added thatthere was no question of a Government Department standing in the way or directassociation between the users of civil aircraft and the manufactures. It was theGovernments intention all through that the users and producers should be in close contact, and this in fact has been the policy followed by the Ministry of Supply.(2) The Government&apos;s plan for the operation of British Air services wereoutlined in a White Paper presented to Parliament by the Minister of CivilAviation in December 1945 (Cmd. 6712). The services were to be placed under national ownership and control. It was stated that the number of air transport undertakings ultimately desirable in the national interest could be decided onlyin the light of experience, but initially the Government proposed to establish threestatutory Corporations with separate spheres of responsibility. Each would be given direct assistance from the Exchequer if necessary. Subject to the require-ments of general policy, the Corporations were to have the maximum freedom inthe operation and management of air services assigned to them.(3) The Government case for having three separate Corporations was givenin debates in the House of Commons as being the desirability of trying out differentideas about operating techniques, of developing a spirit of emulation, of gatheringa varied experience and of having some measure of competition. The conception of a single exclusive Corporation was criticised by Government spokesmen asinvolving a danger that one man at the top might impose his ideas throughoutthe organisation, to the exclusion from civil aviation of men with dissenting views,and as involving a less intimate supervision by headquarters over the organisation as a whole. Centralised arrangements were promised for services which could best be run centrally and common functions would not be triplicated. If futureexperience showed that three Corporations were too many or too few, modificationscould be made.(4) The White Paper of December 1945 (Cmd. 6712) said that it would bethe general policy of the Government to require the Corporations to use british aircraft types, but did not specify in detail the method by which they were to beprocured. The following paragraphs, however, recognised the importance of collaboration between all parties in the development of new types: &quot;Research and Development, and Design of Aircraft. Air line operation depends for its advancement on technical progress, for success or failureis more dependent on the type of equipment used than on any other factor.Creative research and development, therefore, is indispensable to advancementin an industry of which technical progress is the life blood. An air line,equipped with outmoded aircraft, no matter how efficiently its operations and business are conducted, will soon be outdistanced by another using aircraft of superior and more economical performance. The fullest emphasis will therefore be laid on research and development connected with air lime opera-tion. It is not proposed to set up a separate research department for CivilAviation, but Civil Aviation is receiving equal status with other claimantsin aeronautical research fostered by the State. Arrangements have alreadybeen made for representatives of the Ministry of Civil Aviation to join onan equal footing with representatives of the Services in the M.A-P. Com-mittees which determine the allocation of design resources and the priority of development projects.&quot;The characteristics required in civil aircraft can best be discovered orproved by experience in operation. There must therefore be collaboration between user, designer and producer of the aircraft. Arrangements havebeen made to ensure close and continuing collaboration between the air transport corporations, the aircraft producers and the responsible Government
Department. These arrangements will ensure that every facility is providedfor the individual corporations to obtain aircraft incorporating the featuresthey consider necessary to successful operation of their air services.&quot;(5) On 24th January, 1946, the Government decided that orders for aircraftrequired by the three corporations should continue to be placed by the Ministryof Aircraft Production, which was then on the point of being merged into apermanent Ministry of Supply (as announced by the Prime Minister on 29thOctober, 1945) with functions including the ordering of aircraft for all Govern-ment users. This decision was announced in the House of Commons by the lord president of the Council on the same day.10. Establishment of Machinery for Planning of Civil Aircraft Requirements(1) After the formation of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, it was assumed that the functions hitherto performed by the Brabazon Committee in preparingoutline specifications of new civil types, would be taken over by the new Ministry,and that, in this respect, the Ministry of. Civil Aviation would be in the same position as the other main customers of the Ministry of Supply for aircraft (theAir Ministry and the Admiralty). In practice, however, it soon became clear thatthe control which the new Ministry would exercise over the operating corporations in regard to the planning of aircraft requirements was very small. There arose adisquieting tendency on the part of operators to change their minds frequently asto future requirements and to reserve their position with regard to the acceptanceof types already on order. It was evident by the Spring of 1946 that in viewof the length of time required for the development of new types (at least five years for large transport aircraft), some more effective planning machinery must be devised if we were ever to catch up the leeway lost as a result of our concentration on military aircraft during the war. The Ministers of Civil Aviation and ofSupply therefore decided to take the following action : (i) To order that all projects already started should be pushed ahead with themaximum speed without any fundamental changes in conception andwith the minimum number of modifications consistent with therequirements of safety and efficient operation.(ii) To set up a Committee consisting of the following members : Sir Henry Self,  Permanent Secretary, Ministry of  CivilAviation (Chairman).Air  Vice-Marshal   Collier,   Director-General  of   TechnicalServices, Ministry of Civil Aviation.Mr. Walmsley, Director of Aircraft Requirements, Ministry ofCivil Aviation.Lord Knollys, Chairman, B.O.A.C.Air Vice-Marshal Bennett, Chief Executive, B.S.A.A.Mr. d&apos;Erlanger, Managing Director, B.E.A.Mr. Musgrave, Under-Secretary (Air), Ministry of Supply.Mr. Scott-Hall, Principal Director of Technical Development(Air), Ministry of Supplywith the following terms of reference : (a) To review the present programme of design and construction of civil aircraft and the progress achieved to date.(6) To compare the position with that obtaining in other countries, notably in the United States and to prepare recommendations on the types ofcivil aircraft that should be developed in readiness for future use.(c) To prepare statements of civil aircraft requirements together with a forecast giving the approximate number of each type of aircraft likelyto be required.(2) The first meeting of this Committee, which is called the InterdepartmentalCivil Aircraft Requirements Committee, took place on 27th May, 1946, and todate it has held seventeen meetings in all. A representative of the Treasury wasadded to the Committee in September 1946. On 23rd July, 1946, the committee presented a first Interim Report to the Ministers of Supply and of Civil Aviationwhich was circulated to the Cabinet on 2nd August, 1946 (Annex B to cp. (46) 317). The Report consisted of a review of the existing programmes and contained recommendations with regard to production orders for types then underdevelopment.   Tt was stated that m a later report the Committee intended to
submit recommendations for new aircraft on which planning should be startedwithout delay to succeed the Brabazon types. No such report has in fact beenmade, however, and the only new type which has emerged so far from the delibera-tions of the committee is a medium range (Empire) type of conventional designasked for by B.O.A.C. While the committee is useful as a forum for discussion,it has not been successful as a means of securing the agreement of all concerned on a long-term programme of future civil aircraft requirements.  .11. Changes in Procedure for Placing Production Orders(1) The experience of the Air Ministry and the Ministry of aircraft production tends to show that.the most satisfactory and economical method of developing a new type of aircraft is to build prototypes first and to defer quantityproduction until the specification can be defined in some detail, thus avoiding theneed for extensive modifications on the production line. During the period of re-armament preceding the outbreak of war, however, the re-equipment of the AirForce with up-to-date types became so urgent that it was necessary to take thegamble of going into production &quot; off the drawing board,&quot; i.e., before prototypeshad been built and tested. If the gamble came off, the type went into serviceearlier, but if not, time and money was wasted in building production aircraft which later had to be extensively altered.(2) It was decided to follow the normal practice of development on prototypesin the case of the requirements laid down by the Brabazon Committee for newcivil types, but, in view of the need to provide interim aircraft quickly for theimmediate post-war period, types such as the Tudor I and Tudor II were orderedin quantity &quot; off the drawing board.&quot; In these contracts the Ministry of aircraft production, following their practice in the case of military types, includedspecifications (in full agreement with the operators) Avhich were in the nature ofa target representing what it was thought could reasonably be achieved at that stage of aeronautical progress. Provision was, however, made for modifications asthe work proceeded so that, in effect, the manufacturer could not be strictly held to the original specification nor was there any guarantee against delay in delivery of satisfactory aircraft. This type of contract, although it may appear lenient tothe manufacturer, is in fact, a practical recognition that the process of develop-ment of a new type is one in which the user and the State-controlled research anddevelopment organisations must fully co-operate with the designer andmanufacturer; and many outstanding types of military aircraft have been produced under contracts of this kind.(3) Soon after the end of the war, however, it became apparent that this form of contract would not be suitable for the ordering of civil production aircraft to be operated on a commercial basis. The B.O.A.C. representatives on theI.C.A.R. Committee advocated contracts at fixed prices incorporating guaranteeson the part of the manufacturer as to performance and delivery date with a sliding scale of penalties for failure to achieve estimates. Such contracts were held to bein accordance with current American commercial practice and also with thatfollowed by Imperial Airways before the war. In the Interim Report of theI.C.A.R. Committee dated 23rd July, 1946, it was recommended that when futureproduction orders for civil aircraft were placed &quot; guarantees should, so far asmay be just and practicable, be obtained from the manufacturers of airframesand engines as to performance, delivery dates and prices; with a sliding scale ofpenalties for failure to achieve estimates.&quot;(4) If a manufacturer is prepared to enter into a fully guaranteed productioncontract at the outset it becomes unnecessary to order prototypes at all since the risks and costs of development are shouldered by the firm. Cases wereenvisaged, however, where firms would not be prepared to give such guaranteeswithout prototype experience, and it would then frequently be necessary forprototypes to be ordered first. At a meeting held by the Ministry of Supply withrepresentatives of M.C.A., the Treasury and the Corporations on 26th August,1946, to discuss the problems involved, the opportunity was taken of discussing the desire frequently expressed by the Corporations to place their orders direct with manufacturers and not through the Ministry. The opinions expressed bythe Corporations differed widely. B.S.A.A. claimed complete freedom, holdingthat it should the user&apos;s responsibility to state his requirements to the aircraft firmdirect, and that the design of the aircraft to meet those requirements and toobtain a Certificate of Airworthiness should be entirely the responsibility of the firm, which would seek the assistance of Government Establishments such asR.A.E. if it wished to do so. At the other extreme, B.E.A. appreciated the value35609 F
of Ministry of Supply participation in the development process and stated that,although in principle they would like to place their own production contracts, theywere not yet ready to do so and would need assistance from Ministry of supply in drawing up specifications and contract documents. B.O.A.C. took up an intermediate position.(5) On 11th September, 1946, the Prime Minister issued a Directive laying down that the procedure for ordering civil aircraft for the Corporations should infuture be based on the following principles : &quot;(a) Contracts for these aircraft should include guarantees by the manufacturers as to performance and delivery dates and provisionfor penalties if these guarantees are not fulfilled.&quot; (&amp;) While the orders should continue to be placed by the Ministry of Supplyand not by the Corporations themselves, in order to secure theadvantages of bulk purchase and to co-ordinate military and civilproduction, the Ministry should place these orders as agents of, andin agreement with, the Corporations, who should carry the financial risks appropriate to the purchaser.&quot;The Ministries of Supply and of Cival Aviation were consulted as to the wording of this Directive, but not the Corporations.12. Failure of Eforts to Reach Agreement with M.C.A. and the Corporations onOrdering Procedure(1) To facilitate the discharge of Ministry of Supply responsibilities forcarrying out research, development and production on behalf of other depart-ments, a Supply Council was formed under the chairmanship of the Minister,with high level representation from the Service Departments and the Ministry ofCivil Aviation. At a meeting on 4th February, 1947, this Council considered thegeneral procedure for ordering civil aircraft, and, in particular, the followingpropositions : (a) That the technical Directorates of the Ministry of Supply should playthat role in the development of new types of civil aircraft which ithas become traditional for them to play in the development of military aircraft and that there should be no reversion to the state of affairs which existed before the appointment of the Cadman Committee (seeparagraph 6 (1) above;(b) that orders for development and production of aircraft required by thethree Corporations should continue to be placed by the Ministry ofSupply.(2) The representatives of the Air Ministry and the Admiralty expressedentire agreement with those propositions. If the Corporations were allowed to contract out, all departments would lose the advantages of the present system.Sir Henry Self (Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation) was also almostentirely in agreement with these views but pointed out that the Corporations wererestive. He believed that they would accept the present position up to the point when programmes had been agreed by the Inter-Departmental Civil aircraft requirements Committee, but when the programmes had been agreed and fitted in with the other requirements on the aircraft industry he thought they would wish toassume responsibility for the actual placing of the contracts. He did not subscribe to the doctrine that a Government Department could buy more cheaply than acommercial organisation. He suggested that if the development of civil aircraft were left to the Ministry of Supply and any priority issues between the corporations and the Service Departments were established before production orders were placed, there might be no objection to changing the procedure to theextent of leaving production orders to be placed by the Corporations. The Councildecided that a joint Ministry of Supply/M.C.A. Committee should be set up toexamine this suggestion and, if it were practicable, to work out a scheme tosafeguard the position of the other departments.(3) This committee, of which the chairman was Mr. F. C. Musgrave, Under-Secretary (Air), Ministry of Supply, reported on 13th May, 1947. In effect, its recommendations amounted to the conclusion that the arrangement proposed bySir Henry Self was practicable, subject to certain conditions, the most important of which were : (a) Production orders for a new type should not normally be placed until after the design had been stabilised.(6) The timing of production orders should be decided by the I.C.A.R.Committee.
(c) The question whether Ministry of Supply or the Corporation concerned should place the production order would depend on the extent of the design work remaining to be done and of the Ministry of Supplyinterest in it.The Report concluded with the following words : &apos;&apos; While we believe that our recommendations represent the best recon-ciliation of the position, on the one hand of the Corporations under the CivilAviation Act, 1946, and on the other hand of the Ministry of Supply, weshould like to point out that they involve a considerable amount of consulta-tion between the Corporation and the Ministry of Supply, and to emphasise that the proposed procedure is unlikely to work smoothly and satisfactorilyunless both sides show the greatest willingness to co-operate. In particular it is of the greatest importance that the Corporation should realise that their position under the Civil Aviation Act requires them to be aware that widernational interests than their own are at stake in the field of aircraft design and manufacture, and that there are questions in this field which the Depart-ments concerned must be the arbiters. We believe that, with the mutual understanding and &apos;&apos; agreement to agree &apos;&apos; which are normal between theMinistry of Supply and the Services, just and amicable settlement of any differences can be achieved, and that it is more than ever necessaiy at thepresent time for Government Departments, industry and consumers to work together as a team in the national interest.&quot;(4) At Sir Henry Selfs request the Committee had not taken evidence fromrepresentatives of the Corporations; nor had they sought the views of the aircraft industry. In June 1947, however, the President and the Director of the society of British Aircraft Constructors intimated to the Ministry of Supply that theSociety had been debating the question and that, while there was not completeunanimity in their ranks, a large majority considered that in the interests of allconcerned orders should be placed by the Ministry. The minority (believed to consist, though the S.B.A.C. did not say so, of the one firm of de Havillands)wished to have a closer contact with the Corporations. Even this minority,however, recognised that an extremely difficult financial problem would have to be solved if the Corporations ordered their aircraft direct, viz., the question as to how development costs would be borne.(5) With one important exception, the recommendations of the MusgraveCommittee were acceptable to the two Ministries. The Ministry of Supply,supported by the two Service Ministries, was not prepared to delegate to theI.C.A.R. Committee see (b) of paragraph 12 (3) responsibility for decidingwhen the development of an aircraft had reached the stage at which a productionorder could be placed. The Corporations contended that they should be thearbiters on this matter and at a further meeting which Sir Henry Self had withthem on 30th July, 1947, it was clear that there was no prospect of persuadingthem to agree to a solution on the lines even of the Committee&apos;s report, much lesswith the reservation required by the Ministry of Supply. Thus the deadlockcontinued.(6) On 11th December, 1947, the Report of the Courtney Committee on the tudor I was presented and this led the Cabinet to call for a re-examination of relations with the Corporations. In response, the Minister of Supply put forward proposals for the solution of the problem by the creation of a central body whichwould be responsible for procuring, through the Ministry of Supply, all aircraftrequired for the operation of the Corporations&apos; services. The Minister of CivilAviation expressed strong disagreement with these proposals and suggested as analternative, the formation of an &quot; Aircraft Procurement Agency in the natureof an Aircraft Projects Co-ordinating body from among the Corporations,&quot;which should, however, &quot; be their servant and not their master.&quot; At the meetingof the Socialisation of Industries Committee on 16th January, 1948, it was agreedthat a small number of independent advisers should be taken into consultationbefore the Government decided its future course of action.35609
Annex IIChanges of the Corporations&apos; Aircraft Requirements13. Many examples could be given to show how civil aircraft planning anddevelopment has been jeopardised by changes on the part of the Corporations intheir requirements of aircraft and reversals of previous decisions. The InterimReport of the Courtney Committee dealing with the Tudor I contains evidence on this point.   The following is a selection (not a complete list) of other examples.14.   Marathon(1) The Marathon was one of the types recommended by the Second BrabazonCommittee, and an order for three prototypes was placed with Miles AircraftLimited by the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Although there was no definite demand or requirement from any of the Operators, the M.A.P. continued with the development of these prototypes and the first flight took place in May1946. Many efforts were made to interest the Operators in the type, but without success until June 1946, when the B.E.A.C. at the I.C.A.R. Committee agreed that25 of the turbine-engined version of the aircraft (Marathon II) should be orderedfor them. In order to enable this aircraft to be produced and with a view to export sales, the Ministry of Supply at the same time ordered, by means of anunder-writing arrangement with the firm, a further 25 of the piston-enginedversion (Marathon I).(2) In April 1947, however, B.E.A.C. changed their minds, and decided thatthe Marathon I was better suited to their purpose. They asked for the order to be amended accordingly. The Ministry of Supply have continued with one prototypeof the turbine-engined version.(3) More recently, B.E.A.C have expressed doubts as to the suitability of theaircraft for many of their routes and have suggested a reduction in the quantityrequired, and at the same time are asking for an improved performance from theaircraft.15. ViscountTwo prototypes were ordered in March 1946, largely as a result of advice bythe Ministry of Supply as to the potentialities of propeller turbine engines in civil aircraft. B.E.A.C. agreed that this aircraft seemed suitable for their routes,and it was decided that it should be developed specially for these duties. the closest liaison with Vickers Armstrong (Limited) was accordingly maintained bythe B.E.A.C. through 1946 and 1947. The I.C.A.R. Committee in July 1946recommended that a production order for 75 aircraft should be placed on behalfof B.E.A.C. and this was approved in principle by the Prime Minister in Sep-tember. The firm commenced to plan their production programme on this basis.In December 1947, the B.E.A.C., after seeing the Ambassador demonstrated inthe air, decided not to proceed with the Viscount, but to adopt the Ambassadorinstead. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Supply contemplate continuing with thedevelopment of the Viscount, in order that the advantages of turbine-enginedaircraft can be realised as quickly as possible for the benefit of civil aviation.16. Ambassador(1) The Ambassador was first ordered by M.A.P. (two prototypes) in January1944, as a result of discussions at the Second Brabazon Committee, on which the operators were represented. Many unavailing efforts were made during 1945,1946 and 1947, by Ministry of Supply to interest the Corporations in this aircraft.(2) At a meeting held in February 1945, between the Minister of CivilAviation (Lord Swinton) and the Minister of Aircraft Production (Sir stafford cripps), together with representatives of the Operators, the suitability of the ambassador as against a smaller D.C.3 replacement, was discussed. Thefollowing is an extract from the minutes : -&quot; The Minister of Aircraft Production recalled that A.S.57(Ambassador) had been initiated on the recommendation of the BrabazonCommittee, who had reached their conclusion on the basis of the best evidence and advice available at the time. It now appeared that the A.S.57 wasnot the ideal type for European services, but owing to lack of design capacitythe ideal type could not be started for some time. The question was, would the operators use the A.S.57 when completed, even if it was not their ideal,or would they prefer not to use it at all?&quot;The result of the meeting was to confirm that there was no demand for the ambassador, the Operators pressing for a &quot; D.C.3 replacement&quot; instead.
(3) Further efforts were made during 1946 and 1947, at meetings of theI.C.A.R. Committee and its Working Parties, to establish some requirement forthis aircraft, but with no success. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Supply continued the development, partly encouraged by the prospect at that time of production orders for a military transport version for the R.A.F. and partly by the factthat some operators said they would be interested in a later propeller turbineversion. The first Ambassador prototype flew in July 1947 and was demonstratedat the S.B.A.C. display in September. In December 1947, the B.E.A.C. decidedthat it was, after all, the type best suited for their principal routes.17. HermesPrototypes were first ordered in August 1943, with the full support of theB.O.A.C. They progressed this type continually until the Tudor II came intothe picture in October 1944, whereupon they transferred their interest to the tudor II. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Supply proceeded with the type andin November 1946, the I.C.A.B. Committee agreed to orders being placed onbehalf of B.O.A.C. for twenty-five Hermes IV, a later development of the firstprototype Hermes. The Ministry of Supply preferred the Hermes V, a versionwith propeller turbine engines, and in spite of lack of interest from the corporations, ordered two prototypes of this aircraft. The development of theHermes V has been proceeding, and there are now indications that B.O.A.C.have some interest in it.18. MR. (E)The only example during the last three years of an aircraft. of which the requirement originated with a Corporation, is the medium-range Empire type(M.R. (E)). B.O.A.C. produced a statement of their requirements in broad outline at an I.C.A.R. Committee meeting in November 1946 and followed it with further detailed requirements in January 1947. These were criticised bythe Ministry of Supply as being little in advance of results already obtainedfrom the American Constellation but were nevertheless put out to tender, andin August 1947 B.O.A.C. chose the Bristol design. No immediate order wasthen placed, however, as the B.O.A.C. stiffened their requirements, and prolongednegotiations with Bristols have been necessary, which are still continuing.19. Long-Range TypeB.O.A.C. have been content to rely entirely on the successful developmentof the D.H. 106 for their long-range services, apart from a lukewarm interestin the Brabazon I and Saunders Roe 10/46. They pressed for orders to beplaced for the D.H. 106 long before it had crystallised in the minds of theconstructors in its present form. The type, however, is highly experimentalin many respects, having to fly very much faster and very much higher than any present civil aircraft, and its success requires the satisfactory solution of several major engineering problems. Some insurance against failure or delaywith the type seemed essential to the Ministry of Supply, and in July 1947the Department, in consultation with M.C.A., put forward proposals for an aircraft suitable for the longer range routes, which did not involve the problemsof flight at very high speeds and altitudes, and which might be a means of utilising the Napier compound engine with its promise of great savings in fuel consumption.The Corporation were again lukewarm over this proposal, but the Ministry ofSupply decided to invite design studies from several firms. These have just beenreceived and there are signs of a more general awakening of interest in the type.(ii) MINISTRY OF CIVIL AVIATIONIntroductory1. There is agreement between the Ministry of Supply, Ministry of CivilAviation and the Airways Corporations that the existing procedure for the procurement of aircraft for the Corporations is unsatisfactory, but a wide diver-gence of views exists between Ministry of Supply, on the one hand, and Ministryof Civil Aviation and the Corporations, on the other, on the necessary remedyor remedies.
2. Stated in its simplest terms, the main problem is to reconcile the financial responsibility of the Government for aircraft development projects and forthe overall control of the aircraft manufacturing industry with the paramountneed to establish the usual direct contractual relationship between the manufac-turer and the Air Corporations, as users, for the procurement of their aircraft requirements.3. As an approach to the solution of these problems,, the various aspectsare examined under the following heads : A. Basic factors which govern the position.B. Existing procedure for procurement of aircraft and its main defects.C. Arguments adduced in defence of Ministry of Supply ordering andcommentary on the validity of these arguments.D. Proposals for future ordering of aircraft in consonance with the basicfactors which govern the position.A. Basic Factors which Govern the Position4. Any arrangements made for meeting the aircraft requirements of the corporations must have regard to the following considerations : (a) The Minister of Civil Aviation, under the Ministry of Civil AviationAct, 1945, is responsible for fostering the development of civil aviation,including the design and production of civil aircraft (Annex). Heis also responsible, under the Civil Aviation Act, 1946, for the policyof development of air transport services, through the three air corporations as executive instruments. The programmes of theirplanned activities (including aircraft procurement proposals) and their detailed Annual Estimates, on which subsidy assistance is based,require his statutory approval. He is also responsible for the provisionof the aerodromes into and from which the aircraft must be capableof operating.(&amp;) The Government, through the Minister of Civil Aviation and the Corpora-tions, aims at securing safe and efficient air transport services, as nearly as possible on a self-supporting basis, in a highly competitiveinternational field.(c) The aircraft in service are the largest single factor in determiningefficient and economical working of airline operations.(d) The Corporations are required to fly British aircraft (except on the north atlantic) and, unlike their foreign competitors, are not free to selecttheir aircraft from other available markets.(e) Only the airline operator can specify the commercial requirements (pay-load, range, maintenance characteristics and the internal layout) ofthe aircraft to be built. He will be judged by the results in termsof safety, regularity and financial out-turn.(/) Because the design and construction of large aircraft take a considerable time the operator must plan his aircraft requirements for some years ahead. These requirements must be planned in relation to the routes to be operated, the facilities available along these routes, estimates oftraffic, the authorised programme of capital expenditure and what it is technically possible for the aircraft manufacturing industry toproduce. A statement of these specifications requires imaginationand foresight on the part of the operator, linked with information about Government policy and the potentialities of the aircraft manu-facturing industry. The operator must, therefore, work in close touchwith the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Ministry of Supply. the interdepartmental Civil Aircraft Requirements Committee, generally known as the Self Committee (consisting of representatives of theMinistry of Civil Aviation, the Ministry of Supply, the Treasury andthe three Corporations) was set up to fulfil this essential purpose.(g) At the present stage of aeronautical research the development ofpromising designs involves (i) substantial expenditure which is beyondthe means of an airline operator or an aircraft manufacturer andwhich must fall on Government, and (ii) the assistance of Governmentaeronautical establishments. This means the closest consultation withthe Ministry of Supply because of its responsibility for aircraftdevelopment and because it has, in any event, to co-ordinate civil and military requirements.
(h) In order to secure a proper sense of responsibility for development workundertaken on his behalf, the airline operator should from the outsetbe linked with the development of a design intended to meet hisrequirements and should incur a financial responsibility at the orderingstage.B. Existing procedure for procurement of aircraft and its main defects5. The existing procedure is outlined in a statement furnished by theMinistry of Supply (Appendix B (i)). Paragraphs 4 (8) and 5 of that statementdescribe the nature of the contractual provisions relating to compliance withperformance specifications and prescribed delivery dates, fixed prices andassociated penalties for failure This procedure follows the principles laid downin the Prime Ministers instruction of 11th September, 1946, to whichparagraph 3 of the Ministry of Supply Statement refers. It should be explained,however, that only one contract which entirely fulfils these requirements has yetbeen placed, namely, the order for the de Havilland Comet, D.H. 106. Attemptsare being made to negotiate a similar contract with Bristols for a .new typemedium range aircraft for the Empire routes (M.R.E. or Bristol 175). If these negotiations are successful, this contract and the D.H. 106 contract will be thefirst Ministry of Supply contracts to include precise provisions relating to theterms of a normal commercial contract, e.g., delivery dates, fixed prices and, maybe, consequential penalties for non-fulfilment. Nor, according to the Ministry ofSupply, is there any assurance that the general body of manufacturers will be willing to accept these all-important conditions in their future contracts with theMinistry of Supply. The more usual form of contract, covering the main bodyof existing orders, includes no provision for penalties for failure to meet definitedelivery dates or for agreed fixed prices.6.   The main defects of the present system may be shortly summarised as : (i) The unsatisfactory nature of the generality of contracts placed by theMinistry of Supply,(ii) The absence of the usual direct contractual relationship between the corporations (as users) and the manufacturers (as suppliers).7. As stated in paragraph 5 above, the generality of Ministry of Supplycontracts includes no provision for fixed prices nor for penalties for failure tomeet performance specifications and delivery dates. Such contracts are altogethertoo speculative as a basis of procurement of aircraft for commercial exploitation,even though they may prove acceptable for military types. It is not difficult tovisualise the effect on the Corporations&apos; plans and on their prospects ofcommercial success if an aircraft designed to operate on a given route fails to fulfil the requisite specification or if delivery and, hence, planned entry into service is so belated that it is already outmoded by foreign, or even Dominion,competitors. The effect on the Corporations&apos; budgets and trading relations oflack of firm prices is dealt with in more detail in paragraph 16 below.8. The difficulties and consequences attendant on the type of contractmentioned in the preceding paragraph are exemplified in acute form in the InterimReport of the (Courtney) Committee of Enquiry into the Tudor Aircraft (Cmd.7307). A clear indication of the views of that Committee on the unsatisfactorynature of the existing ordering procedure is given in the following paragraph,reproduced from the Report.&quot; 89. The fact that B.O.A.C. were not themselves the buyers of theaircraft also played its part in causing delay. On the one hand they werenot subj ect to the restraining consideration that the cost, direct and indirect,of every modification was to fall on them: on the other, A. V. Roe Ltd., couldnot be certain how far they had to do what B.O.A.C. asked if they felt thattheir demands were unreasonable.&quot;9. The type of contract placed for the de Havilland Comet, which is arevolutionary jet type, involving abnormal commercial risks for the manufacturer,is an indication of the normal businesslike methods of an enterprising firm.It has been repeatedly stated, however, that the aircraft industry generally isnot prepared to negotiate such binding contracts with the Ministry of Supply.On this perhaps it is only necessary to comment that neither &quot;the foreign competitors of B.O.A.C. nor the private British companies are required to acceptthe present system.   They are free to purchase in any available world market
and if they purchase in the British market they expect, and receive, as a matterof course, fixed price quotations in advance, together with precise delivery datesand performance specifications. Thus the existing procedure has put thestatutory Corporations in a position in which alone among operators they arerestricted in procurement of their aircraft by conditions that are not imposed by the British aircraft industry on foreign operators or even on British operatorsother than the three Corporations.10. Owing to the past history of the relationship between the manufacturers and the Ministry of Supply (and its predecessors the Ministry of aircraft production and Air Ministry), based primarily on the need for maintaining amanufacturing potential for military reasons, it is extremely doubtful whethercontracts placed by that Department can ever satisfactorily implement theprinciples laid down in the Prime Minister&apos;s instruction of September, 1946.The aircraft industry has enjoyed, and will continue to enjoy the shelter ofmilitary contracts in which they are safeguarded against normal commercialrisks, and they would naturally be opposed to any change in dealing withmarginal production for civil purposes. It seems probable that nothing short of placing the direct contractural responsibility with the Air Transport Corporationswho, like their competitors, would insist on normal commercial contracts, will succeed in breaking this tradition.11. As regards (ii) (direct contractual relationship between the corporations and the manufacturer), it is fundamentally unsound that the Corporations shouldbe required to accept financial responsibility for their aircraft requirements,without having the deciding voice in determining the prices and conditions of contract. All the difficulties inherent in this situation are clearly brought out inthe conclusions of the Courtney Committee Report. Paragraph 67 of the Report,for example, states : &quot; It is clear that both the Ministry of Supply and the Ministry of CivilAviation were concerned at the situation as it was revealed after the FinalConference. The Ministry of Supply have told us that, as agents of theMinistry of Civil Aviation, who were the effective principals in the transaction, they could have done relatively little beyond pointing out thecost of the modifications in terms of money and delay. This in fact, wasone of the purposes of the Civil Aircraft Modifications Committee of theMinistry of Supply, on which both the Ministry of Civil Aviation and. the corporations were represented.&quot;12. The fact that the aircraft is the sole revenue earning asset of the air corporations, by itself, establishes the need for giving them the right to decide the aircraft they require and to place the contract for the production order ontheir own terms and conditions as they may emerge from the normal processes of negotiation as between buyer and seller. The growing volume of informedopinion which supports this view is well expressed in the article &quot; Flying Blind &quot;which appeared in the Economist of 6th March, 1948. The existing procedurereveals many of the defects which gave rise to the strictures of the SelectCommittee on National Expenditure in their secret reports of August, 1942 and march, 1944, on War-time Tank Production which have since been published asCmd. 6865. The criticisms contained in these Reports of the Ministry of Supplyorganisation for production of tanks stress the tendency of the Ministry of supply to underrate the user&apos;s point of view, and emphasise the paramount importanceof the principle that the user should have what he wants. In paragraph 39 oftheir Report of March 1944 the Committee reach the conclusion that: &quot; The right arrangement in principle is that there should be a singleoverriding responsibility, and that this should rest with the War Office[i.e., in this instance read Corporations] as the authority that is to stand, orfall, by the result.&quot;Again, in paragraph 46 of the same Report, the Committee state: &quot; In the case of the Ministry of Supply, one danger of the existingdivision of responsibility involving their interposition as an intermediary between the user and the producer, is that they may interpret the GeneralStaff [Corporations&apos;] demands in a way which does not meet a fightingsoldier&apos;s [an airline operators] requirements.&quot;13. As the Corporations have stated in their Reports on the Accounts for1946-47, their commercial success or failure is vitally dependent on the type of aircraft they operate.  Owing to the many aspects of airline operation which must
416be taken into account in deciding the aircraft type, and the planning of the entry of the aircraft into service (see paragraph 4), only the most overwhelming reasonsshould prevent the normal direct contractual relationship between user andmanufacturer. This is true of all the foreign competitors of the Corporations andBritish private companies. It will be true of the British Transport Commissionin respect of the locomotives, road vehicles and other equipment which it mustorder for its undertaking. It will also be true for other socialised industries. one could conceive of many paper arguments which could be advanced in favour ofthe centralisation of the purchase of the requirements of the socialised industries in a Government Department, but the maximum advantages accrue and all manner of difficulties are avoided if the user deals directly with the manufacturer.C. Arguments which have been adduced in defence of Ministry of Supplyordering of civil aircraft and comments thereon14. The arguments which have been advanced in the case of civil aircraftorders to justify exceptionally the interposition of the Ministry of Supply betweenthe Corporations and manufacturers at all stages are : (i) that a Government subvention is required to finance the developmentof new aircraft types;(ii) that the repository of knowledge and the provision for aeronautical research and development is concentrated in the Ministry of Supply;(iii) that the Ministry of Supply must control the capacity and potential ofthe aircraft industry, and be responsible for allocation of these resources:(iv) that there is need for a healthy industry in peace time and for assistingexploitation of export markets;(v) that the experience and bulk ordering of the Ministry of Supply enables them to secure better prices;(vi) that there is a saving of man-power in utilising the Contracts directorate of the Ministry of Supply.15. The first four of the foregoing arguments are accepted statements of factor policy, but, neither individually nor in combination, do they create real obstacles to the procurement of the Corporations&apos; aircraft requirements by the direct negotiation of contracts with the manufacturer. Indeed, the logical conclusionof the contention that all the aeronautical research and development knowledge and resources are concentrated in the Ministry of Supply would be that civil aircraft should be designed in the Ministry of Supply. In fact, however, theMinistry of Supply contend that the primary responsibility for a new typerightly rests with the firm that undertakes the design and the functions of theMinistry of Supply and its establishments are mainly advisory.16. The matters of opinion ((v) and (vi) of paragraph 14) are open to seriousdoubt. As regards the question of negotiation of price, the Corporations contend,with justification, that prices of aircraft, spares and equipment ordered throughthe Ministry of Supply are not available until long after the orders have beenplaced and, indeed sometimes until long after deliveries have been made. Thishas, in fact, led to the qualification of the certificate of the Auditor of theB.E.A. Accounts 1946/47. Moreover, the Corporations complain that whenprices do become available they are usually provisional and subject to unpredictableadditions. Both B.S.A.A. and B.O.A.C. are now complaining of the heavilyincreased costs of the Tudor by comparison with original estimates. The aircraft industry as a whole does not appear to have reverted since the war to normal commercial methods of accounting while the Ministry of Supply continues to apply the principles of Government Vote accounting which differ materially from commercial accounting. Until the aircraft industry adopts normal commercialpractice and the Ministry of Supply assimilates its accounting processes to therequirements of business accounts, on which the accounting systems of the corporations are, and must be, based, difficulties are unavoidable in carryingon business in a businesslike way. Such a situation also creates difficulties for the corporations in their relations with their business associates. For instance, inthe course of negotiations last year with the Australian Government forpartnership operation by B.O.A.C. and Quantas Airways of the Kangaroo route,the Australian Government and airline representatives complained that engineoverha,ul and other prices, secured through Ministry of Supply contracts, wereexcessive, and they were not prepared to accept them as a basis of commercial35609 ^
settlement of the respective liabilities of the two companies. B.O.A.C. were forced to make concessions to the Australian viewpoint, involving them in alarger share of loss on operations. As a result of recent discussions betweenthe Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Ministry of Supply, delays in the operationof accounting processes, as distinct from delays inherent in the absence of pre-negotiated prices, should be eliminated.17. The secondary argument of the saving of man-power through the useof the Contracts Directorate of the Ministry of Supply is equally open to question.The Corporations must obviously have their own Contracts or Contract LiaisonDepartments and, under present arrangements they have formed contractco-ordinating organisations for bulk purchase wherever this course is ofadvantage. It is extremely doubtful whether any additional staff required inthe Corporations&apos; Contract organisations for ordering their own aircraft wouldoutweigh the staff which could be released by the Ministry of Supply ContractsDirectorate if this work were transferred.18. In addition to the foregoing arguments in defence of Ministry of Supplyordering, it is urged by the Ministry of Supply that the procedures for orderingcivil and military aircraft should be brought into line.19. In so far as the Ministry of Supply proposals are designed to bringcivil aircraft procedure into line with military aircraft procedure, they ovelook the fundamental differences of the purposes served by the aircraft. Commercialoperating considerations, which only the operators can specify must be at the root of civil aircraft development. Aspects such as the location of components,the cabin and cockpit layout, maintenance requirements and desirable service lifecan only be decided by the user. Economics of commercial operation must be thebasis for civil aircraft development. . Sheer fighting performance is the primerequirement of military types. Some of the essential differences between the basicdesign considerations of military and civil types are these : Military(1) Efficiency as a weapon.(2) Performance must be a maximumwithin limitations of carryingessential weapons, equipment andcrew.(3) Crew arrangements relate pri-marily to efficient use of the air-craft as a weapon; physiologicalconditions are brought to thetolerable level only.(4) Flying qualities must relateprimarily to weapon efficiency,i.e., use of the aircraft in its role,within over-riding considerations of safety and training.(5) Crew escape is a dominatingconsideration.CivilEffectiveness as a vehicle of transport.Overall economy must be a maximumwithin over-riding conditions of safety, reliability, competition,comfort.Crew arrangements must have regardprimarily to safe operation in allweather conditions when flying toschedule, and hence place greatestemphasis on reduction of fatigueand adequate provision of fryingand navigational aids.Flying qualities must be related to ease and simplicity, especially in the critical manoeuvres of approach,landing and take-off; to giving acomfortable ride, i.e., primarily to reducing fatigue and risk ofaccident.Safe conveyance of passengers underall conditions of weather, terrainand climate is the dominatingconsideration.20. Thus, to sum up, it is difficult to find any substantial argument which requires that the Air Corporations should be deprived of the rights (a) to decide the aircraft they require and the engines by which they are to be powered, (b) todetermine, subject to the capacity of the industry beirig available, when theproduction order should be placed, and (c) to place the contract for the productionorder on terms and conditions freely negotiated in the normal commercial way.D. Proposals for future ordering of aircraft in consonance with the basic factors which govern the position21. In approaching this question it should be recalled that before the warit was the usual practice for the subsidised civil airline companies to order theirown aircraft direct from the manufacturers.  The canalising of ordering through
the Ministry of Supply developed under the abnormal conditions prevailing just before and during the war; and, as has been demonstrated in paragraphs 15 to 20above, the continuance of the procedure is no longer appropriate to the different circumstances as regards the parties to be served and the machine to be produced.It follows, however, that if the assistance required from public funds todevelop new aircraft types is to be expended to the maximum advantage, and iffull use is to be made of the research and development resources of the Ministryof Supply, without impairing the paramount responsibility of the Corporationsfor the selections of the type of aircraft they are to use (for the compellingreasons given in paragraph 4 above), it is essential to establish co-co-ordination between the parties concerned in the planning of new aircraft types. It was withthis object in view the Inter-departmental Civil Aircraft Requirements Com-mittee was established under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry Self in May 1946.The Committee comprised representatives of the Ministry of Civil Aviation, theMinistry of Supply, the Treasury and the three Corporations, and they werecharged with drawing up aircraft programmes in the light of the requirementsdetailed by the Corporations.22. This body has performed a most useful function for the purposes forwhich it was created and its retention, with some modifications, would be animportant feature of future machinery. Another feature of importance is therecent formation, at the suggestion of the Minister of Civil Aviation, of a centralagency in connection with the procurement of aircraft for the three Corpora-tions. This body is a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Chairmen of the corporations and is known as the Aircraft Procurement Committee. Its member-ship comprises technical, engineering and supply representatives. It will secureco-ordination of aircraft requirements, so as to obviate material differences of design in the case of an aircraft which is basically suitable for the operations of more than one Corporation. It will thus ensure formation of one generalspecification of aircraft for common use; it will canalise the representation ofthe three Corporations on the Civil Aircraft Requirements Committee and soavoid independent membership of the individual Corporations; it will representthe Corporations in their relationships with the Ministry of Supj)ly and the manufacturers, and so confer upon the latter all the advantages of dealing witha single purchasing agent. Finally, technical manpower effort, which is in short supply, will be economised and the best available expert knowledge and experiencewill be concentrated for the benefit of all the Corporations.23. It is of the very essence of this body, however, that it shall be formed from within the Corporations, as their servant, and not be allowed to becometheir master. An independent procurement urgency, superimposed on the Cor-porations, would simply perpetuate all the disadvantages of the present system.In effect, it would constitute a mere substitute for the Ministry of Supply in thepresent regime, but with the added disadvantage of relegating the Air Corpora-tions to almost the passive role of operators, charged with the commercialexploitation of an asset they would have little or no voice in selecting.24.   An   outline of the future procedure,  designed to satisfy all thedesiderata set out in paragraph 4 above, would be as follows : (1) Co-ordination of the planning of new aircraft types. This would becarried out through the remodelled Inter-departmental Civil aircraft requirements Committee. Sir Henry Self had quite unique experi-ence of aircraft production but he ceased to be Chairman on his appointment as Deputy Chairman of the Electricity Commission. Itis proposed that his successor should be someone with a broad generalknowledge of aviation, or someone outstanding of the business execu-tive type. The appointment should be made by the Minister of CivilAviation who has the statutory responsibility for the developmentof civil aviation and also happens to be the most natural of the directly interested parties. In order further to strengthen the Committee itis proposed to call upon the manufacturers, as necessary, to partiei-pate in the work of the Committee and to add a representative ofthe R.A.F., which is interested in relation to Transport Commandrequirements (c./., the Civil Aviation Development Committee reeom-mended by the Harold Brown Committee on the Production of CivilAeroplanes (Cmd. 6038, 1939)).35609 g 2
(2) Simplification and unification of the participation of the corporations in formulating and ordering aircraft requirements.This would be effected through the medium of the Aircraft Procure-ment Sub-Committee as a central procurement agency of the threeCorporations (see paragraph 22 above).(3) A Progressing Sub-Committee, or Project Party, of the Inter-depart-mental Civil Aircraft Requirements Committee should be responsiblefor the progress of each type planned in the programme.(4) The Ministry of Supply should issue agreed design requirements to theindustry, on which tenders for prototypes would be submitted.(5) Tenders should then be examined by a Design Conference of all con-cerned and placed in order of merit. Great weight must be givenhere to the Corporations&apos; preference. The confidence of the operatorin designer and manufacturer is of vital importance to the successfulevolution of a new machine. The Ministry of Supply would havethe right to reject a particular manufacturer as part of their overallresponsibility for the control of the national resources of the industry.(6) The Ministry of Supply should place orders for prototypes, subject tothe specifications for the prototypes conforming to the operators&apos;requirements. There would be great advantage in a Corporationhaving some financial stake in the design even at this prototype stage.(7) Finally, the Corporations should place their own production orders forthe aircraft, either where there is no prototype, or, where there is aprototype, at the stage they judge to be appropriate which wouldvary according to individual circumstances. These production ordersmust be placed direct with the manufacturers, the Corporations making their own conditions and contracts.15th March, 1948.annex extract from Ministry of Civil Aviation Act, 1945Chapter 211. (1) It shall be lawful for His Majesty to appoint a Minister of CivilAviation (in this Act referred to as &quot; the Minister &quot;), who shall be charged withthe general duty of organising, carrying out and encouraging measures for thedevelopment of civil aviation, for the designing, development and production ofcivil aircraft, for the promotion of safety and efficiency in the use thereof, andfor research into questions relating to air navigation;Provided that this subsection shall not authorise the production of civil aircraft by the Minister.(2) The acquisition and disposal of aircraft, aero-engines and aviationequipment in discharge of the Ministers said duty shall be subject to the approvalof the Treasury.(iii) AIRLINE CORPORATIONS(A) introduction the Corporations in submitting to the Committee their views on theprocedure for ordering aircraft have had special regard to the functions of the corporations and the way in which such functions should be exercised by them in implementing their obligations under the provisions of the Civil AviationAct, 1946.The functions of the Corporations, as contained in Section 2 of the CivilAviation Act, are to provide air transport services in any part of the world andto secure that such services are developed to the best advantage and, in particular,that they are provided at reasonable charges. The Corporations have power to do anything which is calculated to facilitate the discharge of their functions, or isincidental or conducive thereto.The first consideration of the Corporations in providing air transport services in accordance with their statutory obligations must be the selection and purchase of suitable aircraft and spare parts at reasonable prices. Almost thewhole of the Corporations&apos; revenue is earned in the air and their expenditure,provided that the necessary ground facilities and maintenance bases are available,is mainly governed by the suitability of the aircraft for their tasks and for rapid and economical maintenance so as to give high annual utilisation.
The choice of aircraft is directly related to the operating plans of the corporations, with which the Minister of Civil Aviation is concerned under theprovisions of the Civil Aviation Act. Section 12 of the Act provides for submission by the Corporations to the Minister of Civil Aviation of annualprogrammes of air transport services and estimates of revenue and expenditure and Section 22 obliges the Corporations to submit to the Minister in respect ofeach planning period of three years a programme of services, and estimates of receipts and expenditure on revenue or capital account. The Minister is alsodirectly concerned with the plans of the Corporations in connection with suchmatters as international air transport agreements and the provision andsuitability of aerodromes. Close consultation is therefore essential between theMinistry of Civil Aviation and the Corporations.The Ministry of Supply is also intimately concerned with the aircraftprogrammes of the Corporations in three ways. The Ministry has available in itsresearch and technical establishments a fund of knowledge and experience of thedevelopment of modern aircraft to which the Corporations should have access.Their plans for new aircraft should be developed in close consultation with theMinistry of Supply so as to get the maximum advantage from its technicalexperience and facilities for development work. As the Ministry has a general responsibility for the capacity and structure of the aircraft industry in thiscountry, it has a direct concern in the allocation of the Corporations&apos; orders for civil aircraft in order to ensure the best overall use of the limited capacity of theindustry. The Ministry of Supply, also has a direct interest in the knowledge tobe gained during the development of new types of aircraft which would add tothe general fund of aeronautical technique of this country, and should obviously be closely associated with such developments.In order to give the Committee a sketch of the way in which the presentsituation has arisen and the views of the Corporations as to future procedure,this statement deals with the following matters :. -(i) The procedure for the ordering of aircraft and spares, involving directrelationship between seller and buyer, as followed by Imperial Airwaysand British Airways in the pre-war period.(ii) The procedure followed during the war.- (iii) The existing procedure which does not provide for a direct contractualrelationship as between seller and buyer and under which considerablecontrol is exercised by the Ministry of Supply.(iv) The difficulties which arise from this procedure.(v) The fundamental considerations which affect the ordering procedure.(vi) The outline of a simple ordering procedure which the Corporationsjointly recommend, as being designed to maintain full-co-operationwith the staffs of the Ministries concerned, while leaving the initiativewith the Corporations to enable them to fulfil their statutory duties and to have contractual relationships with the manufacturers.(B) Pre-War ProcedureAn outline of requirements, based on such considerations as estimated traffic,revenue, route conditions and competition, was prepared by the operator and submitted to aircraft manufacturers. Consultation and agreement with the CivilAviation Department of the Air Ministry was necessary to ensure compliance withthe conditions under which subsidy was granted. A firm of manufacturers wasselected by the operator and a contract was negotiated on a commercial basis.This gave the operator protection by means of penalties against failure of the manufacturer to deliver aircraft, in accordance with the specification, by the specified dates (see Appendix I, containing the 1935 contract for flying boats).The signing of the contract was followed by a period of close collaboration between the manufacturer and the operator, during which necessary modifications of the original design were mutually agreed.The operator kept in close touch with the construction of the aircraft bymeans of resident engineers at the manufacturers&apos; works, and on the basis oftheir reports and certificates, progress payments were made to the manufacturersin accordance with the contract.Subject to successful completion of acceptance tests, as specified in detail inthe contract (see Schedule II of Appendix I) and compliance in other respectswith the contract, the aircraft were accepted.
Such outstanding commercial types of aircraft as the Short &quot; C &quot; ClassFlying Boat and the D.H. 86 landplane were acquired by Imperial Airways underthis system of ordering.(C) Procedure during the WarDuring the War, under a Directive from the Secretary of State for Air, thepurchase of aircraft and spares for British Overseas Airways Corporation wasmade by the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Aircraft Production.In 1942 and 1943 the Brabazon Committees were set up to advise the Govern-ment on civil aircraft for the post-war period.The Ministry of Aircraft Production selected a firm to meet the broad require-ments recommended by the Brabazon Committees, in general, without competitivetendering. The operators&apos; views having been obtained, the administration of theorder was entirely in the hands of the Ministry of Aircraft Production (later theMinistry of Supply), who had the sole responsibility for allocating work to theaircraft industry.(D) Existing Procedure for the Ordering of aircraft the present procedure for ordering civil aircraft, as for example, the bristol 175 and, to some extent, the D.H. 106, is as follows : (i) The Corporation prepares an initial statement of its broad requirements for a future type of aircraft for operation on particular routes,(ii) The initial statement is submitted to the Ministry of Civil Aviation andreceives joint consideration by the Ministry and the Corporation.(iii) The Corporation amplifies its initial statement, setting out in detail itsoperational, commercial and maintenance requirements.(iv) The Ministry of Civil Aviation discusses the project with the Ministryof Supply and subject to any amendments that are agreed, after con-sultation with the Corporation, the project is considered by the Inter-Departmental Civil Aircraft Requirements Committee (known as the self Committee) containing representatives of the Ministry of CivilAviation, Ministry of Supply, the Corporations and the Treasury,(v) The Ministry of Supply, after consultations with the operator, invitescertain selected aircraft manufacturing firms to prepare design studiesbased on the project as approved by the Inter-Departmental civil aircraft Requirements Committee.(vi) The design studies received from the manufacturers are considered bythe Corporation, Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Ministry ofSupply, and a selection is made.(vii) If prototype aircraft are considered to be necessary, then after joint consultation between the Ministry of Supply, Ministry of Civil aviation-tion, the Corporations and the Treasury, prototypes are ordered bythe Ministry of Supply to their account,(viii) The price of prototypes is negotiated entirely by the Ministry of Supplyand that of the production aircraft is settled in consultation betweenthe manufacturers, the Ministry of Supply and the Corporations. Theprice of the production aircraft includes a share of the development cost as decided by the Ministry of Supply.(ix) The contract for prototypes is prepared by the Ministry of Supply inaccordance with the prescribed Government forms and brought to itsthe Corporation, Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Ministry ofSupply.(x) The contract for the production aircraft is prepared by the Ministryof Supply, in consultation with the Corporations, in accordance withthe prescribed Government forms and concluded with the manufac-turers by the Ministry of Supply as agents for the Corporation.Note. This is in accordance with the ruling of the Prime Minister,communicated by the Ministry of Civil Aviation to the Corpora-tions on 5th November, 1946 (see Appendix II), that the procedure for ordering civil aircraft for the Corporations was in future tobe based on the following principles : &quot; (a) Contracts for these aircraft should include guarantees bythe manufacturers as to performance and delivery dates,and provision for penalties if these guarantees are notfulfilled.
(b) While the orders should continue to be placed by the Ministerfor Supply and not by the Corporations themselves, inorder to secure the advantages of bulk purchase and toco-ordinate military and civil production, the ministry should place these orders as agents of and in agreementwith the Corporations, who should carry the financial risks proper to the purchaser.&quot;(xi) The Corporation then collaborates with the Ministry of Supply, theMinistry of Civil Aviation, and the manufacturers in the detailed work of development of the prototype and production aircraft,primarily from the commercial, operational and maintenance aspects.This work inevitably involves design changes and modifications fromtime to time, arising from developments of and changes in equipment,from the detailed working out of operational needs, and from construc-tional aerodynamic or other changes required by the manufacturer.A complicated procedure is involved in dealing with such modifica-tions through the Ministry of Supply and the Ministry of CivilAviation and the Civil Aircraft Modifications Committee, which iscomposed of representatives of the two Ministries. This procedure is dealt with in detail in Section (E) (iii).(xii) A percentage of the purchase price of aircraft is charged to the corporations by the Ministry of Supply, to cover the cost of contractnegotiations, progressing, inspection, accounting and administration.(E) Disadvantages which the Corporations suffer from the existing orderingprocedure:(i) The fundamental disadvantage of the present procedure is the absenceof direct contractual relationship between the Corporations and the manufacturers, who naturally, therefore, regard the Ministry ofSupply as the customer. The following extracts from the Report ofthe Courtney Committee on the Tudor I aircraft illustrate some ofthe difficulties arising from this case : -&quot; 89. The fact that British Overseas Airways corporation were not themselves the buyers of the aircraft also played its partin causing delay. On the one hand they were not subject to therestraining consideration that the cost, direct and indirect, ofevery modification was to fall on them; on the other, A. V. Roe,Limited, could not be certain how far they had to do what british overseas Airways Corporation asked if they felt that their demands were unreasonable.&quot; 90. Summing up, we consider that the root cause of the trouble lay in defective co-Operation between user and producerwhere there should have been single-minded concentration on the primary object, namely to get the aircraft into service as quickly as possible; there was such an effective divi sion of constitutionalresponsibility among the organisations concerned that each could find unimpeachable reasons for keeping its constructive activitywithin moderate limits; and on none of the parties was there suchclear financial responsibility as would have impelled action.&quot;(ii) Delays inevitably arise in the design, development and production of theaircraft as a result of the number of parties and Committees whichare concerned. Five main parties are involved, viz : the Ministryof Civil Aviation, the Ministry of Supply, the Treasury, the manufacturers and the Corporation. The Committees involvedinclude; the Inter-Departmental Civil Aircraft requirements committee, the Controller of Supplies (Aircraft) Committee of theMinistry of Supply, and the Civil Aircraft Modifications Committee.There are also a whole series of ad hoc Committees, which may becalled to discuss between the four parties concerned (i.e., the Ministryof Supply, the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the manufacturers and theCorporation) the action which should be taken in connection withsome particular detail, or some particular item of equipment.(iii) A complicated procedure is involved in dealing with modifications ordevelopments, through the medium of the Civil Aircraft ModificationsCommittee.   If the Corporations agree with the manufacturer that a
certain modification or a change in design is necessary, drawings areprepared, one of which goes to the Corporations, another to theMinistry of Supply and another to the Civil Aircraft. ModificationsCommittee and it is only after consultation between these parties and agreement by the Civil Aircraft Modifications Committee and formalacknowledgment by the Ministry of Supply, that it is in order forthe firm to go ahead in making the change; this, despite the fact that agreement had already been reached between the Corporation and the manufacturers. In addition to the delay, there is a risk that the costof&apos;a change in design, due to a mistake on the part of the designer,might be charged against the Corporation. This is avoided by the&quot; Change Order &quot; procedure used in the purchase of Boeing 377aircraft by British Overseas Airways Corporation (see Section (F)and Appendix V). .  .(iv) It may happen that the delivery arrangements are upset because theMinistry requires specific deliveries to be allocated to other users,(v) The Ministry of Supply imposes a charge of 2 per cent, of the cost on all aircraft contracts, irrespective of their magnitude or nature. Thisis stated to cover the cost of contract negotiations, progressing,inspection, accounting and administration. (In the case of the twenty-five D.H. 106 aircraft on order for British Overseas airways corporation, the charge will amount to between  200,000 and 250,000) (see Appendix III).(vi) The Ministry of Supply form of contract contains many provisions whichare incorporated by reference and does not contain provisions in theform of those usually included in commercial contracts of this nature.(F) Experience of the Corporations in Placing Direct contracts for aircraft:(i) Appendix IV contains a summary of the contract for the purchaseof Boeing 377 aircraft, which is a new type of aircraft. The procedure adopted in this case is working smoothly, the contract having been negotiated directly between the technical, financial and legalrepresentatives of the Corporation and of the manufacturers.A Detail Specification is annexed to the contract and was subjectto the closest scrutiny by the technical representatives of both partiesbefore having been finally agreed. The Detail Specification can onlybe amended (i.e., a modification introduced) by written &quot; ChangeOrders &quot; which are in a prescribed form and are signed by officialsspecifically authorised in writing by the Corporation. (For specimenform see Appendix V.)In accordance with a provision of the contract, representativesof the Corporation are posted at the manufacturers&apos; works and theserepresentatives have the right to inspect the aircraft and all materials and parts.The administration of the contract is channelled through an ad hocorganisation established at the New York office of British overseas airways Corporation, representing technical, financial, legal and other experts involved.As regards spare parts, the manufacturers undertake to supplyand deliver to the Corporation spare parts in accordance withschedules supplied by the manufacturers. The manufacturers alsoundertake to maintain stocks of spare parts for a period related tothat of the anticipated operation of the type of aircraft.(ii) Appendix VI contains the standard form of contract which british overseas Airways Corporation uses in purchasing aircraft for itsassociated Companies. It is true that these aircraft have been of established types and have not involved new design.(G) Existing Procedure for the Ordering of Spares(i) An open contract is raised by the Ministry of Supply on the manu-facturers covering any range of spares for the type of aircraft orengine which is the subject of the contract.(ii) The Corporation raises official orders directly on the manufacturers forthe spares required.(iii) The Corporation is notified at a later date of the prices agreed betweenthe Ministry and the manufacturers, and it is a condition of the con-tract that the prices at these agreed rates shall be paid by the Corpora-tion direct to the manufacturers.
(iv) As for aircraft, the Ministry of Supply makes an additional charge tothe Corporations, based on a percentage of the value of the orders(H) Disadvantages of the A bove Procedure(i) The Corporation has no control over the prices of the spares.   Recently,British Overseas Airways Corporation received an invoice for over 1,000,000 for spares supplied under a Ministry of Supply contract and. on pressing for further information was told that the prices hadbeen agreed with the supplier as fair and reasonable.(ii) At present&quot; the Corporation is not receiving invoices for spares at orshortly after the date of their delivery, as would be the normal com-mercial practice. Such invoices as have been received relate to sparesdelivered, many months previously. It is understood that it would beimpossible under the arrangements with the Ministry of Supply for supplies to be invoiced at a firm price until some considerable time after delivery.(iii) Accurate costing is impossible if prices have to be assessed pending thereceipt of invoices or if the invoiced prices are provisional only.Because of the present arrangements the Corporation is forced to coston the basis of assessed prices which frequently prove to be very different from the actual price when the latter is advised. the revision of costs necessarily involves much additional work, and toofrequently it is found that the management has relied on cost figures which prove to be inaccurate.(iv) Additional invoices have still to be received from the Ministry of supply for their charge on all spares provided under these arrangements.Additional accounting work is involved in adding this surcharge to each individual invoice on receipt from the supplier so as to record thefull cost of the spares to the Corporation, and in reconciling the total,charges with the amount invoiced subsequently by the Ministry ofSupply.(v) Unless invoices are received promptly after delivery of the goods, theCorporation has difficulty in providing accurate prices for customs duty purposes on spares sent overseas.(vi) The very serious delays in obtaining prices necessitated a bulk settlementof outstanding invoices at the end of the financial year 1946-47 andprevented the production of accurate cost account for that year.(vii) Here again the manufacturers regard the Ministry, not the Corporations,as their customers and they do not give the Corporations the sameservice as if they had direct price control of their orders.(viii) It has been stated by the manufacturers that the prices they are allowedto charge are such that they are unable to give the Corporations aftersales service. In a recent letter from the Bristol Aeroplane company to British Overseas Airways Corporation, it was stated that thetheir normal after sales service and guarantee and had the contract for the supply of engines been on a normal commercial basis, they wouldhave included in their price a small element to cover this contingent liability. As the contract was with the Ministry of Supply and suchelement in the price was deliberately excluded, it was impracticable for the Company to deal with the matter on any basis other than asprescribed bv the Ministry and this excluded free service and freereplacements.(ix) The manufacturers have no incentive to provide and hold their owncommercial responsibility essential stocks of spares to comply withrequirements as estimated by the Corporations. The onus is entirely on the Corporations to order the spares which they estimate to berequired and to bear the financial responsibility.(I) Fundamental Considerations Affecting Ordering procedure ordering of aircraft of new design is admittedly a complex problem, bothin view of its nature and of the various interests concerned. In the orderingprocedure which they recommend the Corporations have tried to meet the following conditions by a simple method which avoids a multiplicity of committees and placed.Corporation the full benefit of35609h
leaves responsibility at each stage where it rightly belongs, thus avoiding delaysand indecisions : (i) The Corporations should have the main responsibility for selecting theaircraft which in their judgment are best suited to their requirements,after full consultation with the two Ministries concerned.(ii) Both Ministries have certain responsibilities as regards the provision of aircraft for the Corporations as set out in the introduction to this paper.(ill) A number of specific factors have to be reconciled in the choice of the design of a civil aircraft: the estimate of the traffic on the routes itwill fly for a number of years ahead, and the characteristics of theaircraft as regards payload, comfort, speed, range, take-off and landing performance, which will enable it to carry such traffic economi-cally in competition with other airlines. Its cost of operation will depend mainly on the possibility of high annual utilisation at lowmaintenance cost. Good engineering is the basis of success of an air-line. The choice of the design should therefore be based on the accumulated operating and engineering, maintenance- and overhaulexperience of the operator together with the knowledge which the ministries can contribute, the initiative remaining as far as possiblein the hands of the Corporations,(iv) When the production stage is reached the contract should be placed andadministered by the Corporations so as to ensure the direct relationship between buyer and seller. Not only will this provide the most favour-able conditions for rapid and smooth progress, but it will bring the manufacturers into direct touch with the Corporations&apos; operational and engineering experience and requirements. Such experience ispossessed by the operators alone and on it the successful design of future civil aircraft must be based,(v) Arrangements for pooling the experience of the three Corporations andco-ordinating their aircraft requirements will avoid unnecessaryduplication of effort or differences in their orders. This should applyalso, as far as possible, to the various categories of airlines with whichthe Corporations are associated (e.g. Qantas Empire Airways) or inwhich they have an interest [e.g. British West Indian Airways,Cyprus Airways and Hong Kong Airways) or to which they act asadvisers ie.g. East and West African Airways, Malayan Airways andIraqi Airways).(vi) The procedure must take into account the question of finance as the rapid increase in the cost of development and construction of moderncivil aircraft has created a major problem for the operators. Theheavy costs of the Government Aeronautical Establishments, theresources of which are available to the Corporations, are borne by theMinistry of Supply. But who is to bear the heavy costs of development and prototype production, and of underwriting the potential losses ota new type should the demand not be sufficient to spread the initialcost of design, jigs, tools and planning? If all these costs were to fallon the Corporations there would be no chance of their competing oneconomic terms on international routes. This has been recognised quitefrankly in the recent Report &quot; Survival in the Air Age &quot; of president truman&apos;s Air Policy Commission, who accept a national responsibility in this matter, which they propose should be met both directly by government subvention and by mail subsidies to the airlines. In thiscountry too, part of the responsibility must rest with the Government,and decisions will be needed as to the fairest method of allocating costsat each stage and of underwriting certain risks. Could not this be theresponsibility of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Aircraft.   Requirements on which the Treasury is represented?(vii) The ordering procedure may have to meet three different sets of circumstances under which orders for aircraft may be placed :_(a) When the Corporations are ordering aircraft of a conventionalpattern which is of no interest to the Ministry of Supply fromthe point of view of development and when no&quot; prototye order is involved.(b) When the Ministry is interested as well as the corporations and wishes to place orders for prototypes for the general benefitof aviation in. advance of the production order.
(c) When the Ministry wishes to place an order for a type sounconventional or having only a doubtful commercial appliea-tion in which case the Corporations might be interested in the prototype but not in a production order.The procedure suggested can easily be adjusted to meet these varyingconditions.(j) The Corporations&apos; Aircraft Requirements and Contracts CommitteeThe activities of the three Corporations are at present co-ordinated by anAirline Chairmen&apos;s Committee working through a number of sub-committees ofCorporation officials, who consider the many problems in which the Corporationshave a mutual interest in order to share experience and to arrange for jointworking wherever this is economical. So far as the responsibilities of the corporations are concerned, the key to the ordering procedure which they reconi-mend is the Aircraft Requirements and Contracts Committee, which the AirlineChairmen have formed for the purpose of joint consultation and agreement ontheir aircraft requirements. It will pool all their knowledge and experiencebearing on this matter, and will canalise all discussions and negotiations with thetwo Ministries, and at a later stage negotiations with manufacturers.The terms of reference of the Committee given in the Annex show the partit is intended to take in the ordering procedure explained in the next section.(k) The Aircraft Ordering Procedure Recommended by the Corporations(i) The Corporations must naturally have under constant review the composition of their fleets of aircraft and those of their associated companies in the light of their commercial, operational and engineeringrequirements. In view of the time taken to produce new types of air-craft they must plan their fleets for seven to ten years ahead.(ii) The representatives of each Corporation on the Aircraft requirements and Contracts Committee will be in close touch with their own possiblerequirements, with those of the other Corporations, and, will keep boththeir own Corporations and the Committee informed as to the position.(iii) In the future the main fleet of each Corporation is likely to consist ofnot more than two or three types of standardised aircraft in order tosecure economical operation. These aircraft should normally have alife of five to seven years in view of all the heavy first costs incidental&apos;to the introduction of a new type. Hence the number of new aircraftactually in production at any time will be small, but there will befrequent discussions of possible j)rojects in which the representatives&quot;on the Aircraft Requirements and Contracts Committee will be associated.(iv) As soon as a definite need for a new aircraft emerges., the aircraft requirements and Contracts Committee will receive from individualCorporations their commercial and operational requirements in termsof traffic to be handled, routes, frequencies and expected competition.They will formulate in consultation with the officials of the Corporationconcerned broad aircraft requirements to meet these needs in the lightof the accumulated practical experience of the Corporations, especiallyin its engineering aspects, consulting specialists in the Ministries and outside as necessary. The possible needs of all the Corporations will begiven full consideration at this stage to ensure that the aircraft likelyto emerge will have a maximum usefulness to all.(v) If the project looked promising the Committee would have informal discussions with the Ministry of Supply on its technical aspects, andthe Corporations would discuss with the Ministry of Civil Aviationits bearing on routes, frequencies, competitive requirements and aero-- dromes, and its effect on the annual and triennial programmes and estimates of the Corporations. In these preliminary discussions withthe Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Chairman of the Committee andthe relevant members would take part.(vi) When the project assumed the shape of a definite requirement, detailed discussions would follow with both Ministries on the following lines,(vii) A Project Party would be formed in consultation with both Ministriesto discuss and. agree the implications of the requirement as regardsresearch, design and development and the practicability of its realisa-tion. The Project Party would finally agree the outline requirement.35609 h 2
(viii) This requirement would then be put to the Inter-Departmental Beqniie-ments Committee for approval, the Aircraft Requirements and Con-tracts Committee being present at the meeetings. The eonstitratioaiof the Inter-Departmental Civil Aircraft Requirements OonmEatteewould require amendment to permit representation on that Oomirmttfeeof the Aircraft Requirements and Contracts Committee.(ix) After approval by the Inter-Departmental Civil Aircraft requirements committee, the Aircraft Requirements and Contracts Committee would discuss with the Ministry of Supply the aircraft firms who would feeavailable to them and who should be invited to submit desisn studieswith estimates of costs.(x) When the design studies have been received, the Project Party wouldassess the merits of the designs submitted and they would recommend to the Aircraft Requirements and Contracts Committee their selection.(xi) The Corporations would then be responsible for deciding on the designto be adopted.(xii) The Aircraft Requirements and Contracts Committee discuss with theMinistry of Supply the need for a prototype order and such orders axeplaced by the Ministry.(xiii) The Corporations, through&apos;the Aircraft Requirements and Contrac-irsCommittee and in consultation with the Ministries, decide when a production order should be placed.(xiv) The Aircraft Requirements and Contracts Committee then negotiatesa production contract on behalf of the Corporations with the firmselected and administers the contract when placed.15th March, 1948.AnnexTerms of Reference of the Corporations&apos; Aircraft Reqtjtrements *omContracts Committee1.

There will also be an official with appropriatetechnical qimafifications to act as liaison officer with the Ministry ofSupply.(iv) SOCIETY OF BRITISH AIRCRAFT CONSTRUCTORSThe Society welcome the opportunity to present a statement of opinionregarding the procedure for ordering aircraft for the services of the threeAirways Corporations and to make recommendations for improvements in existing arrangements for the dbttainrag of designs, the ordering of prototypes and theproduction of aircraft The subject is of vital importance to the aircraft industry, in that the Corporations are virtually the only potential British users of the larger civil airerafffc. and experience has proved that manufacturing industrycannot build for export alone.A. General CommemsThe Society^ general views on the procurement of civil aircraft, which havebeen expressed on vaiions occasions, were submitted in oral evidence in July 1947before Sub-Committee C of the Select Committee on Estimates (House ofCommons Paper No. 14^ dated 7th August, 1947). They may be stated asfollows : 1. In the Soeiety&apos;s experience the best civil aircraft have been produced by constructors whose design teams have worked specifically to meet the user&apos;srequirement. Upon operational and technical matters direct contact (though notnecessarily direct contract) between the constructor and the user is essential andmust be encouraged. Consequently, if airline operations were self-supporting inthe full commercial sense and if in aircraft and aero engine development it were practicable to separate civil from military work, the direct purchasing of aircraft by the operators from the instructors would, being natural and logical, become the normal procedure, as many critics outside the Industry have recommended.2. But in fact the economics of civil aviation and the complexity of modernaircraft are such that to-day neither operator nor constructor, whether jointly orseparately, can bear the cost or the effort of research and development andprototype manufacture involved in the introduction of a new type of major airlinerof an advanced design, and, if this country is to have its own civil airliners, their development must be sponsored and substantially financed by the Government, atleast for some years to crame.(Note. In the United States the Aircraft Industry, now that war-timeassistance from the Government has ceased and post-war tax refundshave been used up, has run into serious difficulty in financing thedevelopment of new civil types. Numerous solutions have been putforward and the Pirssident?s Air Policy Commission, after examining the situation from the point of view of national interest, has proposed the establishment of an Aircraft Development Corporation &apos;&apos; to provide an orderly specialised medium.....for the development of commercialaircraft and components.&quot; See &quot; Survival in the Air Age,&quot; being theCommission^ report to the President, p. 137-8).3. In view off the comparatively limited technical resources both of menand of equipment available in this country in the field of aeronautics, andthe difficulty off expansion in present conditions, the Society attach greatimportance to the combination of technical effort in the development of civil andmilitary aircraft.   No aero engine, other than low-powered units, with a civil
future is without a Service background, which provides the only possibility ofdevelopment expenditure on a scale adequate to ensure technical success and operational reliability. If the Ministry of Supply had no part in the orderingof civil aircraft, and if pressure of research and development on military projectswere maintained on the present scale, civil aviation might lose the benefit of a mostimportant source of knowledge and experience.4. The scale of expenditure and the use of resources involved in theconstruction of large aircraft and of all that goes with them is now such thatfactors of national economic policy arise which only the Government can evaluateobjectively. For example, in 1947, the Cabinet decided, as a matter of national policy, and in spite of strong arguments from the operators, to reject a proposalto purchase a further quantity of American aircraft for B.O.A.C. Similarly, thepresent proposal to utilise Canadian aircraft is a matter which will have to bedetermined on grounds of economic policy.5. On grounds of national security it is of the greatest importance that theAircraft Industry in this country should be ready for adaptation to any emergency. This applies particularly to the way in which design and manufactureis spread throughout the Industry (in the national interest competitive selectionmay not always be the wisest method of placing new work).While military usefulness is not, and probably ought never to be, a decidingfactor in the design of British civil aircraft, the existence of Service air transport means that, with suitable modifications, civil aircraft types shouldpreferably be adaptable to Service transport needs. The co-ordination ofproduction programmes between civil and Service versions will frequently call for an official decision, and the Ministry of Supply, with its background of knowledge of Service requirements, would appear to be well fitted to bear such a responsibility.6. The aircraft required by the Corporations are complex in design andtheir detailed specifications cannot be available at the outset of the project. Adecision in principle to obtain a new type of aircraft is not in itself sufficient tocreate a binding contract, and, if contract conditions are to include penalties inrespect of performance and delivery, it will be necessary precisely to define what should be included in the contract, and precise definition may prove to beimpossible. Unless a flexible procedure such as the Instructions to Proceed adoptedby the Ministry of Supply is used, great delays will result in contract definitionand, therefore, in ultimate aircraft deliveries. The Ministry of Supply is betterorganised than the Corporations for purchasing under these conditions.7, Nor should it be overlooked that the procedure of ordering of aircraft is also a complex matter requiring experience of the Industry, knowledge of manufacturing methods, trends of engineering costs and the like. This experi-ence has been acquired and is constantly kept up-to-date by the Directorate of contracts in the Ministry of Supply. For the numbers of aircraft involved itwould be unnecessary and extravagant for each Corporation to have an elaborateaircraft purchasing department.B. Experience of Post-War ProjectsOne point which must strike anyone examining ordering practice in relationto civil aircraft during the past five years is that there appears to be no routineprocedure common to each project. Almost every project has emerged as an exceptional case making it difficult to agree at the outset what constitute the&quot; existing arrangements &quot; in which improvements are now to be sought by theCommittee. The end of the war left civil aviation with uncertain prospects.&quot; Thetwo neAv Airways Corporations had not yet been established by Statute and b.O.A.C. existed only on its wartime footing. By way of making a fresh start with civil aviation recommendations had been made by the Brabazon Committeein 1943, as a result of which various projects had been put in hand by the Ministryof Aircraft Production necessarily, in the circumstances, without the binding-commitment of the intended users. Even if the recommendations of the BrabazonCommittee, taken as a whole, had been appropriate to the immediate post-warneeds of the airlines, the subsequent partial and hesitant implementation whichthey in fact received would have caused difficulties. The Brabazon Committeeand M.A.P. were handicapped partly by lack of user&apos;s experience and partly bythe continuing pressure of war requirements upon the Aircraft Industry and theGovernment Establishments. As matters have turned out the period since theend of the war has been a most unfortunate experience, both for British civil
aviation and for the Aircraft Industry. The report of the Committee of Investi-gation upon the Tudor I makes it evident that division of responsibility and uncertainty about procedure have seriously impaired initiative and efficiency.It is probable that investigations into the progress of other projects willdemonstrate, though perhaps not with such unfortunate results, that the Tudor has not been the only aircraft project to suffer from lack of defined responsibilities.Many lessons have now been learnt from which all concerned have profited, andthe Society do not consider it to be of much advantage now to the Committee to engage in a detailed historical analysis of the circumstances in which each of theimmediate post-war civil types came into service.C. Recommendations Regarding Ordering procedure. *The Society have no doubt that the user must initiate a project by a preliminary statement of requirements and for this purpose he must be in aposition to state requirements effectively. This is no small matter. Those whopress for direct contact between operator and constructor should bear in mind that B.S.A.A.C. have never yet equipped themselves with an adequate project staff and have simply bought their aircraft &quot; off the shelf &quot;t; that B.E.A., apart fromtheir co-operation with Vickers in the Viscount project- which they have abruptlyrevoked 4iave not brought forward any design requirements of their own; andthat B.O.A.C. have so far put forward only one statement of specific requirements-the Medium Range Empire aircraft, and even in this case the statement of requirements was, until submitted to criticism by the Industry, simply a copy ofan existing American type.2. The user having prepared a preliminary statement of requirementsseveral design firms must be given the opportunity of presenting in. the form of design tenders their solution to the user&apos;s requirements, and the best design mustbe selected. It is increasingly clear that with the high cost of modern prototypesselection will have to proceed to an even greater extent on the evidence of designtenders rather than competitive prototypes. The nomination of suitable firms and the selection of the most likely design study is almost certainly a matter onwhich, having regard to the degree of design effort entailed and the possible clash with military and naval demands on the same firms, the Ministry of Supply withits overall responsibility for the Aircraft Industry must have a part to play -possibly advisory but more probably of an executive character.3. As a necessary feature of any new project contracts must be arrangedcovering construction of wind-tunnel models, mockups, appropriate research work,at least two prototype aircraft and the appropriate engines, propellers and otheraccessories and equipment. These last may involve a wide range of items, e.g..pressurisation equipment, radio, anti-icing schemes, and many other ancillaryfeatures of modern civil aircraft. It is relevent that work on such problems is proceeding constantly under Ministry of Supply contracts, or at Ministry ofSupply research establishments; and there is a wide measure of agreement in theIndustry that contracts for a project of this character (and complete unanimityif it entails novelty in technical development) should be the responsibility of theMinistry of Supply.4. As soon as possible arrangements must be made for production. Whetherthis step should be taken before the prototype has proved itself in flight and operational experience has been acquired depends upon the urgency of theoperator&apos;s requirement for the new type. In the present competitive state of theinternational airlines where speed of technical development is of such greatimportance it will generally be necessary to take the risk of ordering a productionbatch without the two to three years&apos; delay which is entailed in first provingthe prototype, and maybe further delay in gaining operational experience. Thusboth operator and constructor face a decision involving exceptional risks. large sums,]: probably running into several million pounds, are involved until the success* Our recommendations are in respect of large aircraft, i.e., in excess of 15,000 lb. It may still be possible for smaller aircraft to be designed, developed and marketed as private ventures,but with rare exceptions we think such aircraft are unlikely to be required by the corporations and they have been excluded from consideration in these notes.t Note the comments on this matter in B.S.A.A.O.&apos;s report for 1946-47. Whilst theycondemn the need for Ministry of Supply as an ordering agent they do not indicate whether theyare themselves prepared to accept the obligation and the burden of running their own projectsection.t Lockheed spent an estimated $27 million ( 6-75 million) to get the Constellation(100,000 lb. all-up weight) into production.

of the type is assured, and the essence of the problem is to define whereresponsibility shall lie. It will be said that, judged by ordinary commercialpractice in other industrial fields, the constructor must take the risk and standbehind his design. But projects on this scale, taking several years to mature,and involving probably the whole resources of the constructor, impose an intolerableburden and jeopardise the solvency of even the biggest company. Aerodynamicsis still a largely unexplored field, while the complexity of the aircraft and itsequipment grows with every step forward in performance and accretion of knowledge, making the design and manufacture of aircraft an enterprise involvingmore than the normal risk of failure.It follows that where considerations of urgency or prestige demand it, adecision to go ahead with production at an early stage can be taken only if theGovernment is a party.For the foregoing reasons it is the considered opinion of the great majority*of the Society&apos;s Members that at least for the next five years all aircraft requiredby the Airways Corporations should be ordered through the medium of theMinistry of Supply.It is, however, of the greatest importance to secure that the operatorsthemselves should be allowed sufficient independence in the preparation of theirspecifications and in the development of their aircraft, and should equipthemselves with sufficient technical strength to be able to determine their requirements reliably and effectively.* One Member of the Society taking an important part in the development of civil aircraftconsiders that reliance on the Ministry of Supply as a central buying agency would involve a dualtechnical control of the design, with consequent delays and frustrations, would dilute technical and financial responsibilities, and provide excuses for non-competitive results. But even thisMember envisages contracts for the development of experimental prototypes for civil purposesbeing placed by the Government, where these are too advanced to be relied on by an operator forrenewing his fleet.
