Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1948SECRET Copy no cp. (IS) 21130th A mgmsia IMSCABINETTHE DEVELOPMENT DIVISION OF THE BRITISH MIDDLE EASTOFFICEmsasoaikbtem bx the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my eoOeagnesmay recall that in CP. (45) 174 of 17th September, 1945, I putforward certain proposals for broadening the basis of British influence in theMiddle East by actively promoting the economic and social development of thearea as a whole. These proposals, which were approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on 4th October, 1945 (CM. (45) 38th Conclusions, Minute 6), included the attachment of a number of technical experts to the British Middle East office at Cairo, who would be available to advise the Middle East Governments on development questions.2. The Development Division of the British Middle East Office was set upin May, 1946, under the direction of Mr. W. F. Crawford, a retired senior officialfrom the Sudan Government. I now circulate herewith, for the information ofmy colleagues, a memorandum by Mr. Crawford describing the work which theDevelopment Division has carried out since that date.E. B.Foreign Omee.SQih Auaust. 1948.1M 31ANNEXMemorandum by Mr. W. F. CrawfordThough the Division was set up in May 1946, recruitment of the expert staff was not completed until March 1947. Those engaged were Sir Herbert Stewart(AgrienltnT-ej. Mr. Y. EL Maitland (Forestry), Dr. J. Murray (Statistics), Mr. R.G. Watearsion (Entomology), and Dr. A. B. Fowler (Animal Husbandry). Dr.Fowler has since resigned. Dr. Pridie (Health) and Mr. M. T. Audsley (Labour),who were already counsellors at the British Embassy, Cairo, were added to thestaff. En reading the following account of the division&apos;s activities it should beborne in mind that during the last winter, the most favourable season for work,movement oat of Egypt was prevented by cholera restrictions.An agricnlEaral survey is now practically complete for all Middle Eastcountries, except Ethiopia. Sir Herbert Stewards other activities were co-operation with the War Office Working Party in Libya, a tour of the northernSudan to advise on oil-seed and millet production, recommendations for theagrieultaral development of the Zayand-i-Rud irrigation scheme near Isphahanin Persia, a report on a proposal to grow ground nuts in the Lebanon for UnitedKingdom comsuEaptioH, and a 2,000 mile trip in the agricultural regions of Syria,indnding the Jazira, one of the potentially richest cereal production areas inthe Middle East. During 1947 he attended a conference at Bagdad on agri-cultural development in Iraq and has since then been in touch with the Ministryof Food on its production possibilities. He has also given much help in theTeernitnient of experts for the Iraqi Government.35818this docpmbst is the property of his  britannic  majesty&apos;s government
Dr. Fowler, (Animal Hnsbamdry). ha.s completed a survey of all territories,except Ethiopia and the Levant Stales. He also assisted the War Office working party in Libya, made a very notable tour of 10,000 miles in Persia (some of his recommendations have already been put into effect by the Persian Government),and helped the Iraqi Governnsent in the purchase of eggs and stock from theUnited Kingdom. He had teen approached, to lecture at the Fouad El Awwaluniversity in Cairo.  His zesjgmation is a great loss. ^Mr. Waterston has been frilly occupied with the campaign in Saudi Arabiaof the Middle East Jknia-Iaeosfc Unife. His relations with the Egyptian locustexperts who shared in this campaign have been noticeably cordial.A forestry survey of part off Persia and Iraq and of all the Levant states has been made by Mr. MaiHand. After a journey of some 3,000 miles in the caspian Sea area, he made, at the request- of the Persian Government, suggestions for the forestry section of the Seren-Year Plan. His visit to Cyprus along withthe directors of forests of Syria and the Lebanon was a remarkable success and,though the two countries may lack the means to carry out a large forestry pro-gramme, there is no doubt thai the Tfisit has done much good. He returned tothe Lebanon to help to start some small schemes.The work of Dr. Pridie has been concerned mostly with health problems inEgypt. He was deeply engaged ha the campaign against cholera. He has beeninstrumental in the recruitment of British personnel for the medical schools ofEgypt. (At the present lime mare British professors and lecturers are employedthan ever before). He has been of the greatest help in quarantine questions.He has also made a health survey of all Middle East countries, including theex-Italian colonies. At the request of the Syrian Government, he reported onthe Damascus medical school. He has done much to impress on the Iraqi Govern-ment the necessity for full-scale health measures against the diseases that maybe expected to follow large irrigation projects and as a result the Iraqi Govern-ment now propose to set up a Mlharzia institute. He also visited the TennesseeValley Authority and many of the important health research centres in theUnited States of America.Much of Mr. Audsley&apos;s work has been in Egypt. He was also of great assistance at the time of the labour troubles in Abadan in 1946, before the appoint-ment of a labour attache at Tehran He has visited the Sudan a number of times to advise on labour affairs and the drafting of trades union laws. He has alsopaid a number of visits to Iraq and the Levant States. Unfortunately, for reasons beyond his control he was forced to be absent in the United Kingdom fora considerable length of time.Dr. Murray has been fully occupied away from Cairo. He spent five months in Bagdad establishing a central statistical bureau and has since made returnvisits. It is gratifying to report that the bureau is making satisfactory progress.He spent over three months in Tehran at the same task for the Persian Govern-ment. Here he was widely consulted on many of the aspects of the Seven-year plan. He spent a month in Beirut assisting Professor Robson of the LondonSchool of Economies to draw up a plaoL for social insurance. Both the Syrian andthe Lebanese Governments have asked for him to set up central statisticalbureaux.Most of the experts have visited Cyprus and the Sudan, more to study localprojects than to advise. There are certain things in these countries which shouldbe of great value as object lessons to other less advanced states, e.g., the GaziraIrrigation Scheme in the Sudan and the forests and the co-operative system of cyprus. A start has already been made with a visit to the forests of Cyprus. Ithas not been possible to pay much attention outside health matters to the persian gulf.Certain of the experts attended as observers at the Regional Conference ofthe Food and Agriculture Organisation in Cairo in February this year. In spiteof the suspicion that the British Middle East Office has politico-economic aims and of the intransigence of the Iracp delegates, they were of great use in helping to draft the recommendations of the Conference.Continual contact has been kept with the Ministries of Health and Food inthe United Kingdom, with the forestry adviser to the Colonial Office and thedirector of the Anti-Loeust Research Centre.Relations with the technical attaches of the diplomatic missions of the UnitedStates of America have been close and cordial. It should be remembered thatthese latter do not compete with the Development Division as they do not haveadvisory functions.
Considerable help has been given to the Middle East Secretariat of theForeign Office in the engagement of British experts for Middle EastGovernments. The firm of Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners which has been engaged in economic surveys of the Lebanon and Syria have gratefullyacknowledged the assistance of the Division.In assessing the work done by the division, it must be borne in mind that allMiddle East countries were at the start excessively suspicious of the BritishMiddle East Office and the Development Division. It can now be truthfullysaid that much of this suspicion has been dissipated. That this is so in spite ofincreasing xenophobia and the Palestine question says much for the recognisedtechnical abilities and the personalities of the experts. It is impossible tooverrate the latter. Contacts and friendships made at technical levels are. doingmuch to keep British prestige alive. That more actual development and reformhas not been carried out in the Middle East is due to the instability of governments.The fact that the staff of the Development Division can and do make repeatedvisits is of the greatest value. Ad hoc visits by experts, no matter how highlyqualified, rarely give results. Also valuable is the fact that contacts are kept withtechnical staff who do not as a rule come into touch with the diplomatic missions.In many cases they are young men who will some day rise to positions ofresponsibility. It is of great advantage to have a body of experts who havegeneral knowledge of the Middle East and can act as a medium for the exchangeof information. The inclusion of personnel with Indian and Sudanese experience has proved most useful.Up to date most of the work has been in gaining the confidence of theGovernments concerned. During the next year the task will be to retain and strengthen the friendships made. Actual achievement will depend on how far thevarious States will be able to start their development schemes.In Persia the Government will want a great deal of help in putting into action what parts it can of the Seven-Year Plan. This applies especially toany attempt to develop by irrigation Khuziztan, where Indian and Sudaneseexperience will be most valuable. The central statistical bureau will needdirection. Further visits will be needed to get adopted the recommendations for Forestry and Animal Husbandry which have already been made.The amount of work to be done in Iraq depends a great deal on the settingup of the Central Planning Board. Even though this country should employ anumber of British experts, the wide experience of the Development Divisionstaff will be of great use to them. Much help is likely to be needed for labourlegislation. Further visits will be necessary for the establishment of the central statistical bureau.In Syria, it is hoped that greater progress will be possible in themechanisation of the Jazira wheat producing area. More advice and encouragement will be necessary for the Medical School, forestry and statistics.The same applies in the Lebanon to the latter two subjects and to social insurance.In both countries help will certainly be needed for labour legislation.Some assistance may be wanted in Transjordan for forests and pasturage.Little, except in health and labour matters, has been done in Egypt,principally because in agriculture and its cognate subjects it is much more advanced than other Middle East countries. It now seems that advice may besought in animal husbandry and forestry.The oil seed and mechanised millet production trials and any meat processingproject in the Sudan will be followed with great interest.Depending on the activities of the World Health Organisation, it seems that further advice may be sought by Ethiopia oh health matters. There are no signs that the Government wishes any other help.Labour difficulties will almost certainly need attention in the Persian Gulf.Lack of water seems to preclude any large scale agricultural or pastoraldevelopment.Once the Desert Locust Survey has been set up at Nairobi, the entomological^ expert will be called on to do liaison work with foreign countries in the desert*- locust outbreak area. It is also proposed that he should study the Moroccanlocust, which causes such havoc in the northern areas of the Middle East. He may also start a study of the Sunn pest in wheat.If Middle East countries are to be encouraged to adopt the co-operativesystem, it may be necessary to engage a co-operative expert. This is being discussed with the diplomatic missions concerned.The term of the engagement of experts is for three years only. Some of them have by now completed nearly half their time.   It is most important that the
present team, which is almost an ideal one, should be kept together. Too great stress cannot be laid on the value of personality. What the Middle East wantsas a general rule is not an expert in a certain line but someone who they knowis an expert and whom they like and are used to. Changes in the personnel ofthe team mean starting again. Further, it should be borne in mind that the personnel of the division spend most of their time in travel, and only those whoknow the conditions of the rural areas can realise how arduous are journeys likethose which have been made in Persia and Syria.The amount of development which has taken place in the Middle East isdisappointing. It is disquieting that this year no less than four countries havehad to call on world supplies for wheat. More food must be produced for the increasing populations. This delay in development has been due to political,economic and financial troubles and to the fact that no spade work in researchhas ever been done. It is not directly in the power of the Development division to set right or make amends for any of these causes. What the personnel of the division have accomplished is to get over the original mistrust, make friendson technical levels and have their advice asked for, so that, as development takes place, they will be in a position to play a prominent part. There is no doubt thatthey are proving a valuable adjunct to British diplomacy in the Middle East.
