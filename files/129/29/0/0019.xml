(48) 20927th August, 1948CABINETINTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCE, SAN FRANCISCO,JUNE /JULY 1948Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service. The 31st Session of the International Labour Conference was held at san Francisco from 17th June to 10th July. The Governing Body met on 9th June but had not completed its work when the Conference opened and had tohold a number of meetings during the Conference. A session of the newGoverning Body elected by the present Conference was held on 8th July.The conference. The Conference was opened by the Chairman of the Governing Body,Mr. Luis Alvarado, Peru. On the proposal of the United Kingdom DelegationMr. Justin Godart, France, was elected President by acclamation. The Vice-Presidents were Mr. Sumer, Turkey (Government), Mr. Oersted, Denmark(Employer), and Mr. Bengough, Canada (Worker). The Chairmanships of thevarious Committees were divided among delegates from different countries on ageographical basis, as far as was consistent with the efficient conduct of business.General3. The Conference was attended by 51 States, which sent altogether about450 delegates and advisers. The agenda was extremely important and very heavy in fact too heavy for the time allowed, three and a half weeks, and partof the work had to be deferred until the 1949 session. Nevertheless, as will beseen from the more detailed account given below, substantial progress was made-in a great many directions. More encouraging even than the actual groundcovered was the spirit of co-operation shown by almost all delegates. Inevitablysome delegates representing Governments, employers, and more particularly theextreme left wing of the workers, used the conference for propaganda purposes,and were unwilling to compromise even for the sake of getting workableConventions or Recommendations. But apart from these, who were in a verysmall minority, most delegates were prepared to co-operate in order to arriveat conclusions which were likely to be accepted and, even more important,implemented by the respective States Members of the Organisation.4. This is a welcome return to reality on the part of representatives atI.L.O. Conferences, who too often vote to put on paper Conventions andRecommendations which are too extreme to have much chance of being carriedout within the foreseeable future, and who indeed, in the case of some government delegates, more especially perhaps those from the Latin American countries,vote, for political reasons, for measures which they know quite well their governments have no intention whatsoever of carrying out. Moreover some ofthe Federal States, including the United States, are not guiltless of voting fora many Conventions which, owing to their federal constitutions, they are unableto ratify. Indeed the record of Conventions passed by the I.L.O. since about1930 makes a poor story, since very few of them have been even ratified,let alone implemented, by a significant number of States. It should be added thatGreat Britain has as good a record as any State in the matter of ratification.5.   As a result of the greater spirit of co-operation and the greater realismshown in the last two or three years, and especially this year, the measuresadopted have been of a kind which, while representing an advance on the existing35813 - B
law and practice in many States, should not be impossible of ratification andimplementation by most of the Member States of the Organisation.6. In achieving the result just mentioned the British Delegation Government Employers and Workers played a conspicious part. We are stilllooked to as the leaders in the I.L.O., and although quite clearly we cannot expect to get our own way all the time, very little was adopted by the Conference this year which is likely to prove unacceptable to the British Government. This is due in large part to the strong and highly qualified delegation which this year, as in previous years, the United Kingdom sent to the Conference and which has hadthe effect of maintaining the very high prestige which we hold in the Organisation.I have not the slightest hesitation in affirming that, although the temporaryloss of their services at home involves some sacrifice by the Department concerned,on a broad view it pays us handsomely to send to the International LabourConference representatives of seniority and experience who can speak with authority, and I wish to express my gratitude to those of my colleagues whospared some of their officers to take part in the proceedings at San Francisco.I must add an expression of my very great appreciation of the whole-hearted-operation of the employers&apos; and workers&apos; representatives, led respectively bySir John Forbes Watson and Mr. Alfred Roberts, who, without sacrificing anyof the principles which they were there to defend, went out of their Avay to supportBritish Government policy wherever they found this possible. Indeed it istrue to say that only in a few instances did the action of the British employer andworker representatives diverge from the line taken by the United KingdomGovernment delegates, and the successful outcome of the Conference from theBritish Government point of view owes much to their assistance.7. Of the various persons attending the Conference Mr. Justin Godart made an efficient and impartial President, although at times he was a little inclined torush things. Sir Godfrey Ince was by common consent an outstanding Chairmanof the Committee on Wages, and was largely responsible for the considerableamount of ground covered by that Committee. Mr. Thorn, the High Commissionerfor New Zealand in Canada, was Chairman of the very important Committeeon Freedom of. Association, and after a shaky start, when it appeared that he might prove too weak, became a most acceptable Chairman and, by his patienceand good humour, contributed to the remarkable result that this Committeeadopted a Convention this year and agreed on the first draft of a secondConvention for adoption next year without a single dissentient and this on a subject which hitherto has defied agreement at the international level. Of othersit is only necessary to mention Sir John Forbes Watson, who, with his long experience and great wisdom, with&apos;the prestige he enjoys both on personal grounds and as leader of the employers, and with his loyalty to the United Kingdom,was a tower of strength at all times, and Mr. Alfred Roberts, the British Workers&apos;delegate. This is Mr. Roberts&apos; first year as British Workers&apos; delegate in succession to Sir Joseph Hallsworth. He has been an adviser on previous occasionsand has always shown himself to be a sound and acceptable member of the delegation. This year he was undoubtedly the outstanding personality among theworkers&apos; representatives, not even excluding Mr. Leon Jouhaux. This Conferencecoincided with the triennial elections to the Governing Body when eight workermembers are chosen by all the workers&apos; delegates to the Conference. Theimpression which Mr. Roberts made upon his worker colleagues can be gaugedfrom the fact that in his first year as delegate he was elected by them to theGoverning Body at the head of the poll with a one hundred per cent. vote.Co-operation with Commonwealth Representatives8. Close contact was maintained throughout the Conference with delegatesand advisers from the Commonwealth countries. Our relations with thoserepresentatives were most friendly and, although we differed from some of them on certain detailed points of policy, they all showed the strongest desire to become-operative. This was particularly noticeable in the delegates from India and pakistan.The Minister of Labour&apos;s Address to the Conference9. I addressed the Conference at the opening of the discussion on theDirector-General&apos;s Report. The speech, which is attached at Annex I, fell into two main parts, the first dealing with the general economic position in the UnitedKingdom and the urgent need for greater production, especially of basic com-modities, throughout the world; the second dealt with the threat to freedom.
My colleagues will wish to know that, on going to the rostrum, I was given agreat ovation as an expression of the Conference^ appreciation at the presenceonce again of the British Minister of Labour. I am deeply indebted to the foreign secretary and to the Economic Section for their help in providing passages forthe speech which proved so acceptable to delegates and. received such warmcommendation from them.The Director-General10. This was the last Conference at which Mr. Edward Phelan was present as Director-General. After serving with the Organisation since its foundationhe retires at the end of August. 1948. Many and deserved tributes were paidduring the course of the Conference to the unique services rendered to the11^.0. by Mr. Phelan. A brilliant administrator, he was completely devotedto the Organisation.   He will be a great loss.11. To succeed Mr. Phelan as Director-General the Governing Body electedMr. David Morse, Under-Secretary for Labour in the United States Government.Credentials12. There were a number of challenges to the credentials of workers&apos; dele-gates, the most interesting of which concerned Mr. Jouhaux, France, and theIndian Workers&apos; Delegate. Mr. Jouhaux&apos;s credentials were challenged by theC.G.T., of which until the end of last year he was General Secretary, supportedby representatives of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Italy, on the ground that theconstitutional provision requiring appointment in agreement with the mostrepresentative organisation of workers had not been complied with. the credentials Committee consisting of Mr. Paal Berg, Norway (Government), Mr.Pons, Uruguay (Employer) and Mr. Paul Finet, Belgium (Worker) foundunanimously that there was not sufficient evidence to support the claim of theC.G.T. to be the most representative workers&apos; organisation in France and thattheir challenge to Mr. Jouhaux&apos;s appointment could not, therefore, be sustained.This finding was supported with great enthusiasm by the Conference in plenary session.13. The challenge to the Indian Workers&apos; Delegate, who is a member of thefairly recently formed Indian National T.U.C., came from the All India T.U.Cwhich has supplied the Indian Workers&apos; Delegate on many previous occasions andwhich claims to be the most representative Avorkers&apos; organisation in India. Inthis case, too (as indeed in all other cases) the Credentials Committee refused tosupport the challenge, but they were clearly not completely satisfied and expressedthe hope that in future the Indian Government would provide clearer evidence thatthey had fulfilled the constitutional requirements in making their appointment ofthe workers&apos; delegate.The Falkland Islands14. In the discussion in Plenary Session on the Report of the Committee onthe Application of Conventions and Recommendations, the principal government delegates from the Argentine expressed the reserve of his Government on that section of the report which related to the Falkland Islands. He stated that hisGovernment objected to the classification of those territories as non-metropolitan territories, that the Falkland Islands (Malvinos) were Argentine territory, thatshe must clearly assert her right thereto and that her sovereignty over the Islandscould not be restricted on any ground whatever. The telephonic interpretation of the speech did not come through clearly, but the United Kingdom government representative immediately reserved the right to make a reply if this should appearnecessary after seeing the transcript of what was actually said. When the tran-script became available there was no time to obtain definite instructions from homebefore the Conference closed on the following day, and it appeared wiser not to pursue the matter in the I.L.O. but that it should be taken up. if at all, throughother channels.Membership15. At the beginning of the proceedings the Conference was informed that since the preceding Session five States, Pakistan, Syria, Burma, the Philippinesand El Salvador, had become members of the Organisation under that provisionof the Constitution which permits any member of the United Nations to become a member of the I.L.O. on agreeing to accept the obligations of membership. In35813 &apos; b 2
addition Ceylon, although not yet a member of the United. Nations, was admitted to membership during the course of the Conference. On this occasion I took theopportunity of offering a suitable welcome on behalf of the British Government.The Agenda of the Conference16. I shall in due course be submitting to my colleagues proposals regardingthe action which we should take on the different conclusions of the Conference.In the meantime I append the following brief notes on the results of the discussions on the main items on the agenda.Finance17. The expenditure budget for 1949 was adopted at a net total of $5,185,539.This includes a supplementary estimate of $76,269 approved since the Govern-ing Body examined the estimates in March. The total represents a substantial increase (17 per cent.) on the original budget for 1948, but this is inevitable havingregard to the expanding work of the Organisation. Indeed, in view of the factthat the Organisation is still in process of rebuilding its staff to the pre-war strength, the I.L.O. can be congratulated on a budget of such reasonabledimensions. Moreover, the present figure represents a cut of over f400,000 onthe original estimate for 1949 presented to the Governing Body by the Director-General. In addition, although, as has been said, it shows an increase on thebudget for 1948, the contributions of Member States will not have to be increased in proportion, since there is a large surplus from 1947 which, under the FinancialRegulations, is used in reduction of contributions for 1949. This relief, of course,is not a recurring item, and Member States must expect a further rise in their contributions in 1950. A further measure of relief to some members, includingthe United Kingdom, results from the accession of new members and the increasein the number of units contributed by other members whose pre-war contributionhad been scaled down owing to their economic difficulties but who are now raisingtheir contributions towards the pre-war level. The number of units of contribu-tion for 1949 is 817 compared with 623 in 1947. The United kingdom contribution for 1949 will be just over $580,00 compared with just over$540,000 in 1948.Standing Orders18.   Under this item the Conference (1) confirmed proposals which had already been drawn up by the Governing-Body concerning the relationships between the I.L.O. and non-governmental organisations, such as the W.F.T.U.;(2) drew up standing orders for Regional Conferences; and(3) accepted the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of specialised agencies which had been adopted by the United Nations Assemblylast autumn, subject to two points :(a) an extension to the Assistant Directors-General of the fulldiplomatic status proposed for the Director-General, and(&amp;) an extension of certain immunities, such as inviolability of papers,for experts sent on missions.19. In connection with this latter Convention the United Kingdom Govern-ment representative reserved the position of his Government on certain privilegesrelating to communications such as press rates, &amp;c, which the United nations assembly had agreed should be given to the Specialised Agencies.Freedom of Association20.   The Conference-(1) adopted a Convention on Freedom of Association and the Right toOrganise;(2) agreed on the points to be included in a Convention or recommendation for adoption next year concerning the detailed application of the rightto organise;(3) adopted a resolution expressing the desire of the I.L.O. to collaborate with the United Nations in developing the international machineryfor supervising freedom of association and instructing the governing body to take this matter up with the competent organs of the united nations.All these results were achieved unanimously.
21. Certain other questions in the industrial relations field, such as con-ciliation and arbitration, collective agreements and co-operation between public authorities and employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations, were deferred until nextyear.I r:Wages22.   The Conference agreed (1) points for inclusion in a Convention and a Recommendation to be adoptednext year dealing with labour clauses in public contracts. Thesefollow the lines of our fair wages clause but go rather beyond its provisions. As at present contemplated the Convention and theRecommendation should be acceptable to this country:(2) points to be included in a Convention and a Recommendation to be adoptednext year on the protection of wages. These points deal largely with matters which are covered in Great Britain either by the Track Actsor by collective agreements. The points for inclusion in the convention are quite acceptable to us. The points for inclusion in the Recommenda-tion as at present drafted are to a very large extent unacceptable to us;(3) a Resolution on equal pay for men and women, urging various measureswith a view to the more widespread application of the principle of equal pay. In addition the Resolution invited the Governing body to place the subject on the agenda of the earliest possible Session ofthe Conference with a view to the adoption of internationalregulations;(4) a Resolution proposing certain measures with a view to promoting the wider application of the principle of a guaranteed week:(5) to continue in 1949 the consideration of the subject of wages, including those matters with which it had been unable to deal this year.Employment Service and Vocational Guidance23. One Committee dealt with both these subjects. On the recoimnendationof the Committee, the Conference (1) adopted a Convention and a Recommendation on Employment ServiceOrganisation. The Convention is completely acceptable to the UnitedKingdom and the Recommendation completely acceptable except inregard to one point;(2) agreed on points for inclusion in a Recommendation to be adopted nextyear on Vocational Guidance. This also in its present form is quiteacceptable to the United Kingdom;(3) as the result of a procedural tangle which the Committee got itself into,decided to defer till next year further consideration of the revisionof the Convention which provides for the abolition of fee-chargingemployment agencies.Night Work for Women and Young Persons24. Under this item the Conference had the task of examining and, where necessary, revising the old Conventions relating to night work of women and youngpersons. In certain respects these Conventions lacked flexibility and wereunsuited to the present economic situation in many countries which demands an expansion of the double day shift working system. Indeed as my colleagues are aware, for this very reason, we have recently given notice of denunciation of the oldConventions. Inevitably these Conventions as now revised have in some respectsbeen made tighter, but on the main issue, relating to the definition of the wordnight &apos;&apos; and the period during the night during which work is completelv barred,, they were made more flexible and to that extent will be much more satisfactoryv. from the point of view of the United Kingdom. In one respect the revised Con-vention relating to young persons may prove embarrassing, for it repealscompletely the provision in the earlier Convention which allowed young personsin certain circumstances to work in coal mines during the night. On this matter,however, the United Kingdom Government was in a minority of one in theCommittee which examined the old Convention, and it was felt&quot; to be impossibleto press in Plenary Session for the retention of this provision
Resolutions25. The Conference dealt with a number of miscellaneous resolutions ofwhich mention need only be made of two.(i) Japan26. The Conference passed a resolution inviting the Supreme Commander,Allied Powers, to send an observer delegation to the present Session of the Inter-national Labour Conference, and suggesting that the observer delegation shouldreflect the tripartite character of the Organisation. The resolution furtherrequested the Governing Body to consider the desirability of inviting the supreme commander, Allied Powers, to send similar observer delegations to future sessions of the Conference and industrial committees which are particularly concernedwith Japanese labour standards. This resolution was only agreed after longdiscussion in the Selection Committee and was not passed by the Conferenceuntil the last days of the Session. A reply was received from the supreme commander at the final sitting of the Session expressing appreciation of the invitation, stating that shortage of time made it impossible to accept the invitation to the present Session and. expressing the hope that the relation opened by the invitation would prove beneficial to all parties concerned.(ii) Domestic Service27. The other resolution that needs to be mentioned is one presented by theUnited Kingdom Workers&apos; Delegate relating to the status and employment of domestic workers. It was agreed to request the Governing Body to consider the advisability of placing this question on the agenda of an early Session of theConference, preferably in 1950.The Governing Body28. The only business of the Session of the Governing Body held immediately before the Conference which calls for mention is the election, which has alreadybeen referred to in paragraph 8 above, of Mr. David Morse as Director-Generalof the I.L.O.Election of a new Governing Body29. The triennial elections to the Governing Body took place at this conference. The Governing Body is composed of sixteen Government members,namely, the eight States of chief industrial importance and eight other Govern-ment members chosen by the States other than the eight States of chief industrialimportance; eight employer members elected by the whole body of the employers&apos;delegates to the Conference; and eight worker members similarly elected by thewhole body of workers&apos; delegates to the Conference. There was a change this year in the eight States of chief industrial importance, Brazil taking the place of theNetherlands. After much examination there was considerable doubt which state should occupy the eighth place in this category, and a further examination hasto be made. In the meantime Belgium continues to occupy the eighth place.Among the elected members it is significant that Poland was re-elected despitea strong campaign by Portugal to obtain election. There was much symapathy for Portugal, which has never been on the Governing Body, but the majority of governments felt that an Eastern European country should remain on theGoverning Body so as to preserve a link between the I.L.O. and Eastern Europe.,and in the final ballot Poland obtained 35 votes to Portugal&apos;s 29.30. The full list of members of the new Governing Body is given in Annex II.A significant feature is that the workers did not elect a single member who was suspected of having Communist sympathies. For example, Australia this vearsent to the Conference as workers&apos; delegate a man who is regarded as a Communist.Despite this the Workers&apos; Group in the Conference re-elected to the governing body Mr. Albert Monk, one of the soundest trade union leaders in Australia, whohas represented the Australian workers in the I.L.O. for a number of vears, but who this year was not sent as their rejoresentative.31. The business transacted at the session of the new Governing Body heldon 8th July calls for no special comment.Ministry of Labour and National Service S W 127th Auaust, 1948.G. A. I.
ANNEX IExtract from the Provisional Record, International Labour Conference,24th June, 1948,Mr. ISAACS (Government delegate, United Kingdom) I am especiallyglad of the chance of addressing the Conference this year because I feel it is a significant year in the history of the International Labour Organisation.Two events make it so. In the first place, the revised Constitution has comeinto force. That Constitution formed the subject of prolonged consideration andexhaustive debate. It was designed both to meet that wider conception of theInternational Labour Organisation^ place which experience has brought, and toenable the Organisation to face up to its greater responsibilities in the post-war world. It received the unanimous consent of the Conference at Montreal in 1946.With its coming into force the International Labour Organisation stands securelyin the structure of present-day international organisations, strongly based on thefull and freely accorded consent of its Members.In the second place, the Governing Body has elected a new Director-General,draw from the public service of the great nation on whose territory we are meeting to-day. The International Labour Organisation, with these two things achieved,now faces the future, and in the present state of international relations it is not an easy future.I should like to pause for a moment to say a word about the position of theDirector-General in this Organisation, and the great importance which my government attaches to it. I cannot fail to express the appreciation of my government, and my own personal appreciation and admiration, for the verygreat services which the retiring Director-General, Mr. Edward Phelan, has given both to the International Labour Organisation from its very beginning,and to the cause of peace and social justice throughout the world.He participated in the discussions in Paris in 1919 which resulted in theestablishment of this Organisation. He had a large part in drafting its constitution; he was, in part, himself responsible for it. He joined theOrganisation when it was set up, and has been with it ever since. In 1941 he assumed the Acting Directorship, and in 1946 he achieved his life-long ambitionwhen the Governing Body unanimously confirmed his appointment as Director-General with retroactive effect from the date in 1941 on which he becameAc-ting Director. During the nearly thirty years that he has served theOrganisation he has tended and nurtured it. He has brought to it absoluteloyalty, a brilliant and fertile mind, gifts of exposition and administration whichare unsurpassed. He is without doubt one of the outstanding internationaladministrators of our time. To him more than to any other single man is due thefact that this Organisation remained in being as an active force during the warand at the war&apos;s end was ready and equipped to resume its onward march.The Organisation all of us owe him a debt which only history will be able toestimate properly.I greet the future holder of the post, Mr. David Morse, confident that he, too,will uphold the tradition established by his predecessors. We have come to expect in the Director-General of the International Labour Organisation a.wisdom and an authority which is seldom found in international politics. Wehave in the past had faith in our Directors and have supported their authority,and I give Mr. Morse the most complete assurance that we shall continue to do soin the future. The high reputation of this Organisation is very dear to us.The upholding of it rests in large measure with the Director-General, and I nowassure him that he can rest confident that we will do all in our power to aidhim in that task.The Report before us shows how urgent and vital is the need for international co--operation in all directions, and particularly in the economic sphere. The storywhich it records is not one which can give us any excuse for jubilation, but none the less I am happy to see from it that there are hopes of better things in almost all countries.I should like to say something about the action of my own Government on some of the problems to which the Director-General has drawn attention. Hehas emphasised first the dangers of inflation and the threat which this conditionbrings to the well-being of workers in every country. The Government of theUnited Kingdom fully recognises these dangers and it has taken vigorous actionagainst them. In view of the inflationary situation which was snowing signsof developing, my Government issued in February of this year a statement of
policy, in a White Paper entitled &quot; Statement on Personal Incomes, Costs and prices,&quot; which declared, in a passage quoted by the Director-General in his report, that &quot; until more goods and services are available for the home market,there is no justification for any general increase of industrial money incomes.&quot;It went on to state that &quot; experience has shown that, when it comes to a racebetween rising prices and rising personal incomes, prices will always win inthe long run so that conditions become progressively worse for the holders of allpersonal incomes, but particularly for wage earners.&quot; The statement wenton to express the views that there is no justification for a further rise in profits and dividends, that prices should come down, and that there is no presentjustification for a further general rise in wages, and that sectional increases should only be made on the basis of certain criteria which were set out.That is a statement of our Governments views on this very important question. I want to draw the attention of this Conference, however, to thesignificant fact that this statement was then accepted and endorsed by the &quot;Trades Union Congress, which represents the overwhelming mass of organisedworkers in my country, and by the British Employers&apos; Confederation and theFederation of British Industries, which represent the employers. This responsehas been remarkable, and gives good ground for hoping that there will be areasonable measure of stability in the wage and price structure of my country.It does not mean that there will be no changes, but it does mean that we can properly anticipate that necessary adjustments will take place in an orderlyfashion and without recourse to widespread industrial strife on the one hand,or a runaway general inflation on the other.&quot;Wage and price levels, however, are only the symptoms of deeper influencesin the economy of a country. Neither voluntary agreement nor compulsory govern-ment control can be effective if financial and investment policies are not fitted tothe needs of the situation. My Government has recognised that some long-term requirements must be sacrificed if we are to get over our immediate difficulties,and it has, therefore, undertaken a vigorous reduction in public investment.This has not been an easy decision to take. It has meant giving up plans for new schools and new houses; but we have decided that it must be done. My Govern-ment has further in its annual budget calculated on a surplus that is to say, areduction of the spending power in the hands of the public of over 300 millionpounds. That again is not entirely a popular thing to do, but this also hasreceived general acceptance, and has given new proof of the way in which all sections of my country are pulling together for the common good and ultimateeconomic recovery, even if this means facing additional hardships here and now.I do not want to leave you with the impression that the United kingdom to-day is a grim place, with everyone doing nothing but tightening their belts,paying taxes and accepting restrictions. It is far from that. It is a hive ofindustry. Steel output, for example, normally one of the main indices of a country&apos;s industrial production, is at the highest level in our history. Coal pro-duction, though not, it is true, up to pre-war levels, has risen substantially in thepast fifteen months. The production of tractors to mention one item whoseimportance is specially stressed in the Director-General&apos;s Report, is up 200 percent, compared with 1939. In fact, our total industrial production to-day is aboveour pre-war production. Furthermore, we are planning to increase our agricul-tural production by 20 per cent, over the next four years as our contribution tothe world shortage of food.This increased production is helping us to overcome our present economic diffi-cuities. difficulties which have arisen from devastation and dislocation caused bythe war. The United Kingdom, having over-exerted herself during the war, has since been suffering from the pains and stresses arising from that mighty effort.But we are now regaining our strength, and, given time, we shall by our own efforts,by our own hard work, restore our economic position and maintain our economicindependence.Here I would like to mention that my country since 1945 has been responsiblenot only for the policy of its own territory but, in common with its Allies, also for germany. My Government wishes to see German production of essential peace-time commodities built up to help to supply the needs of Western Europe. At thesame time, in common with our Allies, we want to ensure that that production shallnot be of such a kind and volume as will enable Germany again to inflict thetragedy of war upon Europe and the world; and we are determined that controlof Germany&apos;s production shall never pass again into the hands of those who arethe enemies of democracy and of liberty. Germany was once a Member of theInternational Labour Organisation.   We all hope that she will again become a
Member in due course. In the meantime, I should like to say that I welcome theinterest which I believe is now being shown by the Office in German problems,because I believe that the kind of society to which this Organisation is dedicatedand which its influence will foster will be a guarantee against a resurgence ofthat fanatical and authoritarian spirit which we have fought against so bitterlyand at such cost.The Director-General in his Report has placed a very grave emphasis on one problem, the shortage of vital commodities. He is right to do so, because thisis a problem which can only be solved by concerted international action. the pattern of the world&apos;s supply of food, for example, has been so gravely distortedby the dislocation of war and the political difficulties which have followed war that it can never be righted by the mechanism of trade alone! For man must notonly eat, he must also work, and the materials for work are not in every case avail-able in the quantities in which they are needed. There are grave and dangerousshortages of many materials which are essential to a high and stable level ofindustrial employment; to the successful execution of urgent schemes of recon-struction&apos;and development; and, of course, to the production of those commodities fertilisers, agricultural machinery and so on upon which we rely in part to solve the pressing problem of food output. Some increases in particular commodities may be expected in the near future. The repair of war-damagedmining facilities, for example, may raise tin output. The greater availability of coal may reduce the need to use timber as fuel and so increase the supply ofwood and pulp; but we shall not be able to take advantage of this without real and full co-operation in the international sphere and through the international agencies. The labours of this Conference may be in vain if this other problem isnot solved, and I therefore most earnestly commend to you the need for full recognition of our responsibilities here.There is another shortage which is more especially the concern of the Inter-national Labour Organisation that of manpower. This is basic to the whole problem of production, and the present shortage of manpower, coupled with amaldistribution of available manpower, is a serious threat to vital production andso to world economic recovery. My own country has taken several constructivesteps to deal with this problem in the United Kingdom. In the first place we have endeavoured to retain or to bring back into industry those marginal workers especially women and older peoples who took up employment during the war.With great reluctance, and on a purely temporary basis, we have reimposed somemeasures of labour control in order to ensure that workers-stay at or go intoessential work, and that everyone who can takes part in the national effort.We have undertaken large schemes for the recruitment of foreign workers.I think that I can claim that the United Kingdom to date has accepted a greater number of these workers than any other country, and has thus also made thegreatest contribution towards, the solution of the problems of persons displacedfrom their country by the war. In addition to the large number of foreign workers who come to us for temporary employment, we have in the last twelve monthsresettled in the United Kingdom well over 120,000 displaced workers from various countries in Europe.Finally, we are experimenting with the grant of civilian status to german prisoners-of-war who have been working in England, especially in agriculture, andwho have expressed a wish to remain in my country after the return of the main body of their companions to Germany.While we in the United Kingdom have been working out our own contributionto this problem, I recognise that the exchange of workers between countries is inmore normal times pre-eminently a matter for international action and regulation,and for the International Labour Organisation in particular. I therefore welcomeboth the attention which has been paid by the Organisation to the internationalregulations governing migration, and the recent decision of the Governing Body,taken on proposals submitted by the Rome Manpower Conference, and by theEconomic Commission for Europe, to establish a Manpower Committee which willtackle the shorter term problems of surpluses and deficits of manpower andespecially skilled manpower in Europe, including problems of training andretraining. My Government has shown its good will towards this new venture in apractical fashion by the immediate loan of a number of experts; and the Confer-ence can rest assured that we shall continue to give it our full support.I turn for a moment to the problems which confront us here in San Francisco.It is seldom that any Conference can have had before it so important an agenda.Freedom of association, wages, the organisation of the employment service,vocational guidance, are all burning questions at. the present time.   It would be35813 c
idle to deny that some of these subjects raise difficult and controversial questions.Possibly we may not be able to solve them all completely, but the eyes of the worldare upon us as we consider these matters, and the world-both individuals and organisations is expecting us to make solid progress. We cannot afford not tomake progress. We can make progress even on these difficult questions if we set to work, in a spirit of give and take, to justify the faith of those who foundedthis Organisation, not on the basis of governmental representation only, but on a tripartite basis. Those men believed that the key to progress is to be found inco-operation, and it is on the question of co-operation that I would dwell for afew minutes.It is three years almost to a day since the Charter of the United Nations was signed in this city. The statesmen of fifty nations left here with high hopes, andthey carried these hopes back with them to the peoples of the world. They had created an organisation with tremendous potentialities for good, but they knew that everything now depended upon the will of the individual nations to work together within the new organisation in the spirit of co-operation, of democracyand of the tolerance which the Charter proclaimed.The representatives of the International Labour Organisation left san francisco sharing these high hopes to the full. Too often, in the years between thewars, we had seen our efforts to work for social j ustice made ineffective through thefailure of the nations to work together in the political and economic fields. Inthe birth of the new organisation, designed to secure that collaboration betweenthe nations in virtually all fields of human effort, we saw new possibilities ofadvancement opening out before mankind. In these the International LabourOrganisation would fully share, making a contribution which would be the more effective because of the new and powerful framework of international organisa-tions within which the International Labour Organisation was to operate.It would be idle to deny that the three years which have passed have failedto bring fulfilment of most of our high hopes. The impressive machinery of theUnited Nations has been set up, and it has worthy achievements to its credit, but the will to use it in the true spirit of the Charter has been lacking on the part ofsome who are possessed of great power and resources, whether for good or evil.But we in the United Kingdom, while we confess to our disappointments,affirm that, in spite of them, we retain our faith in the Charter which we signedand our high hopes for the organisation which we helped to create. It is, I think,especially fitting that I should make that affirmation in this place and at this time.We retain our faith in the fundamental freedoms on which the Charter isbased, and the International Labour Organisation itself rests upon these samebasic conceptions of freedom, the same ardent faith in the value and the rights ofthe individual. That faith found expression nearly thirty years ago in the Consti-tution of the International Labour Organisation, which gave full rights not onlyto Governments, but to the representative organisations of workers and employers.The International Labour Organisation rests upon the solid democratic belief that governments are not the repositories of all wisdom, and that States are not theonly human groupings in which sole power and authority should reside. I speakas a member of a Government and am fully conscious; therefore, of the claims which the Governments can rightly make, and the special place which they musthold within this Organisation. But I grew up in the free trade union movementof my country. I know what that movement has contributed to the developmentof British democracy; I know how much this Organisation stands tc gain fromthe growth of free institutions within its Member States. The InternationalLabour Organisation as we know it could not exist in a world where trade unions were simply part of the State machine, instruments designed solely tc make sure that the worker in field or factory knows what the State demands of him andresponds to the demand in the way which the States requires.The International Labour Organisation rests also on the solid democraticbelief in the ultimate force of informed public opinion. And by informed I meanfreely, widely and liberally informed. Conventions become effective becausethrough democratic processes, where there is free thought, a free press and freepublic discussion, the will of those affected by the Convention can ultimately bebrought to bear. The International Labour Organisation as we know it could not exist in a world where thought is bounded by one political or economic creed,where the press exists only to promulgate that creed, and where the will of the majority is completely determined and controlled by the leaders of the onepolitical party which the creed allows.
We are specially concerned at jthis Conference with freedom of association,the aspect of freedom which is of the greatest moment to the International LabourOrganisation and one with which, by our traditions and our Constitution, we arepre-eminently suited to deal. Last year we laid the basis^for a notable advance,and it is&apos; the profound hope of my Government that when this Conference endswe shall have adopted a Convention embodying the fundamental principles onwhich freedom of association must rest. This task has come to us on the initiative of the United Nations; it forms an essential part of the wider task of establishingfundamental human rights and freedoms, on which the United Nations is itselfengaged.The work done last year and the International Labour Organisation^approach to the subject have been attacked in some quarters, because the resolutions which were adopted recognised that organisations of employers have rights, no less than workers&apos; organisations. That criticism strikes a queer note to democraticears. British trade unionists will, I am sure, stand second to none in their in-sistence on trade union rights. They struggled to secure them for 150 years. Butin democratic countries men do not believe that their own rights and freedoms arethe better safeguarded by denying them to others. They do not think of the rights which are implied in freedom of association as being the exclusive possession ofany one group or type of organisation. They know that the freedom of theindividual, and of the organisation which individuals create, does not grow inthat way. I would therefore repeat that the approach which the InternationalLabour Organisation has made is the right approach, the only approach for thosewho understand social and industrial democracy, and that it will have the full support of the United Kingdom.But, while pressing on with our work for a Convention here and now wecan never forget that freedom will not exist in a world of economic collapse. Ihave already referred to the need for international co-operation in the economic sphere. Unless we have established the conditions in which countries can standagain on their own feet and have some assured hope of economic stability, wecan talk of freedom and inscribe it in our Charter or Conventions, but we shallnot get it. It is idle to believe that human rights or individual liberties willthrive in countries where famine threatens or civil war rages. That is why weall have a tremendous stake in the success of the recovery programme which theUnited States of America has so wisely and generously launched in co-operationwith the participating countries.Those who appear to have an interest in staving off recovery and economic stability like to represent the programme as one for the enslavement of Europeby what they like to call dollar imperialism. Their aim is to persuade the workers of the countries concerned that their essential interests are being sacrificed toprovide bigger and better markets for the United States of America. If theworkers could be so pursuaded, the recovery plan would be effectively sabotaged,even if the Governments could not be forced to withdraw. The workers of most ofthe countries concerned have given their answer. The great majority of the tradeunion organisations have come together in support of the Marshall Plan and have announced their intention of co-operating to bring it to success. They have donethis in a way which demonstrates what they mean and understand by democracy.They have not done it because their Government told them to do it; and still lessbecause a foreign Government told them to do it. They have not done it at thedictate of any political party. They have done it because they have examined the Plan freely within their own organisations, and have come freely to the con-clusion that it was calculated to promote the economic health of Europe, and notits economic exploitation or its political domination. So they have decided, inthe trade union way, to join together with their fellow workers in its support.That is a good example of the way the democratic process works. It is odd thattalk of compulsion and enslavement should have come from those who forced someof their neighbours to withdraw from the Plan against their manifest desire andtheir obvious interests.The International Labour Organisation will no doubt have its part to play in this great venture. It has already undertaken certain definite tasks in the man-power field designed to facilitate the movement of labour in the interests of theprogramme and of increased production. I have already expressed the hope thatit will press on with these tasks as a matter of urgency. What more the Inter-national Labour Organisation may be called upon to do to further the work of recovery cannot yet be precisely foreseen. I am sure that whatever it can andmay properly undertake, it will do in full co-operation with the other organisations
concerned, recognising that there is no immediate issue in which success or failurecan mean so much for the ultimate attainment of social justice and the promotion of human welfare throughout the world.Our Organisations has weathered many storms under the guidance of devotedpilots. Now under a new pilot we go ahead to our destination, aye, .to our destiny.The journey may be difficult, but with faith in our cause and confidence in our purpose we shall succeed, and future generations will be happier for our efforts.ANNEX IIComposition of Governinc Body of I.L.O., Juxy, 1948A.
