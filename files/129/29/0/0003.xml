this  document  is   the property of  his  britannic   majestys  governmentCONFIDENTIALTHE EUROPEAN recovery PROGRAMMEINFORMATION policy. There are five or more principal audiences for speeches and publicity fromBritish sources about the European Recovery Programme. They are the publicsat home, in North and South America, in Western Europe, the Dominions, andthe Colonies. The main objective of publicity must be the home public, whoseproper instruction is the condition of success for the whole programme. But whatis said at home has a powerful impact upon every audience overseas, and should bSframed with that fact continually in mind. Moreover, speeches, broadcasts andother publicity directed specifically to any audience is certain, if it has anygeneral interest, to become known elsewhere. There is therefore need forconsistency between all Ministerial and official statements, wherever directed.2. During the period of the European Recovery Programme Britain is committed to a policy of co-operation in economic affairs which may involve considerable co-ordination of her economy with that of Western Europe. such measures would provide perhaps the principal material for publicity. They willbe of great interest not only to the home public, but from various points of viewto the Americans, the British overseas, and the Europeans. This matter, among others, is touched upon in the following paragraphs.The Home Public3. A good deal of general instruction is still needed about the nature and purpose of the Programme, the organisations through which it wall work, andthe effect of it on our balance of payments problem. Its nature as a means torecovery rather than to relaxation needs hammering home until the public comesnaturally to think of the four-year period as a limited opportunity which mustbe exploited fully while it lasts or else be lost, perhaps finally.Our aim is to maintain our reserves during this period. This is necessary sothat we shall emerge at the end of the period with our full financial strength. Wemust use the aid we get in order to bring about our full recovery, so that at theend of the period we stand on our own feet, independent of assistance from abroad.We do not yet know how much aid we shall get in the first year of theProgramme. This will be determined following discussions which will take placein Paris during the next few weeks. The amount put down for us in the &quot; BrownBooks &quot; submitted by the United States Administration to Congress was  330millions for the year AprilT948 to March 1949, but we cannot yet say whether weshall get this amount, or more or less than it. In any case, with aid on this scale,an improvement in our general consumption levels is out of the question, and indeed further cuts may be needed.4. We are unlikely to receive from the United States exactly what we would wish for in the way of raw materials and other supplies, and we may be underpressure to accept less essential goods because the United States Government needs to dispose of agricultural surpluses. Such a situation may easily give rise to criticism at home or among other suppliers like the Dominions. The time may come when Ministers have to give a lead to home opinion by explaining difficultiesof this kind and encouraging understanding of United States needs and motives.5. The Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer have warned the Cabinet (CP. (48) 75) that &quot; Changes of a radical nature in our industrial and agricultural structure may become necessary to secure the economic inde-pendence of the Western European countries as a whole and to use our collectiveresources to the best advantage.&quot; The consequences that may follow from far-reaching co-operation with Western Europe must be explained systematically andwith great care.It will not do merely to explain, when they fall due, unpleasant or painfulmeasures taken in the wider interest of European union. The ground must beprepared; the canons which people use to judge such measures must be changed;and when specific explanations are needed, they must be comprehensive Dandpersistent.35678
It may need to be said that some industries are quite literally kept going only by receiving materials to work upon which are paid for by the United States andthat if other industries are restricted and some Avorkers ma,de to seek other work, itis because we are engaged in a common effort which will benefit all in the long runor even the fairly short run if we go the right way about it.6. Some aspects of the European Recovery Programme will be distasteful;but there is one feature of it which can help to put the rest in better perspective.This is the special and crucial responsibility which will rest upon Great Britain,and the unique degree in which the success of the whole programme of recoverywill depend upon the United Kingdom.(a) The United Kingdom will play the lead among the European countries,and given reasonable tact and restraint, there is no reason to suppose that they will mind acknowledging the fact.(&amp;) As the chief Colonial power, it will equally bear a heavy responsibilityfor developing the co-operation of the &quot; Overseas dependent territories &quot; in the interests of the territories themselves and theirinhabitants, as well as in the interests of the peoples of Europe.(c) Its successful performance of the liaison role between Europe and theDominions is a condition of the achievement of the whole programme.(d) For all the obvious reasons, including its own acceptance of the largestshare of aid, it bears a special responsibility to the United States forthe success of the enterprise.All this can be made to appeal to the British people&apos;s imagination and sense of mission. This sense of mission, which was amply gratified during the war,has been a little starved of late. Here is an opportunity to give it play again.The subject needs handling tactfully, with an eye to the susceptibilities of others.But if it is done in the right way, the effect should be good and useful at home aswell as abroad.The Dominions7. It must be borne in mind, however, that while publicity for the progressof the economic co-operation of the United Kingdom with Western Europe islikely to gratify European and United States opinion, it is likely to have the opposite effect in some of the Dominions, especially Australia and New Zealand.Many but not all sections of opinion in the British Commonwealth areconcerned at the United Kingdom&apos;s growing contact with Europe, politically asweakening the Commonwealth tie and as involving onerous commitments outof harmony with the Dominions&apos; own interests, economically because they fear thatit may lead to the diversion to Europe of United Kingdom exports (particularlycapital goods) which would otherwise have gone to them and to the loss of theirown markets in the United Kingdom and possibly also of the elimination or reduction of the preferences they receive here. The Australian and NewZealand Governments have already shown concern at the possible effects of these developments on them.The best way of allaying their fears would be to rub home the consideration that any economic or political strengthening of Europe is a strengthening of theUnited Kingdom and so even if not always directly a stregthening of theCommonwealth. It is important to emphasise that European economic co-operation and Western Union are not an alternative to the Commonwealthrelationship, but can strengthen it, and in their turn be strengthened by it. Inthis context stress should be laid upon the hard-headed and practical natureof our approach to the subject of Western Union. The Dominions stand to gain by the economic restoration of the United Kingdom as a market for their goods and as a source of capital. They also stand to gain from the restoration of western Europe. Any sacrifices that in the event have to be made (such as thepossible diversion to Europe of United Kingdom exports of capital goods, or theimportation from Europe of goods which might affect the volume of our importsfrom, say, Canada) must be accepted as necessary sacrifices, investments as itwere, made to ensure a greater return in the future.When referring to United States help it will be important to avoid givingthe impression that the United Kingdom can afford to ignore the help towardsrecovery she receives and has received from the Dominions : the Canadian credit,the Australian and New Zealand food contracts, the South African gold loanand the enormous numbers of food parcels received from the Dominions, allrepresent in different ways substantial contributions from the commonwealth and should not be overlooked.
The Colonies8. There is already considerable talk in the Colonies of &quot; exploitation &quot;of the colonial peoples in order to help Britain out of her difficulties. Theco-operation of Powers with colonial responsibilities in Paris gives colour to russian propaganda that the effect of O.E.E.C/s operations will be the more efficient exploitation of colonial resources for the sole benefit of Europe. Thisbelief will be strengthened as negotiations under Article V of the bilateralEconomic Co-operation Agreement for increasing production in colonial areasget under way unless the greatest care is taken to prove to the colonial peoplesthat any increase in their production is in their own interests and is not solelydesigned to enable the United Kingdom to meet its obligations under theProgramme. Most British colonies have already acceded to the economic co-operation Agreement under Article XII and others may well shortly do so.Positive action will then be needed to explain to the colonial peoples themselvestheir true position in the Programme and the benefits which will accrue to them,even though indirectly.The United States9. The bilateral agreement imposes on us a specific obligation to givepublicity to the benefits received under the European Recovery Programme. Itis to be publicity mainly to the home public, but it will be listened for in America.10. We should in the first place say &quot;thank you&quot; now and again. TheAmerican contribution to solving our economic difficulties is powerful and essential. At the same time, and particularly with the second year&apos;s appropriationin mind, we should show that, although the first year&apos;s work is ground workand although the general picture may well be one of effort rather than ofspectacular results, there will indeed be real achievements to show.There should be no attempt to direct a publicity campaign towards the UnitedStates. (This is in accord with the United States Administration^ wish.)But we must be ready to receive American inquirers and answer their questions and to provide ammunition for the Administration and for those in the UnitedStates who fight our battle for us. Americans will be impressed by the evidencethat the British understand their special responsibilities towards Europe listed in paragraph 6. And where there is effort to show, individual industries and particular sections of trade, as well as the economic system as a whole, can bemade the subject of useful platform reports.Western Europe11. This is where publicity about the British sense of responsibility has oneof its most practical contributions to make. In spite of all the evidence of whichwe ourselves are well aware, there is a strong feeling in Western Europe that weare not serious in support of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation. This takes two forms : that we are half-hearted about our contributionto Western Europe&apos;s recovery, and that we work more enthusiastically with theCommonwealth. (This latter is the counterpart of the Commonwealths feelingsmentioned in paragraph 7 above.) We should insist at every reasonable oppor-tunity on our support for the Organisation, and should let it be known in ministerial speeches and in every other way possible that we believe in its workand its future. When we do things, often at the expense of our own immediateinterests, to help European recovery, we are entitled to let it be known and itwill help the European Recovery Programme if we do. European audiences find themselves among unfamiliar conceptions when the talk is of co-ordinatingnational economies. By precept based upon example, we can help to make theseessential ideas more familiar.12. There is one topic worthy of separate mention. The United kingdom is entering upon a close relationship with the countries of Western Europe, aswell as maintaining its close partnership with the countries of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations. It is not yet clear what economic and other implications-tions this may have and, as Dominion opinion is sensitive on the subject, it is extremely important not to deal with it publicly, even for the benefit of Europe,until there has been an opportunity to clarify matters in discussion with theDominions. Later on, however, the existence and the point of view of theDominions will be a factor of which Europe will be made aware, and of whichit must take account. There will, therefore, be greater practical need thanformerly and a better opportunity to give Europe some idea of the political
characteristics and attitudes of the Commonwealth as well as of its economicsignificance to them and to the world. There is much in the older partnershipwhich is bound to become of greater interest to Europe, and in practice it must-fall to the United Kingdom to perform the task of interpretation.13. The foregoing paragraphs do not attempt to touch upon a number of specific problems which can be foreseen. Publicity may need to be used in supportof particular developments of policy, and there will always be the need to ensurethat answers to criticism and misunderstanding abroad are rapidly provided.These are matters for individual Ministers, or for ad, hoc Ministerial discussion as problems arise, and for suitable planning and executive action by the official information services.14. The Organisation for European Economic Co-operation itself hasresponsibilities and facilities for publicising its work. We should see that ourown information policy is co-ordinated to the greatest possible extent with thatof O.E.E.C. itself in Paris and of the participating countries in their respectivecapitals.30th July, 1948.
