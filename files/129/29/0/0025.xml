ANNEX IC* Draft Prorogation Speech, 19U7/U-8 session my LORDS AND MEMBERS OP THE HOUSE OP commons . During the Session which is now ending economic difficulties have gravely delayed the recovery of aid thecountries of the eastern hemisphere.      Through the sustained,energies of My people in achieving a great and continuingexpansion of exports and their resolute acceptance of a prolonged period of inevitable difficulty progress has &quot;beenmade in redressing the adverse balance of payments:   butworld circumstances have proved unfavourable,  and further effort and sacrifice will be needed if the problem is to be surmounted.      A great contribution towards lessening oue independence on imports has been made by our agricultural industry, all sections of which have responded to the call for increased production.      In the face of world shortagesMy Ministers have vigorously sought both to establish new sources of supply of foodstuffs and to safeguard the futureby entering into long-term agreements with overseas countries.2. The way before us is still hard, and it is only ^jithcourage and endurance, and by intensifying our present efforts,that we can,  under God,  overcome our difficulties and attainto that degree of prosperity and well-being for which we siihope.3. In these anxious times we have all been encouraged by thefar-sighted and generous action of the United States of Americain extending financial assistance to the United Kingdom andother European countries.&apos;    It is the policy of My Governmentto work with the Government of the United States and with other european Governments to bring about the fullest possible if 4&quot;-1-
measure of European recovery by the wise use both of our own resources and of the aid afforded us.      To this end they have entered into the Convention .for European Economic Co-operation,and have signed the Economic Co-operation Agreement with theUnited States.h. Close links have been forged with our neighbours in western Europe.      A Treaty of Economic, Social and CulturalCollaboration and Collective Self-Defence has been signed withthe Governments of Belgium, Prance, Luxembourg and theNetherlands;    permanent machinery for the co-ordination ofdefence with those countries has been established;    and satisfactory progress is being made with the other matters dealt with in the Treaty.      It is My prayer that out of thesehopeful beginnings there will develop an increasing degree of union between all the countries of Western Europe;    and thatultimately, in furtherance of the aims of the United Nations,they may, with their common heritage of culture and freedom,constitute an area of peace,  prosperity and ordered progress,in association with the peoples of My Commonwealth overseas andwith the United States of America.5. My Government, together &quot;with the United States andFrench Governments and in co-operation with the heads of theGovernments of the German States, have taken political,economic and financial measures to enable West em . Germany toplay her part in the community of European nations.     my government are still doing their utmost to reach agreement withthe Soviet Union on fundamental problems affecting germany as a whole.6. My beloved daughter, Princess Elizabeth, togetherwith the Duke of Edinburgh,  paid an official visit to theFrench Republic in May.      The affectionate reception which
-    174they were accorded formed a heartening demonstration of our good relations with our nearest Continental neighbour.7, I have been happy to welcome to the United Kingdomthe Prime Minister of Australia.      My Ministers in theUnited Kingdom greatly valued this opportunity of personaldiscussions with him on matters of common interest,8. I am gratified that arrangements hove been made fora general meeting of My Prime Ministers to be held inLondon in October.9. A comprehensive trade agreement between the UnitedKingdom and Eire has recently been signed.      This agreement will, I am confident,  prove to be of benefit to both countries,and will further contribute to the growth of friendly relationsbetween them.10, My Government in the United Kingdom have concludedmutually satisfactory agreements on financial matters with my Governments in India and Pakistan.11.     .       I have given My assent to the Burma IndependenceAct, by which Burma became an independent State on kthJanuary, 19b-8.      The Treaty previously concluded between my Government and the Provisional Government of Burma wasratified on the same date.      I wish well to the Government and people of Burma.12. During the past year, Ceylon has become a fullyself-governing Member of the Commonwealth.      I wish her peopleall happiness and prosperity and I. trust that her relationswith the other nations of the Commonwealth will be close andcordial.13. My Government have continued to press ahead with theeconomic development of the Colonial territories,  in order toprovide a firm foundation for the social and. political
advancement of My Colonial peoples and to increase the worldsupply of essential foodstuffs and raw materials.i 1+- I have given assent to Constitutional Instrumentsdesigned, to facilitate the operation of essential common services in the East African territories.15* The new Federation of Malaya has been inauguratedand the new Legislative Council of the Colony of Singaporehas met.      My Ministers ore determined to restore lawand order in these territories and to suppress the outbreaks of violence which have so unhappily disturbed the peace ofthe Federation;    and to that end the police forces have been greatly strengthened and military reinforcements sent to malaya.16. I note with satisfaction the measures taken by theGovernor-General of the Sudan to set up in that territoryan Executive Council and on elected Legislative Assembly asa first step towards self-government, and I regret that theEgyptian Government have so far felt unable to join inassisting this advance.17. In accordance with plans announced some monthsearlier My Government relinquished the Mandate for Palestineon 15th May.      At the same time the Assembly of the united nations adopted a resolution setting up a United NationsMediator for Palestine, thus putting into effect a suggestion made by the United Kingdom representative.      I deeply regretthe loss of life caused by hostilities which broke out betweenthe Arabs and Jews in Palestine.      These hostilities have beenbrought to an end by the energetic action of the Mediator basedon truce resolutions adopted by the Security Council.      Thelast British forces have now been withdrawn from Palestine.
&apos;    17618, Our gratitude is due to the services rendered for so many years by the British civil administration in    . .Palestine, by members of the Palestine Police Force and bythe British Armed Forces who have served there.
