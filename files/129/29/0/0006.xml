(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE EHqPSKPY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)secret IO.P.fli8) 196 OORT NO- _____________2 3RD JULY.  lQh.5CABINSTmR PENSIONS RATESMemorandum b- the Minister of National insurance the memorandum by the Minister of Pensions (CP. (1+8) 192)raises two issues -(a) That quite apart- from the Miners&apos; SupplementarySchema there is a case for raising war pension rates on the ground they are inadequate asprovision for the &quot;deserving and needy&quot;.(b) That an Isaproveiaent in war pension rates is an inevitable consequence of the Miners1Supplementary Scheme.2. As regards (a) the Minister of Pensions recently statedthat 80 per cent, of all war pensioners are working, andtherefore earning wages in addition to their pensions and theremainder are in receipt of substantial supplementations.There can, therefore., be no case for increasing basic rates on grounds of need.     But if basic rates of war pensions are increased, and particularly If the increase is given on grounds of need,  there would immediately be a demand, which v/e couldnot possibly resist,  to increase not only the industrial injuryrates but also the rates of Sickness and Unemployment benefits and Retirement and widows&apos; pensions under the main Scheme and above all the National Assistance scales recently approved byParliament.      If we admit that the war pension rates are inadequate as provision for need,  then the main Scheme ratesand the assistance rates which are well below them are manifestlyinadequate.     I think we should be making a very serious mistakeif,  so&apos; soon after the Appointed Day for the new Insurance Schemes,v/e came out with any such suggestion.3. As regards (b) the Government are. comrnitted to the viewthat the Miners&apos; Scheme Is contributory.     Unless this view ismaintained a completely impossible situation will develop.      Ifwe say that the Miners1 Scheme is not really contributory and onthis ground increase pensions by reference to what the minerswill get,.we have no answer to a similar demand for an increasein rates of benefit paid to other Injured workmen.      But if in response to such a demand the Industrial Injury benefit rates are themselves increas-sa the miners will again get more, under their scheme and the whole process will start all-over again.h. On the merlts^f the comparison between what war pensioners and miners will get, I would draw attention to the fact (whichis brought out by the tables appended to C.P.(h8) 192)  that even-1-
with the existing rates a war pensioner with a wife and one child gets more than a similar miner will get with hisSupplementary Scheme and that the gap in favour of the warpensioner increases with the number of children.      If theproposals set out in the memorandum were adopted, a marriedwar pensioner with three children would get 22/6d.  a weekmore than the miner in spite of the fact that- the latter isbeing asked to   contribute 8d. a week towards his benefits (i.e.i+d. under the Industrial Injuries Act- and an extra hd. underthe Supplementary Scheme).      If we are to equalise treatment-under the two- Schemes we should have to start- by equalisingthe treatment of dependants&apos;  allowances;    a point on which thewar pensioner enjoys great advantages.5. I therefore regard with apprehension any proposal toraise the basic rates of war pension.6. To raise the Unemployability Supplement, for war pensioners to anything like the.35s.  or 30s. proposed wouldalso have serious consequences on the two Insurance Schemes.I should certainly have to make a corresponding increase in theUnemployability Supplement under the Industrial Injuries Schemeand this would, in turn,  create such a wide disparity betweenthe treatment- of long-term cases on industrial injury benefits and those on sickness benefit under the general scheme,  thatI should probably be forced to introduce some special allowance for the latter.7. The memorandum by the Minister of Pensions seems to meto raise two points of principle of such importance that Ihave thought it better to limit this note to comments on themand not to examine the proposals in detail at- this stage.     Thetwo points are, I suggest: -(l)    are we to adopt the view that- the current- rates ofwar pensions are inadequate on the grounds of need?If so, we must face the necessity of Increasingrates of benefit and assistance;(2)    are we to abandon the view (which I shall have tomaintain in order to get- the Scheme through theHouse of Commons)  that the Miners&apos; Scheme is tobe regarded as contributory?      If so, I see no answer to a demand for an increase in industrial injuries rates and no escape from the viciousspiral that the continued existence of the supplementary Scheme will create.J. C.Ministry of National Insurance, S.W. la,23rd July, 192+8.
