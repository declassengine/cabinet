PHIS DOCUMEIT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT);rl     secret .   1\O.P.(k8) 197 COPY NO27TH JULY. iqh8CABINETREPORT OP THE COMMITTEE ON THE WHITEPISH industry memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilIn accordance with the conclusion reached by the Cabinet attheir meeting on 15th December (C.M.(h7) 95th Conclusions^ Minute 6),we were asked by the Prime Minister to re-examine in the light-   ofuhe Cabinefs discussion the&apos;proposals for the reorganisation ofthe White Fish Industry made in memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture (C.P.(h7) 328) and bythe Minister of Food (C.P.(k7) 325).2.       In carrying out this task we considered first what new statutory powers and what changes in the exercise of the existing powers of price control were needed to promote efficiency in thecatching, processing and distribution of fish.     We then sought to decide what would be the best instrument for exercising the newpowers and, in particular, whether, as proposed by the FisheriesMinisters, a White Fish Product-ion Board should be established,3.       New -powers needed.     We are satisfied that the followingpowers should be taken -(a)   Power to give loans for the building of, .new t-raw^ers,..^, /fchempdemlBation of existing vessels&quot;We examined at length the proposal of the Fisheries ministers that- it- should be a condition of the grant of loans that the recipients were in, or would enter, combines for catching, whole-salinp- and processing fish.     We consider that there is insufficientevidence t-o show that vertical combines would always prove efficient and that it would in any case be unsound to encourage the combiningof businesses with distinct- functions merely ih order to poolprofits for the sake of the catcherso     The right course in our view is to take action to enable the catchers to pay their way whileoperating independently.     We are unable,  therefore,  to recommend the adoption of this proposal.     We consider, however, that someencouragement should be given to catchers to form themselves intolarger units, though this should not be at- the expense of singleor small units which are efficient.     We suggest,  therefore, thatthe statute should not- lay it down that loans should be given onlyto catching units with a specified minimum number of vessels, butthat the authority granting the loan should be required by statuteto satisfy it-self that any unit to which a loan was given, whetherit consisted of one or of more vessels, would be efficient.* (D)    Power .to give directions to catchers about the soaping oflandingsWe believe that- this power is necessary in order to prevent a minority of catchers from defeating the efforts which most catchersare willing to make to secure a relatively 6ven flow of landings.But the statute should make it- clear that the power must be exercised in such a way as not to impair the quality of the fish, reduce thetotal quantity landed or restrict the number of vessels operating.Catchers who fail t-o comply with directions should be liableto&quot;fines and in cases of persistent non-compliance to the suspensionor revocation of the vessel&apos;s licence.    (See (e) below).-1-
If the proposal ifco giie directions about the spacingof landings by Britlsb. vessels is adopted it will benecessary to make eei^aln adjustments in the agreementsgoverning landings froia foreign vessels which we have madewith the exporting countries.      The Ministry of Pood, whoadminister these agreements^ would make any adjustments inconsultation with the Fisheries Departments and the Boardof Trade.(c) Power to make regulations with regard to the stowage,handling, processing, transport and sale of fish inorder to safeguard Its CTPisalifcyThe regulations would provide for the adequate care of fish on board trawlers (e.gv by the provision of adequateshelving in the holds),, on landing quays,  in processingplants, during transii Ibj rail or road, and in wholesalers1or retailers&apos; premises.      We regard It as important that theregulations should not lay down requirements that wouldhave the effect of reducing tlhe quantity of fish availableto consumers; nor should itnev be sc framed as to entail theappointment of large numbers of Inspectors.(d) Power to make regulations about standards of crewaccommodationIt is clearly desirable that the Minister of transport should have this power ito siaie regulations regarding,  for examplestandards of sleeping accommodation and washing facilities.The standards laid down under earlier legislation are now very much out of date.(e) Power to license vessels to ensure that they complywith ( i) standards of crew accommodation,  (ii) directionsabout spacing of landjingrgand (iii) regulations governing the stowage and handling of fishA vessel which did not; conoly with the regulations made by the Minister of -Transport (see (dt) above) would not receive a licence and the re wdtdlM. be power to refer casesof persistent non-compliance with, the regulations governing the stowage and handling of fisla or directions about spacingof landings to an independent arbitration tribunal who,  ifthey thought fit,  could recommend the suspension or revocationof the vessel&apos;s licence..(f) Power to license port ^laoleaalers and processors witha view to ensuring that tSueir premises are clean and suitable and to securing compliance with regulations governing the quality of fishUnder powers derived frmm Defence Regulation 55 portwholesalers and processors ar-e at present licensed for thepurpose of price control and allocation of fish.      Weconsider, however, that they saould also be licensed inorder to ensure that their premises are suitable and cleanand that the regulations governing the quality of fish arecomplied with.      Cases of nerslstent non-compliance shouldbe referred to an Independent arbitration tribunal who,  ifthey thought fit,  could scorns-end the suspension or revocationof the licence.
(g)    Power to operate experimental vessels and generally to.undertake development of new processes and new equipmentIt is proposed that a trawler fitted with quick freezingapparatus should he built in order to determine whetherquick freezing at sea is a commercial proposition and if so,to hasten its development.      It Is also necessary to take powers to undertake the development of such things as new types of fishing gear.      The Fisheries Ministers aresatisfied that it would be virtually impossible to get this development work undertaken by individual groups in theindustry or by a Research Association or Development Council,h.      We considered a proposal made by the Fisheries ministers that power should be taken to set up white fish processingplants and ancillary undertakings (e.g,  ice plants and boxmaking factories) at the smaller ports.        This is already being done for herring by the Herring Industry Board,  andthe intention would be to hand the plants over to thecatchers to be run co-operatively as soon as they had beenestablished as money-making concerns.      We do not think thatthis proposal can be justified,  If a White Fish ProductionBoard is not established.5.      Exercise of existingjpowers of price control.      Underpowers derived from Defence Regulation 55 the Ministry of food control the prices of fish by fixing maximum prices at thefollowing points of sale:-(i) catcher to port wholesaler;(ii) port wholesaler to Inland wholesaler;(iii) inland wholesaler to retailer;(iv) retailer to consumer.The practice of auctioning fish at the first point of salestill continues, but when, as frequently happens, the maximum price is reached, the fish is allocated among port wholesalersaccording to their purchases in the past.      It is admitted that under this system many port wholesalers and processorsare able to make a living without rendering adequate services in return; and we have accordingly considered whether any steps might be taken to eliminate these uneconomic wholesalersand processors.The Fisheries Ministers believe that If the establishmentof vertical combines undertaking the catching, wholesalingand processing of fish were promoted the uneconomic wholesalersand processors would in time be eliminated.      As shown inparagraph 3(a)  above, however, we were unable to accept their proposals for encouraging such combines by making it acondition of loans to catchers that they should enter into them,A second suggestion, made by the Minister of Food, wasthat the present control of catchers&apos;  and port wholesalers&apos;prices should be removed In the hope that the restoration of asystem of free auctions would give the advantage to the more economic traders,  and,  in particular the co-operative societies.When, however,  this suggestion was put to the trade,  it was almost unanimously opposed by all sections, including thecatchers; and the Minister of Food reached the conclusion thatit would, be inexpedient to proceed with It.
We have also examined a suggestion that the pricemargins allowed to port wholesalers should be further reduced;    but we are satisfied that the possibilities ofeliminating redundant units by this means are too small tiojustify its adoption for this purpose.We can thus see no practicable way of eliminating theuneconomic wholesalers and processors while fish continuesto command such high prices.- 6.      Instrument for the exercise of new -powers.     the fisheries Ministers originally proposed that a White FishProduction Board, independent of the&apos;industry and subjectto. their directions, should be established with much wider powers than those that we have recommended in paragraph 3*In their opinion this Board would correspond to the WhiteFish Commission which was set up by the Sea Fish industry act, 1938* but which, owing to the war, never operated;    andits establishment would not only enable the new powers to beexercised more effectively but would also be an earnest ofthe importance attached by the Government to the re-organisation of the fishing industry.The Board, as originally proposed, would be similar insome important respects to the Commodity Commissions forreorganising the marketing and agricultural produce proposedin the Lucas Report.     The recommendations in the Lucas report are now being examined by the Food Distribution Committee andthe Economic Secretary, Treasury, who Is Chairman of that committee, has informed us that it is by no means certainthat they will be approved..We have reached the conclusion that it would be undesirable to set up a White Fish Production Board in anticipation of a decision on the wider question of CommodityCommissions.     Moreover, we believe that the establishmentof such a Board merely to exercise the limited new powersrecommended in paragraph 3 above- could not be justified.We accordingly recommend&apos;that the powers proposed inparagraph 3 should be vested in the Fisheries Deportmentsand the Ministry of Food, as follows:-(i)    The Fisheries departments should be given thepowers described in sub-paragraphs (a) (loans tocatchers),  (b)    (spacing of- landings)  (e)  (licensing of vessels) and (g)  (experimental vessels and commercial development,(ii)   The Ministry of Food should be given the powerdescribed in sub-paragraph (f)  (licensing of port wholesalers and processors)n(iii)   The power described in sub-paragraph (c) (regulations governing the quality of fish) should be conferred on the Departments jointly^.We further recommend that a joint committee of officials ofthe Departments should be established to co-ordinate theexercise of those functions which have to be exercisedcentrally.     This Committee, which should work on the linesof the Housing Production Executive, might be known as a WhiteFish Executive, and there would probably be advantages in announcing its constitution in Parliament in the proceedings on the proposed White Fish Industry Bill.      It would not
however, be appropriate to provide in the Bill for establishing the Executive, and the officers of the Fisheries departments and the Ministry of Food at the ports should continue to beappointed by and responsible to these Departments, though there should be local arrangements to co-ordinate the exerciseof their functions.7.      To sum up, we recommends-(i) that a White Fish Industry Bill should beintroduced in the 1948/49 Session to conferthe powers described in paragraph 3;(ii) that for the present a White Fish ProductionBoard should, not be established but that theexercise of the functions of the FisheriesDepartments and. the Ministry of Food relatingto the white fish industry should be co-ordinatedthrough a joint committee of officials of these departments.H.M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S.W.  1.,27th July,  1948.
