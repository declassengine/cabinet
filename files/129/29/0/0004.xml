jfEES DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENT)secretq-^w iaa - copy no..27TH july,  19U-8 &apos;CABINETORDERING- OF CIVIL aircraft memorandum by the Minister of supply the Haribury-Willion-s Committee, in their reportcirculated with C.P.(h8) 191, have made a hold attempt to cut away through the obstacles surrounding a solution of the civil aircraft procurement problem.2. The Committee was composed of industrialists with experience mainly of the normal simple relationship of buyerand seller and they believe that the best results can only beobtained when user and producer are in close and directassociation,  regardless of the nature of the article concerned.-.They discount the possibility of aircraft being an exceptionon the basis of two major assumptions both of which, however,are in my view fallacious, namely; -(a)   That the Airline Corporations are fundamentallycommercial organisations and not instruments ofna t i onal p policy *(b)    That the problems involved in aircraft design andrnanuf actbuilding.manufacture are comparable with those of ship-Having accepted these assumptions, the Committee were wholly-logical in opposing the ordering of civil aircraft through a Government Department, however successful such a system maybe in the military field.3. The Committee consider that the principal disadvantage of the present system is that- it divides responsibility betweenthe Ministry of Supply and the Corporations.   To avoid this,they recommend that in future the Corporations should order not only production aircraft but also prototypes direct fromthe manufacturer.    This proposal goes far beyond anythinghitherto suggested by any of the interests concerned.    indeed it is contrary to their unanimous recommendations to theCommittee.   Moreover it leaves uncertain what the arrangements are to be for the development of engines, propellers, radar,instruments and equipment for civil aircraft.    If these are toremain with the Ministry of Supply there would obviously be setup a far more dangerous division of responsibility than has ever existed before.    The corning generation of civil airlinersare designed round new and, as 3ret, unproved forms of power plant - propeller turbines in the Viscount, Apollo, Saunders-RocFlying  Boat and Brabazon,  and jets in the Cornet.    To introducenow a fundamental division of technical and contractualresponsibility on the development side would be foolish incleedo
It would therefore,  in all probability &quot;be found Impossibleto avoid &quot;going the whole hog&quot; and handing over to the corporations all development and production work in connectionwith civil aircraft, at an estimated value of  12 million per annum.h.* If the Corporations are,  as suggested, to be respon-sible for the prototype orders, and all the research, develop-ment work that goes with them, the technical and scientificpersonnel either of the projects departments of each corporation or of their Aircraft Requirements and Contracts Committee,would have to be immensely strengthened.   But where can staffof sufficient quality and experience be obtained?   For althoughthe Committee are reluctant to admit it in paragraph 26 oftheir Report,  the total resources available in the Industry,the Ministry of Supply Establishments and Government departments are far from adequate to deal with the work that has to &quot;bedone.   If, therefore, the Corporations took on the development work now being done for them by the Government they would haveno option but to try to attract to their employment asubstantial number of my Department&apos;s aeronautical techniciansand scientists.   This would have a most serious effect on our air re-armament programme.    In the alternative they would be unable to carry out the necessary development work and wouldhave to rely more and more on foreign aircraft to the permamentextinction of the &quot;Fly British&quot; policy.5* However, having appointed the Committee as long agoas February and announced that changes may take place as aresult of their Report, I imagine that the Cabinet may feelreluctant to reject their advicee    If they decide to acceptthe recommendations,  it logically follows that the functionsof the Ministry of Supply should in future be limited to making available so much of its research and development facilities as can be spared without detriment to fundamental research workand to development work for defence purposes.   My department would,  of course, also continue to give its advice wheneverrequired.6. There are at present a large number of developmentcontracts in operation which the Ministry of Supply has placed with industry for the benefit of civil aviation in one way or another. These contracts would be handed over to the corporation or its Committee as soon as convenient.   My Department would do all it could to make the transition envisaged as smooth aspossible.    I feel it only right, however,  to warn the Cabinetthat in my view the solution proposed by the Committee, whilerelieving my Department of a tiresome and thankless burden,would create many difficult problems and would have a serious,and possibly a disastrous,  effect on British aviation as a whole.Ministry of Supply,Shell Mex House, W.C.2.27th July, 19^8.
