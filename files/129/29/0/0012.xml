(48) 2024th August, 1948CABINETORGANISATIONS UNDER  COMMUNIST  INFLUENCENote by the Lord President of the CouncilON 8th November, 1945, the Cabinet agreed to maintain the existing practicewhereby Ministers and Departments sought the advice of the Home Secretarywhen asked to give support or assistance to organisations likely to be under theinfluence or control of the Communist Party. The Home Secretary has inpractice given both information and advice to Ministers; he has told them whether any organisation is likely to be under the influence or control of theCommunist Party and has advised them whether any official assistance shouldbe given.2. These organisations enable the British Communist Party to reach withits propaganda more persons than it could do openly; they also enable it to mobilise support among persons who would not support any policy openlyassociated with the Party. They may also provide means of recruitment forespionage work.3. I have no reason to suppose that my colleagues are not seeking the advice of the Home Secretary where necessary, but at the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestionI am reminding them of these arrangements, which should help to avoidembarrassment of the Government in the present state of international relations.4. I considered the advantages of circulating with this note a list of organisations which may come within the scope of these arrangements, but I havedecided for reasons which will be clear to my colleagues that it is better to rely on the practice of consulting the Home Secretary in every case as it arises.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council,4th August. 1948.3572024
