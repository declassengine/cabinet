(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO. ^CABINETMALAYAMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations and theSecretary of State for the colonies the Federation of Malaya is due to achieve independence withinthe Commonwealth on 31st August.   We shall, therefore, shortly haveto decide what gift might most appropriately be made by the UnitedKingdom Government to the Government and peoples of Malaya to markthis occasion.2.     After informal discussion with the Chief Minister of theFederation, we should like to recommend to our colleagues that theUnited Kingdom gift should take the form of a Post-Graduate Scholar-ship.   This might be tenable by a suitably selected, locally born residentof the Federation for a two year period at a leading University in thiscountry.3.      The annual cost of such an award should be not higher than  600per annum at present prices.   In addition, the scholar&apos;s fares to andfrom the United Kingdom would be met and this would involve anadditional sum every two years.4.      The total cost over whatever period the Scholarships ran - and wethink it is unnecessary to specify this in advance - would be higher than for the plaque or piece of statuary which we have offered as a Governmentto Government gift (at a cost of some  2,500) to Ghana.   But we shall notbe repeating in Malaya the air display costing some  35,000 which was authorised at the time of Ghana&apos;s/Indepetidence.5.      We feel that the award of a Post-Graduate Scholarship would bean imaginative gesture.   It already has the informal approval of theChief Minister in Malaya.   Should our colleagues agree to it, we would,of course, seek the further views of the Federation Government on the title and other details of the proposed award.H.A .L .-B.confidential.(57) 16310th July, 195710th July, 1957
