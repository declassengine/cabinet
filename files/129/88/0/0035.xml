secret.(57) 185 COPY NO31st July, 1957CABINET.&quot;0-2.COTTON imports memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of TradeI attach a report by officials of the Treasury, Colonial Officeand the Board of Trade in pursuance of our discussion last week(C.C.(57) 57th Conclusions, Minute 9).  I agree with the report that weshould drop the &quot;peril point&quot; idea and I hope that my colleagues willapprove the alternative course of action now recommended.2.       I must stress the urgency of a decision whether or not to help the industry on the lines suggested.   The home market can barelyabsorb current production after allowing for imports on the one handand exports on the other.   Exports will be further hit by the Australianagreement with Japan, so that home production is almost bound to be cut back severely this autumn.3.       If Sir Cuthbert Clegg cannot get a voluntary agreement withall three Eastern countries in the near future and imports rise furtherwe must expect a difficult and explosive situation that will cause verygreat political trouble.D.E.Board of Trade, S.W.1.30th July, 1957
IMFORTS OF COTTON TEXTILES from india, PAKISTAN AND HONG KONGNote by officials the Cabinet invited the President of the Board of Trade, inconsultation with the Colonial Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer to arrange for a more detailed examination of the possibilityof securing a limitation of exports of Hong Kong cotton textiles to thiscountry by the establishment of a &quot;peril point&quot; for these exports.2.      Officials of the Treasury, Colonial Office and the Board of trade have considered this possibility and submit the following report.3.     There are grave dangers for our whole trading relations inembarking on any course which may ultimately involve Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in applying quota restrictions for protective purposes.Quotas on Commonwealth and Colonial imports would be particularly difficult to defend.   Nevertheless, it would not have been reasonable torefuse the textile industry&apos;s request for Government blessing for the talks between the industries of the countries concerned given on14th July, 1956 by the then Prime Minister, with the agreementof Mr. Nehru.4.     If Ministers consider that the Government cannot refuse the appealof Sir Cuthbert Clegg, who heads the Lancashire mission, to assist thefurther progress of these discussions and must take some furtherinitiative, we are agreed in recommending that such initiative should notbe by way of the &quot;peril point&quot; procedure.  It would imply that theGovernment considered it legitimate in certain circumstances to take action irrespective of the balance of payments to protect a domesticindustry (and moreover against Colonial trade).   This would have far-reaching consequences for our commercial policy generally, and, inparticular, our authority internationally to protect the interests of ourColonies in third markets which the Treaty of Rome has made animmediate issue.   In any event, there seems no prospect of negotiating&quot;peril points&quot; which would be acceptable both to Lancashire and to theindustries of the countries concerned.5.      We have accordingly considered an alternative proposal whichgoes back to the industry&apos;s original suggestion of a voluntary agreement,but does not involve an undertaking to apply quota restrictions againstHong Kong.6.     The proposal is that the industry should try to reach a voluntary agreement with the industries of India and Pakistan, to be administered(at the ir request) by import licensing here, on the understanding that therewould be a similar agreement with the Hong Kong industry, to be policed,however, by the Hong Kong industry itself.   If the Hong Kong industryfailed to keep within the limits voluntarily agreed, the industries of Indiaand Pakistan would be released from their agreement.   The Governmentwould then be faced with a new situation and would have to decide whether to accept the failure of the scheme or to intervene directly, e.g. by theimposition of quota restrictions.
7.      or this scheme to be successfully launched, it would be essential for the Governor of Hong Kong to meet the Hong Kong industry and speak to them on the following lines.   He would outline   the situation facing thecotton industry and say that it was viewed with concern by the UnitedKingdom Government.   Sir Cuthbert Clegg^ talks in India and Pakistanoffered the prospect that the United Kingdom industry would be able tonegotiate a voluntary agreement with the industries of those countries,to be policed by import licensing by the United Kingdom Government.Such an agreement could be maintained only for so long as we could showthat some agreed limit on Hong Kong imports was not being exceeded.It would, therefore, be necessary for Sir Cuthbert Clegg to reach agree-ment with the Hong Kong industry also on a ceiling for imports.   TheGovernor would add that the intention would be that the Hong Kong industry should be responsible for policing the agreement.   If (like India and pakistan) they asked the United Kingdom Government to undertake it byimport licensing, we would be ready to do so.   We should equally beready to do so if, after the Hong Kong industry had agreed to a celling,their voluntary enforcement measures proved ineffective, therebyreleasing the Indian and Fakistan industries from their agreement.8.     If the Hong Kong industry asked the Governor what would happen in the event of their finding themselves unable to agree to a ceiling or,if their enforcement proved ineffective, to United Kingdom policing on theIndian and Pakistan model, the Governor would have to say that thiswould present a new situation which would have to be considered at thetime; the United Kingdom Government had reached no decision as totheir action in those circumstances.   But he would add that in that event the pressures already exerted on the United Kingdom to take restrictiveaction would be intensified.conclusion.     If Ministers decide that some new initiative by the United KingdomGovernment is required, we are agreed that a proposal on the linesdescribed in paragraph 6 to 8 above is the best that can be devised.   we feel we must warn Ministers, however, that the chances of the Hong Kongindustry being able to police an export limitation effectively are not good.If they failed, the whole scheme would collapse unless the UnitedKingdom Government were prepared to impose an import control.   Therewould be great pressure for this, which the Government would find moredifficult than ever to resist.  An imposed quota restriction againstHong Kong would, however, bring all those grave consequences for our colonial and commercial policies of which Ministers are aware.
