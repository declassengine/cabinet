Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1957CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (57) 18330th July, 1957CABINETMALTAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies circulate the following on the talks with the Prime Minister of Malta,Mr. Mintoff, for my colleagues&apos; information.2. My talks with Mr. Mintoff on future economic and financial arrangementsended on 23rd July in the attached memorandum of agreement. This will not bepublished now but will form part of any final settlement on the new constitutional arrangements.3. Broadly, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have secured what we have said we wanted (and hope still do!) and we now have a satisfactory basis on which toproceed with the rest of the negotiations, planned for September.4. We are not committed to any guarantee of comparable living standards;and Mr. Mintoff accepted that, when the agreement is published, I would make clear that the attainment of economic equivalence could not be guaranteed byanyone, certainly not by Her Majesty&apos;s Government. The main theme of theagreement is increasing the productivity of the Island, and to this end we haveagreed to set up a &quot; Chandos Committee&quot; (like the Northern Irish one)immediately.5. As regards education, I was able to secure agreement on a provision whichwill be less expensive than my colleagues were prepared to envisage. Moreover,we have bound Mr. Mintoff to devote the extra aid offered solely to educationalservices. I was thus able to show a little latitude on the aid for health, which hasbeen raised from one-quarter to one-third.6. The appointment of a commission of review proved to be the most difficult point. I resisted Mr. Mintoffs pressure for an annual commission and very strenuous negotiation ended in the compromise embodied in paragraph 16of the memorandum.7. The talks also covered discharges by the Services arising out of reductions in this year&apos;s Votes. With the co-operation of the Service Departments, measureswhich will alleviate the local situation this year were agreed. It was, however,made clear to Mr. Mintoff that Her Majesty&apos;s Government could not accept any liability to keep employment by the Services at any predetermined level or toprovide continuous employment by other means. It was agreed that a statement to this effect should be made both here and in Malta.8. As regards the eventual impact in Malta of our long-term defence policy,I undertook that the Maltese Government would be consulted before any final decisions concerning Malta are taken. I hope that our study of this, which theMinister of Defence has already agreed to accelerate, can be completed before the talks with Mr. Mintoff in September, although I made no promise of this.A.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT ON ECONOMIC AND financial arrangements CONSEQUENT UPON THE NEW CONSTITUTIONALARRANGEMENTSI. Objectives of policy. Her Majesty&apos;s Government approve and support the ultimate aim of the maltese Government, namely, that the Islands should, after a reasonable periodof years and through policies which increase the economic strength of the Islands,reach an economy and a standard of living comparable to that of the UnitedKingdom. Both Governments agree to work towards that aim within the framework of this agreement.2. The two Governments agree that this aim will take time to achieve andthat in the interim period special measures are needed to improve the productivity of the Islands and generally to help the Maltese people forward especially on suchmatters as education and other social benefits.3. It will be open to the Maltese Government after a period of twelve to fifteen years to request that their economy become an integral part of that of theUnited Kingdom when direct and indirect taxation, rates, and social contributions and benefits would be on the United Kingdom pattern, and Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would view any such request with great sympathy and entertain itunless there were strong reasons to the contrary.4. Both Governments agree that the attainment of such a change wouldbe considerably aided if the productivity drive has succeeded in bringing the economy of Malta to a level which, taking account of all relevant factors, iscomparable to that of the United Kingdom. The Maltese Governmentrecognises the obligation of the Maltese people to make sustained efforts to achieve this aim.5. The Maltese Government will draw up plans aimed at increasing the productivity and the living standards and expanding the national income of malta.  In drawing up these plans, account will be taken of the need: -(a) to diversify the economy and in particular to create opportunities for industrial development, including tourism, designed to make possiblethe economic viability of the Islands, and to reduce its dependence on united Kingdom contributions;(b) to raise the standard of education, health and social welfare;(c) to maintain full employment;(d) to provide positive incentives to emigration.II. Financial Arrangements6. As a first step towards the attainment of the objectives of policy set outin Section I above, and bearing in mind the need to increase the productivity and develop the economy of the Islands in order to enable social services and living standards to be progressively increased, the following financial arrangements for a capital programme and for recurrent expenditure will, subject to the provisions ofSection IV below, apply to the first five years after the change in constitutional status:(i) Capital programme. The United Kingdom Government^ contribution to the capital development programme shall be approximately  25 million of which not more than 5 million in new money shall be issued in any one year. This assistance will bebrought to account by the Maltese Government as part of the revenues of Malta.8. The capital budget will consist of all development works or projectsincluding all war damage and reconstruction works and projects appropriate tothe war damage and reconstruction grant under the Malta (Reconstruction) Act,1947.
9. During this period the fixed contribution to capital development made bythe United Kingdom Government will consist of:  (a) the balance of the war damage grant in the Consolidated Revenue fund of the Government of the United Kingdom until this grant is exhausted,amounting to   at(b) a sum equivalent to the balance of the Colonial Development and Welfareallocation made to Malta amounting to   at(c) a sum sufficient to make good the difference between the total of (a) and (b)and the amount of the aggregate contribution for the period (i.e., the 25 million mentioned in paragraph 6 above).10. The United Kingdom Government will use its good offices to assist the maltese Government in the establishment in Malta of industrial firms in order toincrease Maltese productivity and thus provide the economic basis for a steady increase in Maltese living standards.(ii) Recurrent Expenditure11. The recurrent budget will consist of all governmental services not appropriate to the capital budget. The United Kingdom Government share theview of the Maltese Government as to the importance of the development of Malta&apos;ssocial services, especially education and health. Moreover, the United KingdomGovernment recognise that this programme will not show much return in the early years; and they are consequently anxious to give continued financial help on an assured basis.12. The United Kingdom Government therefore undertake to make anannual contribution towards the Maltese recurrent budget for the first five years,calculated as follows.13. In regard to the Education, Health and Social Welfare Services of the maltese Government in so far as they are regarded by both Governments ascoming within the field of social services, the United Kingdom Government will contribute:  (i) in respect of Education, one-third of the annual recurrent expenditureof the Education service if such expenditure is less than  1,250,000, or one-half of the annual recurrent expenditure if such expenditure is 1,250,000 or more;(ii) in respect of Health, one-third of the annual recurrent expenditure;(iii) in respect of Social Welfare Services other than Education and Health,one-quarter of the annual recurrent expenditure.Provided that:(1) the payments by the United Kingdom Government in respect of educationunder sub-paragraph (i) above shall be allocated exclusively toeducational services approved by both Governments;(2) the payment by the United Kingdom Government under sub-paragraphs (i),(ii) and (iii) above taken together shall be subject to a minimum annual payment of  1 million.III. General Provisions14. The United Kingdom Government recognise that any drastic change in imperial Defence policy affecting Malta might alter considerably the basis on whicha capital expenditure plan was drawn up and the level of employment in Malta.In such circumstances the United Kingdom Government would be willing to review the position. In particular, if in consequence of such a change in ImperialDefence policy the level of unemployment in Malta should reach and, for sixmonths, remain at a higher level than the rate of unemployment in the UnitedKingdom at the time, the United Kingdom Government would be willing to assistthe Maltese Government in taking remedial measures to be agreed.15. The Government of Malta will secure the agreement of the UnitedKingdom before raising money by loan or by temporary advances above a level of temporary advances reached at any time in the twelve months ended 31st March,1958. The United Kingdom Parliament will be furnished annually with the auditedaccounts of the Maltese Government.
IV.-Appointment of Commission16. The two Governments agree that, if either Government should so request,an independent Commission shall be brought into being after a period of not lessthan two years from the initialling of this Agreement to consider the working ofthe financial arrangements set out in Section II above and, in the light of the objectives of policy set out in Section I, to advise the two Governments on whatmodification, including modification of the amounts, within the pattern ofSection II above, is considered necessary or desirable in respect of the remainingpart of the five-year period. The two Governments further agree that towardsthe end of the first five-year period an independent Commission shall be set up, thetask of which will be to review the progress made in Malta towards the ultimate aim of reaching an economy and a standard of living comparable to that of theUnited Kingdom and in particular to examine the progress achieved, as a result ofthe joint efforts of the two Governments, in increasing the productivity and developing the economy of the Islands, to consider what further progress may bepossible in these respects; and in the light of their assessment to advise the twoGovernments on what further measures or alternative arrangements it might benecessary and desirable to adopt, bearing in mind the objectives of policy as defined in Section I of this memorandum.
