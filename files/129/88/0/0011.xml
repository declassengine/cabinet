THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 1619th July, 1957CABINETCYPRUSMemorandum by the Prime MinisterWe must take a fresh initiative to break the present deadlock.Cyprus is, as we know, not a Colonial problem but an international problem.No solution will be acceptable which does not satisfy the interests of the UnitedKingdom, Greece and Turkey. Our interest is to secure our essential military needs and to reduce our Colonial commitment. Turkey, though she favours partition,is mainly concerned to ensure that the island shall never pass wholly under thecontrol of Greece. Greece will continue to demand Enosis but must be convincedthat it cannot be attained.2. After discussion with those of my colleagues who are most directly concerned and after consultation with the Governor of Cyprus I recommend thatwe should now put forward new proposals on the following lines:  (a) Our essential military needs in Cyprus are to secure the continued use ofan operational air base, primarily for the support of the Bagdad Pact,and of certain wireless facilities for intelligence and propaganda purposes which cannot be provided elsewhere. These needs can bemet if we insist on retaining exclusive British sovereignty over relatively small enclaves at Akrotiri-Episcopi, Dhekelia-Pergamos, Cap Grecoand a few small establishments elsewhere which are required for wireless services. These areas would be small in extent and there would befew Cypriots resident within them.(b) We should offer to surrender the rest of the Island to a condominium ofthe United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey. The sovereignty would be vested in the three countries jointly. The indigenous population wouldacquire Greek and Turkish as well as British nationality.
(c) The whole of the Island outside the British enclaves would be placed under the government of a Governor to be nominated by the threesovereign Powers or, in default of agreement between them, to beappointed by the Powers (other than the three sovereign Powers) whichare for the time being members of the North Atlantic Alliance. TheGovernor should not himself be a national of any of the three sovereignPowers. The Governor, once appointed, would be responsible to thethree sovereign Powers (see below). His appointment could be terminated by the agreement of the three Powers or, in default of such agreement and on appeal from two of them, by the other north atlantic Powers.(d) The three sovereign Powers would appoint resident representatives to watch their interests in Cyprus. Their status and precise functionsrequire further consideration. Their duties would probably range fromconsular work to the duty of advising the Governor on &quot; reserved &quot;subjects.(e) Outside the British enclaves there would be a system of responsibleself-government on the general lines of the constitution proposed in lord Radcliffe&apos;s report. This constitution would need to be adapted to accord with the concept of a triple sovereignty and Lord Radcliffemight himself be asked to advise what detailed changes would berequired. If the general concept were accepted, the three governments should offer to discuss these adaptations with representatives of allinterests in the Island. Meanwhile, the essential features would seem tobe as follows:  (i) As regards internal affairs (other than internal security) theGovernor would act on the advice of Ministers responsible toan elected Chamber except where the constitution expresslyprovided otherwise.(ii) The  &quot; reserved&quot;  subjects  would  comprise  defence,  external relations and internal security.(iii) The constitutional responsibility for the external defence of the island must rest with the three sovereign Powers. As, however,those Powers are all members of the North Atlantic Alliance itwould be reasonable that they should look to the Council of the alliance to interest themselves in its defence.(iv) The external relations of the Island, so far as they raise any practical problem, would be conducted by the three sovereignPowers.(v) On matters of internal security the Governor would have theassistance of an advisory body comprising the residentrepresentatives of the three sovereign Powers and appropriateelected Ministers. He would be able to call on a forcecomprising British, Turkish and Greek contingents, in equal numbers, who would be available to support the civil power in maintaining law and order.
(/) These arrangements should not be subject to any limit of duration. Theyshould be designed to remain in force indefinitely though provision would need to be made for their amendment or termination byagreement between the three sovereign Powers.3. It will not be easy to secure agreement to a solution on these lines. but what are the alternatives? To carry on as we are, in the hope that disorder willbe suppressed and the agitation for Enosis will die away? This would commit to cyprus a disproportionate amount of our military strength; it would offer no earlyprospect of an easement of the internal political situation in the Island; and itwould be unlikely to produce any solution within the lifetime of this Parliament.The other alternative is partition. This would be a confession of failure.Moreover, it would involve a grave risk of open conflict between Greece and turkey. And in the Island itself it would mean great hardship, suffering and disorder with widespread bloodshed. I do not think we should ourselves acceptthe responsibility for this. If partition were the only course open, I would wish that it should be undertaken by some international agency.The plan which I have outlined could be presented as a just and fair solution which would avoid those evil consequences. If it were rejected we should beentitled to ask either that the United Nations itself should assume responsibilityfor partition, or that we should be allowed to continue to administer the Islandunder our own sovereignty and be supported in so doing.4. This plan could not succeed without the maximum of international co--operation and good will; and all the influences making for this must be mobilisedin its support. We must rely especially on the United States Government and theNorth Atlantic Council. At the outset, therefore, we must persuade president eisenhower and M. Spaak that an initiative on these lines, which calls for somesacrifice of national interest by all the parties concerned, offers the best hope forthe future peace and stability of the Island and get their assurance that they willvigorously commend it and, in particular, bring all possible pressure on the GreekGovernment to accept it. We must recognise that Greek acceptance can besecured only by American pressure. Simultaneously we should do our utmost to convince the Turkish Government that this is a reasonable plan and that they have nothing to gain and possibly something to lose by rejecting it in the hope that by their obduracy they may achieve partition.5. If we decide to adopt this plan we should do so, not as a mere tacticalmove, but because we believe it to offer a sound and practical solution and areresolved to do all in our power to make it work. We should make this plain toall concerned. We must also move quickly. We should aim to complete ourdiplomatic soundings in time to enable us to launch the plan publicly, with themaximum assurance of international support, well before the next meeting of theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations.H. M.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,8th July, 1957.
