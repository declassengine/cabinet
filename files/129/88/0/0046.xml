POLIOMYELITIS VACCINATIONMemorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of HealthVaccination against poliomyelitis is at present being offered to children up to age 10.    There is a strong case on medical grounds for extending the offer to children up to age 15 and to expectant mothers.Assuming a 50 per cent acceptance rate, the number still to be vaccinatedin these and certain minor categories is 4. 5 millions together with350,000 children born in 1957 who will become eligible for vaccination.The Government will be strongly criticised if any large number of them is left unvaccinated by next summer when polio may again becomeprevalent.    The supply of vaccine from British manufacturers up to30th June, 1958, would however enable only 2.4 millions to be vaccinatedby then: a further 4,000 - 5,000 litres of vaccine would be required tovaccinate the remainder by that date.    Detailed figures are appended.2.      The vaccine so far used in this country has, on the advice ofthe Medical Research Council, differed from the American Salk vaccine,which is prepared from a virulent strain of virus, involving a residualrisk of causing paralytic polio.     Our own vaccine is free from this risk.    The Council has, however, now recommended that the risk of using Salk vaccine must be weighed against the danger in leaving a largenumber of children unvaccinated and that consideration should be givento the import of American vaccine temporarily if British vaccinecannot be produced in sufficient quantity to meet the need before next summer.3.     There are no prospects of increasing the quantity of home-produced vaccine beyond that already mentioned by 30th June.    (A smallmargin must be left to the firms to build up an export trade).    British-type vaccine could be manufactured by Canadian or American firms, butsupplies would not be available in appreciable amounts before next summer.The only way of obtaining the required quantity is therefore to importAmerican vaccine from Canada or the United States.    This, on present information, could be obtained between January and June, 1958.4.     The vaccine would be imported under Crown privilege as atemporary measure so as to avoid licensing it under the TherapeuticSubstances Act.    A licence would imply a degree of confidence in itspurity and potency which my advisers are unable to give to it.    Thelicence could not be withdrawn so long as the technical conditions imposed were complied with.    It would thus become possible for Americanfirms to establish a market for their vaccine in this country.COPY NO.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)*m wm ma mm n as hb mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm m-t     mm mm mm. mm mm mm mm, ma mm mm *b* mm aSECRETC.(57) 1967th September, 1957.CABINET
5.     The cost of the vaccine would be much the same as that nowbeing negotiated for current supplies in this country -  ZOO per litre(4s. per dose or 8/- per person) or about  800,000 to  1 million in dollar expenditure.6.     The import of Salk vaccine would reverse the policy hithertoadopted by the Government on earlier medical advice and the presentation of this change of policy needs careful consideration.A press announcement will be agreed with the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.7.     As my colleagues will realise, this is a difficult field inwhich to plan precisely.    If the recommendation below is approved,I shall negotiate forthwith in the United States and Canada for thepurchase of the necessary vaccine.    In the light of further informationbecoming available on the supplies of British vaccine here or overseas,I shall seek guidance from my colleagues as to future policy on theextension of vaccination arrangements.8.      I recommend that vaccination should be extended to the categories mentioned in paragraph 1 above and that, as a temporary measure, up to 5,000 litres of Salk vaccine should be imported,mainly from Canada but, if necessary, also from the United States.J.K.V-M.Ministry of Health, S.W.1.6th September, 1957.
