I regret that theyare &quot;being circulated so late, &quot;but I have only seen the papers on my return from the Middle East this afternoon.2.      There can &quot;be no question hut that we must workwholeheartedly and sincerely for comprehensive disarmament.However, any measure of partial disarmament is liable to expose us to grave peril.3.     Until such time as comprehensive disarmament can heachieved, the security of, the Y/e stern world rests almost wholly upon the nuclear deterrent, without which Russia&apos;spreponderance in manpower and conventional weapons would giveher overwhelming military superiority.      Consequently, thevagueness of the Stassen proposals in regard to the later stages of conventional disarmament give cause for considerableconcern.4.     On the nuclear side, the Stassen proposals in practicefall into two stages.      In the first, there is to be a cessation of nuclear tests followed &quot;by the cessation ofmanufacture of fissile material for military purposes.Subsequently, it is contemplated that there will be anagreement for the progressive dismantling of the stocks of nuclear weapons already manufactured and the transfer of thefissile materials they contain to peaceful purposes.5.     If it were carried through to its ultimate conclusion(which the Americans have made it clear they do not intend),this process would result in the final elimination of allnuclear weapons5    and, provided it is accompanied by a reallymassive reduction in conventional armaments, it would obviously be an unmitigated blessing to mankind.6.     On the other hand, unless the cuts in military manpower and conventional weapons are much more drastic than thoseenvisaged in the Stassen proposals, the complete elimination of nuclear armaments would unquestionably leave Russia withdecisive military superiority.1.     Since both the Americans and the Russians well understandin which field their advantage, lies, it is more than likely that they will be unable to agree on any plans extending beyondthe first stage in either the conventional or the nuclearsphere.8.      If the process of disarmament stopped at this point, themilitary consequences would be particularly unfavourable toGreat Britain.     The proposal for the early cessation of testsand of the production of fissile material for military purposesCOPY NO._(o
would virtually knock Britain out as a nuclear power.      On theother hand, America and Russia, who have carried out most ofthe tests they need and already possess substantial stocks of nuclear weapons and fissile material, would not he seriously affected.9.      Thus, while Russia would continue to retain her fullarsenal of nuclear weapons with which to attack us if shechose, we should he prevented from providing ourselves either with the means of retaliation or with the means of self-defence with ground-to-air nuclear missiles.      This might well leaveBritain for an indefinite period in a state of completenakedness.10.    I naturally realise that, it would he extremely awkwardfor us to stand out and to lay ourselves open to the charge ofwrecking the first hopeful step towards world disarmament.At the same time,  I do not think it is reasonable for the americans to design their plan in such a way that the first stage, which may prove also to &quot;be the last,  should he achievedalmost wholly at our expense.11.    I recommend,  therefore, that we should make it clear tothe Americans that we could support the Stassen proposals onlyon the following conditions, namely;-(-a) that the successive stages for the reduction ofconventional forces should he firmly laid down inthe agreement, and that the timing of them shouldhe linked to the timing of the various stages of nuclear disarmament;(h) that this reduction in conventional forces shouldhe taken far enough to ensure that, if nuclear weapons were eliminated, Russia would not be left in a position to dominate Europe with conventionalarms i(c) that the progress both of conventional and nucleardisarmament should be effectively inspected and controlled;    and(d) that, unless it can be agreed to carry throughboth the elimination of nuclear weapons and the drastic red\iction of conventional forces within ashort space of years, the United States should undertake to provide us with;-(i) the technical &quot;know-how&quot; to perfectour own nuclear weapons;    and(ii) a quantity of fissile material sufficientto enable us to build up a reasonablestock of nuclear weapons, primarily fordefensive purposes.12.     An arrangement of this kind could only be obtained by direct negotiation between the Prime Minister and thePresident;    and I hope very much that it may be possible forthis to take place before we are asked to commit ourselves tothe Stassen proposals or anything like them.D.S.Ministry of Defence, S/,7.1.23rd June, 1957.
