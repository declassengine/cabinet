CHAPTER ITHE PATTERM OF UNITED KINGDOM POLICYEach, independent member of the Commonwealth has its own policy for the development of its resources.     Each relieslargely upon its own wealth to finance new public services, new industry and the expansion of primary production of all kinds0The same is true of Colonial territories which are advancingtowards independence.      Indeed the more an emergent country isable itself to finance, or to attract the finance for,  thedevelopment of its own resources,  the fuller is the reality ofthe independence which it seeks to achieve.2.      This independence must be seen against a background ofeconomic inter-dependence.      Each member of the Commonwealthplays its own part in Commonwealth development, production andtrade,, but for historic as well as economic reasons the UnitedKingdom is the key stone of the Commonwealth economic structure.It is the centre of -&amp;he sterling area to which all commonwealth countries,  save Canada, belong.      It has a longer and morevaried experience of overseas investment than any other countryin the world.      It is the only country in the Commonwealth whichis a net long-term investor abroad.      Although its fellow membersof the Commonwealth,  particularly Canada,  Have made immensestrides in tne development of their industrial potentials,  theUnited Kingdom has the greatest technical resources and thelargest trade of any Commonwealth country.      It possessesspecial responsibilities for fostering the economic welfare of dependent territories scattered all over the world.3.     The development of the resources of the Commonwealth is a process to which all its members contribute,  although thenature and extent of each contribution is a matter for decisionwithin each country.      In shaping the pattern of the contribution made by the United Kingdom, Her Majesty&apos;s government believe that the following guiding principles must be observed.
(i)    In the first plaoe the ability of trie United kingdom to play an effective part in the provision of resources for investment in the Commonwealth overseas depends upon themaintenance of the strength of sterling and the sucessfuldevelopment of the United Kingdom&apos;s own economy.     the temptation to accept liabilities which would overtax its resources and strain its financial structure is dangerousnot only to the United Kingdom &quot;but to the Commonwealth asa whole.(ii)    Since the strength of sterling is the basis of the prosperity of their trade and is also the foundation oftheir development, members of the sterling Commonwealthall have a vital interest in avoiding policies which mayweaken it.(iii)-   Thirdly the Commonwealth does not possess, within itsown boundaries,  all the capital required to carry outdevelopment on the scale or at the pace which its peoplesseek.      It is therefore right that additional capital shouldbe sought from outside, both from the non-sterling capitalmarkets of the world and from international institutions.Well conceived expansion thus financed should result in anincrease in general economic activity which benefits theCommonwealth as a whole and thus enables external loans tobe serviced and repaid.(iv)    It is through the investment of privately owned funds in the Commonwealth that the United Kingdom has made its most valuable contribution to development in other commonwealth countries, and Her Majesty&apos;s government consider that this should continue.      Capital of this kind,originating from private sources in this country, not onlyis well adapted to the financing of mining,  industrial,manufacturing and other enterprise in Commonwealth countriesbut also, through the medium of public loans on the london market can assist in meeting the needs of Commonwealth and/Colonial
Colonial Governments for primary development,  such aspower and communications.     Private enterprise is betteradapted to undertake the risk investment which oftenproduces the most valuable addition to economic progress.Direct private investment forges the most permanent tradinglinks between countries and opens up the field, as is emphasised elsewhere, for the exchange of technical skills.Private capital will flow most readily for these purposesto those Commonwealth countries which take practical stepsto attract it,(v)    The provision of capital is only a part of the problemsof Commonwealth development.      Money must be matched withtechnical skill and organisation.     The technical resources available in the United Kingdom are considerably greaterthan those of any other member of the Commonwealth,     TheUnited Kingdom is undergoing what amounts to a new industrial Revolution,    Its needs for technical and scientific manpower are growing,      Nevertheless it must continue to be an important aim of the United kingdom to meet the needs of the less developed commonwealth countries for technical and scientific aid,CHAPTER IITHE UNITED KINGDOM&apos;S CONTRIBUTION 1952 - 1957Uo     The necessity for pursuing common objectives in the field of economic development was emphasised by the commonwealth economic Conference in 1952,      The communique issued after theconference (Cmd. 8717) stateds-&quot;The Conference agreed that in sterling area countriesdevelopment should be concentrated on projects whichdirectly or indirectly contribute to the improvement ofthe area&apos;s balance of payments with the rest of the world.Such projects should strengthen the economy of thecountries concerned and increase their competitive power
in. world markets and so, by improving their balance ofpayments, bring increasing prosperity to their peoples.In some countries of the area,  however,  development plans have been or are being made to provide for some basicimprovement in the standards of living, which is a necessary foundation for further economic development,,Some social investment is also urgently needed in the moredeveloped countries,  certain of which have rapidly increasing populations.      The Conference recognised theneed in such cases for these types of investment.&quot;5.     The United Kingdom for its part gave special undertakings which were also set out in the communique&quot;:-&quot;The United Kingdom is the traditional source of externalcapital for Commonwealth investment and has special responsibilities in the Colonial territories.      The UnitedKingdom Government are determined that the flow of capitalfrom London for sound development throughout the Commonwealthshall be maintained and increased ....      The UnitedKingdom Government have .... undertaken to make aspecial effort to provide additional capital for Common-wealth development by facilitating the financing of schemes in other Commonwealth countries which will contribute tothe improvement of the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments.The Conference took note that the United Kingdom Governmentwould wish, before making any of this additional financeavailable for Commonwealth development,  to be sure that thecountry concerned was itself devoting an adequate part ofits resources to investment designed to improve the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments and was ready to makea sufficient contribution towards the particular scheme inquestion,  to ensure that both countries had an interest inseeing that it was carried through as efficiently and economically as possible.&quot;
6.      These undertakings were renewed in the communique&apos; issued after the Conference of Commonwealth Finance Ministers inJanuary, 1954-      It was explained at the same time that sterling commonwealth Governments could borrow in the London market forgeneral development programmes as well as for specific projects,subject to the same tests.      Since the end of the war sterling commonwealth Governments have had a preferential position inrelation to the London Market since no other Government has been permitted to issue stock there.,7o      The conditions on which capital could be raised in theUnited Kingdom by private interests for investment in theCommonwealth were also eased.      Before 1953 permission to borrow for investment overseas was only approved for proposalslikely to be,  in a variety of different ways, of direct assistance to the United Kingdom.      Since the beginning of 1953these conditions have included projects designed to help the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments generally and not merelyschemes of direct benefit to the United Kingdom itself.     TheUnited Kingdom operates no exchange control on the movement ofcapital from this country to sterling area countries.8.      The following paragraphs describe the channels through which investment has taken place since 1952 in accordance withthis policy.      These can be conveniently divided into two categories - those for the investment of privately owned funds(whether the borrower is an overseas government or a privateundertaking),  and those for the investment of money provided bythe United Kingdom Exchequer.PRIVATE FUNDSBorrowing by Commonwealth and Colonial Governments on theLondon market9.      From the end of 192+6 up to May 1957 Commonwealth and colonial Governments have borrowed  262.7 million on the london market (excluding sums set aside for local subscription).     Ofthis total  13h million have been raised since the end of 1952./the
the Colonial tevritorice borrowing  74 million and independent commonwealth countries  60 million.      These figures do not include conversion issues and do not take account ofredemptions of maturing loans.     These loans are raised to finance public capital works undertaken by the governmentsconcerned or by public authorities.     For example,  the issue bythe East Africa High Commission, of  11.5 million in May of thisyear,   is to be used for the development of the railways,  harbours,postal and telegraphic services in East Africa.     Borrowings onthe London market are dealt with, in accordance with the policy set out in paragraph 7 and consent is given provided that thecountry concerned is devoting in general an adequate part ofits own resources to investment designed to improve the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments and is ready to make a sufficientcontribution of its own to financing the particular project orprogramme for which the loan is designed.Private Borrowing on the London market10.    The borrowing of amounts of over  10,000 requires Treasuryconsent.     Since 1952 consent for private borrowing on theLondon market for investment in the sterling Commonwealth havebeen running at a rate of between  35 million and  2+0 million a year.Commonwealth Development Finance Company11.     The Company was set up in 1953?  as a new channel for the investment of private capital in Commonwealth development schemes likely to benefit the sterling area&apos;s balance ofpayments and in particular those schemes for which adequatecapital cannot be raised from ordinary sources.    it represents a special channel for private lending through theLondon market,,    Its capital has been subscribed by ninety-onebusiness concerns in the United Kingdom and by the Bank ofEngland.    Its authorised capital is  15 million, and it is empowered to borrow up to twice this figure on the market.Its commitments at the end of March 1957 totalled approximately 1h.5 million in twelve projects in eight commonwealth countries.     These include electricity supply undertaleings,pulp/
pulp manufacturing, pipelines for the transmission of natural gas, uranium mining and the production of agriculturalfertilizers.    The Commonwealth countries in which this development is principally &quot;being carried out are Canada,New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan and the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland.Other Private Investment12.     As well as new money raised on the London market,  thereis a substantial flow of private investment financed from theexisting resources of United Kingdom firms,  and by the ploughing back of profits by United Kingdom companies operating in the Commonwealth overseas.    Its volume is exceedingly difficult to estimate but it represents a majorelement in the United kingdom&apos;s investment in the sterling commonwealth.    In this category is included investment in the primary producing industries such as rubber,  tea and copperand the establishment of branches of large United Kingdomcompanies to manufacture such things as motor vehicles,chemical products and textiles in various commonwealth countries and investment, including exploration costs by united Kingdom oil companies.Total investment of private funds in the Sterling Commonwealth13.      In the absence of any control on capital movements fromthe United Kingdom to the rest of the sterling area,  it is notpossible to measure exactly the value of United Kingdominvestment in the sterling Commonwealth.    It is estimatedhowever that the net private long-term capital outflow fromthe United Kingdom, whether through direct investmenttransactions,  or the London market (including theCommonwealth Development Finance Company) has averaged well over  100 million a year since 1952.CanadaHi.      The paragraphs above have described investment in the sterling Commonwealth,    Canada, being a dollar country,presents/
presents different problems from those in sterling commonwealth countries,    Nevertheless in recent years aliberal policy has been followed towards direct new investment in Canada,  thus maintaining traditional Commonwealth economiclinks between Canada and the United Kingdom.    AvailableCanadian records show that net direct investment, includingthe ploughing back of profits, has reached an annual average over the years 1953 to 1956 of slightly more than  30 million.EXCHEQUER FUNDS15*     United Kingdom Government funds are directed mainly tothe Colonial territories in fulfilment of our special responsibilities for them.    In certain exceptional cases,however, money has been made available to independent commonwealth countries from Exchequer sources.    There are various ways in which this form of investment in theCommonwealth is carried out.Colonial Development and Welfare16,     The Colonial Development and Welfare Acts provide finance for the Colonial territories in the form of both grants and loans mainly for public development programmes.    schemes approved year by year have reached the following totals:1953A      195*i/5       1955/6       1956/7 15. km.      15,3m.      29.8m.       26.0m.Actual expenditure, which bears no direct relation to figuresfor approvals in the same year, has been as follows:-1953A      195U/5       1955/6       1956/7(Est.) A. 1m.      16.1m.       16.9m.      18.8m.Sums unspent remain liabilities for the future.    Including thecarry over from previous Acts,   120 million,  or an average of 2ii million per annum,  is available for the period 1955-60.17o      A very wide range of work has been financed from colonial development and Welfare funds.    In the economic sphere therehave for example been schemes for the development ofagriculture, fisheries, forestry,  irrigation and soilconservation/
conservation;    roads and communications generally iaave been extended and improved.      There have also been numerous schemesfor research, mainly in the economic field.      In the socialsphere&apos;education, public health,  housing and water supplyschemes have been assisted and developed.      colonial development and Welfare funds have also been devoted to certaincentral services in the United Kingdom for the benefit of theColonies:    for example,  the Geodetic, The Topographical and the geological Surveys,  and the Colonial Products Laboratory.Some recent large grants include  1,500,000 and  3,450,000 forroads in Nigeria and  1+86,000 for roads in North Borneo; 1,200,000 for the improvement of African agriculture in Kenya; 1,300,000 and  500,000 for water supplies in Nigeria and mauritius;     1,516,000 for Higher education in Malaya and singapore;    and  1,200,000 towards a housing programme inBritish Guiana.      More than 4,000 schemes have been made sincethe Colonial Development and Welfare Acts started in 1945*Colonial Development Corporation18.    The Colonial Development Corporation is a public corporationestablished under the Overseas Resources Development Acts,  1948to 1956, for the purpose of assisting colonial territories inthe development of their economies.      For this purpose theCorporation has power to undertake in colonial territories,either alone or in association with private enterprise orColonial Governments, projects for the promotion or expansionof agricultural,  industrial,  and other types of enterprisesspecified in the Overseas Resources Development Acts.19*    The Corporation operates on commercial lines,  and has a statutory obligation to pay its way,  taking one year with another.      It has power to borrow up to  100 million on a longmedium term basis and to have  10 million of short termadvances outstanding at any one time.      In practice,  it borrowsfrom the Exchequer.      Total capital approved at 31st May 1957was  85 million and the Exchequer advances outstanding were 54 million,,
20o At trie end of 1956 the Corporation had 66 continuingprojects distributed functionally as follows:-Transport and communications 3.6%Capital in excess of  2 million had been approved for ten21.    In the Government&apos;s view the Corporation represents a useful supplementary source of capital to ordinary privateenterprise and has been able to make an important contributionto specific projects of Colonial development.      Through itsenterprise a number of valuable undertakings have been startedfor the benefit of the Colonies concerned which would otherwisenot have come into being.Export Credits Guarantee Department22.    Normally this Department provides guarantees to UnitedKingdom exporters to facilitate private United Kingdom exports and a very considerable amount of short term credit is made possible in this way.      In addition, under Section 3 of theExport Guarantees Act,  1949,  it has been possible for her majesty&apos;s Government to grant credits through the Departmentto other governments in very special circumstances, for thepurchase of United Kingdom goods and services.

Negotiations were concluded in 1956 for a loan of  15 million to India to finance the purchase of UnitedKingdom equipment for the third Indian Steelworks.      &quot;None ofthis has yet been drawn.Sterling Releases to the International Bank for reconstruction and Development23.    The United Kingdom Government announced in February, 1953that it would release sterling from its subscription to thecapital stock of the International Bank, up to a total of 60 million over six years,  as contributions towards Bank loans to development schemes in the sterling Commonwealth,     all commonwealth Governments in the sterling area who are membersof the International Bank are eligible,  together with colonial territories through the United Kingdom&apos;s membership and with aguarantee by the United Kingdom Government.      To qualify,schemes are required to show a reasonable prospect of helping the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments and of providing somescope for United Kingdom exports.      Releases authorised to theend of 1956 are shown in the table below.      Actual disbursementshave been somewhat less.1953   1954   1955   1956   Z195Z7*   TotalIndia (Iron and Steel: 5.0     1.0       -       3.0                       9.0electric power)Pakistan (Gas, electric -       6.9     1.8     0.1                       3.8power, paper, wharves)South Africa (Railways) -         -       9.0       -                         9.0Federation of Rhodesia -                           ICO                      10.and Nyasaland (Hydro-electric power)Total 5.0     7.9    10.8    13.1 36.8^/Note:-     If Indian Railway loan is publicly announced in time those figures ( 6,825,000) will be included//Total
Total Exchequer Funds21+.    The total amount of Government finance authorised or approved for expenditure from United Kingdom Government fundsthrough the channels (described in paragraphs 15-23) since thebeginning of 1953 has been:1953 195k 1955 1956 39.2m.      29.9m.       h0.7m.      65.6m.Whilst higher interest rates and tighter credit conditionsduring the past two years have reduced the scale of private investment (particularly through loans on the London market) thescale of actual expenditure of public funds has risen:195*1/55 1955/56 1956/57 (Estimate) 26.7m.  29.2m.  36m.These figures do not include the amounts which have averagedjust over  25 million annually during the last four years whichthe United Kingdom has provided in the form of grants and loans to support the administrations of Colonial territories which are either not viable economically,  or are facing some serious threat to law and order or the consequences of a natural disaster.ESTIMATED TOTAL UNITED KINGDOM CONTRIBUTION25.    It is estimated that the total of the United Kingdom&apos;financial contribution to development in the sterling Common-wealth has been about  150 million a year,  of which some 125 million has been in the form of private investment and loans from United Kingdom Exchequer funds,  and something under 30 million in the form of grants from the same source.      Inaddition,  investment in Canada has averaged over  30 million ayear.      The figures for the sterling Commonwealth are not, ofcourse,  the sum of the totals of United Kingdom private invest-ment and loans and grants from public funds given in theprevious paragraphs.      The figures of private investment arebalance of payments estimates and inevitably subject to a margin of error, whereas the figures for public funds are of disburse-ments over financial years.
26.    Nevertheless as some measure of the United Kingdom effort,it is possible to reach an approximate total from these figuresof average investment in the whole Commonwealth over the years1953/1956 plus the special assistance to various colonial territories referred to  earlier.      This total is nearly 200 million a year.      Set again at the average of our gross national product in that period this represents some 1^: per cent.,Put another way it represents between 7 and 8 per cent of ourgross fixed investment at home.      It has been unofficiallyestimated that in the ten years 19246-1955, 70% of the externalcapital invested in the sterling Commonwealth came from theUnited Kingdom, by contrast with 15% from the United States,10% from the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment,  and 5% from other sources./CHAPTER III
CHAPTER iii the UNITED KING-DOM&apos;S FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION IN THE FUTURE27o    In considering the future, it is necessary to set out &quot;briefly the factors which must determine a sound policy of overseas lending.The first requirement is an adequate flow of savings;    these mustbe sufficient to cover both internal investment and overseaslending.     But overseas lending requires in addition that the lender should earn the wherewithal to lend, in the shape of a surplus of external receipts over current external payments, andthe mere act of lending in no way automatically ensures this.Since the United Kingdom is, and has traditionally &quot;been, a centre for the investment of surplus funds from overseas, particularly of a short-term nature, overseas lending can be carried on for atime by the United Kingdom with an internal current surplus, butonly at the cost of increasing its overseas liabilities ordrawing on its reserves and thus imposing further burdens on the economy in the future.28.    It should be noted in this connection that the United Kingdomneeds to earn a sufficient surplus to oover not only the new capital which it makes available to the Commonwealth but alsoessential external investment outside the Commonwealth,  the repayment of foreign loans and any net withdrawal of fundspreviously invested in the United Kingdom itself.     Finally, thesurplus should also provide for the necessary increase in theUnited Kingdom&apos;s gold and dollar reserves.     The only surefoundation for all these capital flows is a surplus on the current balance of payments,  (i.e.  the United Kingdom should earn more bythe provision of goods and services overseas than it pays for itsimports, both visible and invisible),29.   At the present time United Kingdom industry is, as alreadynoted, now engaged on programmes of industrial modernisation andre-equipment which call for investment at home on a vast and increasing scale.     This will bring benefits to the commonwealth countries generally, both by increasing the demand in the United/Kingdom
Kingdom for their primary products and. &quot;by providing theadditional resources and modern capital equipment required &quot;bythem for their own industry and technological advance.     At sucha time of industrial expansion the maintenance of an adequate&quot;balance of payments surplus, requires particular attention tosuch matters as costs and prices at home, and also the fostering,in the world, as a whole,  of conditions favourable to theexpansion of trade.      Moreover, the increasing pace of economic development within the Commonwealth itself, which has already ledto the rapid drawing&quot; down in some cases of accumulated reservesinvested in the United Kingdom, imposes an additional strain onits economy and a limitation on the amount of additional commit-ments that, can he undertaken.30o    The economic policies of Her Majesty&apos;s Government must therefore &quot;be aimed at ensuring both an adequate volume of savingswithin the United Kingdom itself and an adequate balance ofpayments surplus on current account, as well as the creation of aclimate favourable to external investment in the United Kingdom,both long-term and short-term.      These policies.will continue tobe pursued with the object of providing a continued flow ofcapital from the United Kingdom, for economic development in theCommonwealth.      The propsect of any increase in the amount available depends on the success of our domestic policies designedto promote savings and a healthy balance of payments position.With these general considerations in mind, the following paragraphsexamine the prospects for the continued flow both of private andExchequer funds.PRIVATE FUNDS31.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government considers that it is through the investment of privately owned funds in the Commonwealth that theUnited Kingdom can and should continue to make its most valuable contribution to Commonwealth economic development.     The free flow of capital from the United Kingdom to the Sterling Commonwealth,and the liberal policy towards private investment in Canada, will/be
&quot;be continued.     Moreover,  substantial assistance will be given to overseas Trade Corporations by the provisions in the Finance Bill,1957. which will enable them to increase the amount available forre-investment overseas.     The relief granted under these provisions has been estimated at  35 million in a full year, andof this amount a substantial proportion should accrue to thoseOverseas Trade Corporations operating within the Commonwealth.32. /Her Majesty&apos;s Government has drawn the attention of theCeDaPjC.^0 importance they attach to its operations, andhas been assured that the Company would pursue its policy of continuing, and wherever possible expanding, its activities./33.    In Commonwealth countires without highly developed capitalmarkets, Local Development Finance Corporations can play a valuable part by providing capital for new industries,  and inattracting non sterling capital on a partnership basis0     Manysuch corporations have been set up since the war in variousCommonwealth countries with capital provided from local UnitedKingdom and foreign sources.      Her Majesty&apos;s Government believes that in economies where the conditions are suitable for suchcorporations, the United Kingdom can play a valuable part, notonly by the provision of capital, but also by providing personnelwith financial and other expert knowledge.EXCHEQUER FUNDS34.    In reviewed/ing future policy regarding the application of exchequer Funds to Commonwealth development, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom has considered its responsibilities in accordance with its varied relations with the colonial territories, the newly independent countries of the Commonwealth,and the older Commonwealth countries.      The Government hasalways recognised a special responsibility for the Colonies, andthis is the justification for its policy of applying Exchequerfunds to development in Colonial territories through such meansas the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts and the colonial development Corporation.      These matters are dealt with at greater length in paragraphs 38 to 2+2.
OD35.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government has also considered the special problems arising from the achievement of independence &quot;byColonial territories.     Their Governments naturally wish toemphasise their independence within the Commonwealth in theeconomic as well as the political sphere.     At the same time,because of the political and economic ties which bind theCommonwealth countries together, Her Majesty&apos;s Government retainsthe closest interest in their well-being and economic development.This is particularly true of newly independent countries.     Butthe special responsibility which Her Majesty&apos;s Government have for Colonial dependencies ceases when they achieve independence.The Government therefore does not envisage a general pattern ofGovernment to Government loans in order to assist newlyindependent countries in their early years.      The interests ofsuch countries can be better served if they have the fullestopportunities of building up their own credit and thus making useof the facilities for raising money on the London market or elsewhere.      Arrangements have therefore been made whereby the stocks of such Governments can continue to enjoy Trustee statusin the United Kingdom.      Nevertheless Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentrecognises that assistance to newly independent countries from united Kingdom Exchequer funds may be required in order to meetspecial and extraordinary needs.      If any such case were to arisethe decision v/ould be a matter for Her Majesty&apos;s Government indirect negotiation with the Commonwealth Government concerned,,36.    As regards the older Commonwealth countries Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment considers that,  given the limited resources available,the existing pattern of private investment in Government loans,private investment direct in productive enterprise,  includingthe special assistance which can be given through theCommonwealth Development Finance Company,  and the availablefinance for suppliers&apos; credits supported by the Export credits guarantee Department,  goes some way to meet the manifold needsof these countries.
37o    Her Majesty&apos;s Government intends that the uncommittedbalance of the United Kingdom&apos;s  60 million sterling subscriptionto the International Bank for Reconstruction and Developmentshall continue to he available for the purposes and on thebasis described in paragraph 23.Colonial Development Corporation380    It is the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government that theColonial Development Corporation should be able to continue,after a Colonial territory becomes independent, with projects in existence in that territory before independence, and ifnecessary to provide further capital in them, hut that for thereasons given in paragraph 35 it should not invest money in new schemes in any territory after independence.      In the viewof Her Majesty&apos;s Government this would he inappropriate for a united Kingdom statutory corporation, particularly one whoseessential purpose is the fulfilment of the United Kingdom&apos;special responsibility towards its own dependent territories,39.    At the same time. Her Majesty&apos;s Government recognises thatthe Colonial Development Corporation have acquired considerable experience and expertise in dealing with the problems ofcommercial-type economic development in under-developed countries.It would be happy to see the Corporation^ managerial experiencecontinue to be made available to any newly-independent commonwealth country, or indeed any Commonwealth country, which might desire toavail   itself of it.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government accordinglyproposes that the Corporation should be enabled, with the agreementof the Government of the independent Commonwealth country concerned, to undertake the management of any project on amanaging agency basis without commitment of the Corporationsfunds.      It will of course be for the Corporation to decide whetherit is able to meet any requests of this kind.ij.0.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government is satisfied that, in confiningitself to the purpose for which it was established, namely toassist in the economic development of the Colonial territories/for
for which the United Kingdom has a dix^ect responsibility,  theColonial Development Corporation has a task likely to require thefull financial resources available to it and there is still muchwork to be done in the Colonies.      The Government shares the corporations view that it will need additional capital over and above the total which it is at present authorised to borrow andwhich is already virtually committed in order that it may embark on further projects in Colonial territories.     The amount of thishas still to be determined and the Government is discussing this with the Corporation.IlI.    It is the Government&apos;s intention to give effect to theproposals set out in paragraphs 39 and 2+0 by the introductionof legislation as soon as possible to amend the Overseas resources development Acts, 192+8-1956.      The Bill to amend these Actswill also seek Parliamentary approval for an increase in the corporations present borrowing powers.Colonial Development and Welfare2+2.    The current Colonial Development and Welfare Acts runup to 31st March, i960, for the benefit of those territories which remain constitutionally eligible for Colonial development and Welfare assistance.      Of the total amount of  120 millionavailable for the five-year period from 1955/56 to 1959/60,  some 110 million has already been allocated to individualGovernments or central services.      Actual expenditure in theperiod to 31st March, 1957, cmourited to about S32+ million.     her majesty&apos;s Government will consider, nearer the material time,what arrangements should be made for the future.CHAPTER IVCONSULTATIVE AND CO-ORDINATING MACHINERY2+3.    Suggestions have been made at various times for the creationof new organs to handle economic development in the Commonwealth.For instance, proposals were made in a debate in the House ofCommons on 30th November,  1956,  that there might be a commonwealth development Agency and Bank,  each representative of all/independent
independent Commonwealth countries.     The first would hecharged with collecting and disseminating information aboutdevelopment potentialities and with determining priorities andthe second with the provisions of finance.      It was suggestedthat these bodies should he permanent and that the former should conduct a continuous appraisal of Commonwealth resources,LiL[.0    These ideas   have been considered carefully by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and other independent Commonwealth Governments,      Ingeneral all the Governments concerned, while recognising the needfor more capital for development, and while sympathetic to the motives which have inspired these suggestions, are doubtful oftheir practical value,h.5o    Since the United Kingdom is the only Commonwealth country which, is a net long term investor   abroad, a Commonwealth Bankcould do nothing to increase the total availability of capital for investment.      The United Kingdom is already exporting as muchcapital as it can.      So long as this situation lasts no purpose would be served by new machinery to augment arrangements which already exist.      Similarly a Commonwealth Development Agency whichwould lay down priorities for the Commonwealth as a whole would present insuperable difficulties for many Commonwealth governmentsof both a political and a practical nature.     The allocation of priorities in this way does not appear to he feasible.i+6.    Machinery has been in existence for many years for thepurpose of exchanging information and discussing policies oneconomic matters.     Apart from the normal channels forcorrespondence between Governments, operating through high commissioners, there are regular committee meetings on economic matters held in London, attended by officials from CommonwealthHigh Commissioners&apos; staffs.      These exchanges are supplemented by frequent visits between London and other Commonwealth capitalsby both Ministers and officials, and by close contact amongCommonwealth delegations at meetings of international economicorganisations.      It has also become customary for Commonwealth/Finance
Finance Ministers to take advantage of the annual meetings of theInternational Bank and of the International Monetary Fund to meet together informally for general discussion.     At the recent meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers it was agreed,  at the suggestion:of the Prime Minister of Canada that the meeting in September1957 should be held in Ottawa.     This will give a further occasion for discussion of economic opportunity;- among commonwealth countries.2x7*    There is also in existence the Commonwealth EconomicCommittee.     This Committee, whose office is in London, was established in 1925 and consists of senior commonwealth representatives.      Its functions are to provide economic andstatistical services on subjects affecting Commonwealth production,consumption and trade,  as well as to examine and report on any economic questions which member governments refer to it.      It isa valuable organisation for the collection and dissemination ofeconomic information useful to Commonwealth countries.2+8.    The future of this Committee was considered at the recent meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.      It was agreed thatthe Committee should be invited to examine and report to governments what expansion of its functions might usefully beundertaken.CHAPTER VTECHNICAL CO-OPERATION2+9.    In addition to the contribution to the economic developmentof the Commonwealth in the form of capital which is described in chapters II and III,  the United Kingdom augments the technicalcapacity of many Commonwealth countries in a number of differentways.      The United Kingdom possesses special advantages in this field on account of its large and varied resources, the close and long-standing industrial, financial and cultural links which exist between the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries andthe existence of a commonly understood language, which makes the interchange of ideas and methods relatively simple./Technical ...
Technical Co-operation in the independent Commonwealth50.    Ordinary trading connections provide the channel for thesupply of the hulk of United   Kingdom expertise to independent commonwealth countries in the normal course of commerce,,Moreover the United Kingdom is a natural field for recruitment of experts by Governments and private employers overseas,      Inthese ways constant contact in the technical field is maintained.In the case of independent Commonwealth countries in Asia, thesechannels are augmented through the Colombo Plan technical co-operation Scheme, and there is a special agreement with theGovernment of Ghana.     There are k,23h Commonwealth studentstaking courses at United Kingdom Universities and UniversityColleges in the current academic year.     The number at TechnicalInstitutes etc. is not precisely known but it is believed to beof the order of 2,000.Colombo Plan Technical Co-operation Scheme5*1*    Under this Scheme help is given by the United Kingdom,bilaterally to India, Pakistan and Ceylon and to foreigncountries in the Colombo Plan area.      Since 1S51, when the Schemestarted, up to 31st March, 1956,  some  1.5 million were spent bythe United Kingdom in aid to Commonwealth countries,  and some h00,000 for foreign countries.      In 1955 the United KingdomGovernment undertook to make available for the Scheme a total of 7 million over the seven years beginning in April 1956.      In thecurrent financial year it is aimed to spend  750,000 for commonwealth countries in Asia and  250,000 for foreign countries.The help given covers a very wide field, and is related to the varying requirements of the countries receiving it.     Advice isgiven by experts working temporarily overseas or by missions of experts.     Equipment for research and training is despatched bythe United Kingdom to other Colombo Plan countries where thisis appropriate.      Students are trained at Universities, colleges and by firms in the United Kingdom and there are 366 suchtrainees in the United Kingdom under the aegis of the Colombo/Plan
Plan at the present time      All this aid is given bilaterally;it is not centrally organised.The Federation of Malaya52.    At.present technical help by the United Kingdom Governmentto the Federation of Malaya is provided direct through theColonial Office and not under the Colombo Plan technical co-operation Scheme, but the Federation gets substantial helpunder that Scheme from Canada, Australia and New Zealand.     Onbecoming independent, the Federation will automatically qualify for help from the United Kingdom under the Sclieme on the same basis as India, Pakistan and Ceylon,  and arrangements to put thisinto effect are already in hand.Ghana53.    Under the new mutual technical co-operation scheme for Ghanaannounced on 2nd April,  1957,  officers nominated by theGovernment of Ghana from among their public servants will cometo this country at the expense of the United Kingdom Governmentfor training in technical and practical subjects,  and theGovernment will be ready to supply the Government of Ghana withexports to fill technical and scientific posts of a temporaryor advisory nature,  the cost of such experts being shared betweenthe two countries.Technical assistance for Colonial Territories5ho    The provision of technical assistance is an integral partof the general functions of the Colonial Office which is responsible for helping and guiding the Colonies In all aspectsof their development - political,  economic and social.      One ofthe most important of these functions is the recruitment ofpermanent staff of ail kinds for the various branches of her majesty&apos;s Overseas Civil Service and of special staff on contract.In addition to the normal functions of its administrative staff,which include a great deal of technical advice and assistanceparticularly in financial and economic matters,  the ColonialOffice has a large number of professional advisers on its staff/dealing
dealing with such subjects as tropical agriculture (includinganimal health, fisheries, forestry, pesticides, etc,) education,health,  labour,  social welfare,  co-operative societies, housing and engineering.     The advisory staff provide expert guidance onthe formulation and execution of policy in their respective fields,55,    The Colonial Office have a large number of advisory bodies.Two of these occupy a somewhat special position, namely theInter-University Council for Higher Sducaticn Overseas and theCouncil for Overseas Colleges of Arts, Science and Technology, inthat they are concerned with autonomous institutions of higher education in the Colonial territories and operate with a large measure of independence from the Colonial Office.     Their services will still be available to the institutions with which they arerespectively concemev! after the territories in which thoseinstitutions are situated become independent.56.    In the field of surveys and scientific research the mainfacilities provided by the United Kingdom for the benefit of colonial Governments comprise the Directorate of OverseasGeological Surveys,  the Directorate of Overseas (Geodetic andTopographic) Purveys and the Colonial Products Laboratory,The results of work done for Colonial Governments by these bodies can also be made available to independent commonwealth governments in certain circumstances.      There are also a numberof specialised advisory committees dealing with various branchesof research, notably with Colonial agricultural and medical research and research on Colonial products.     The ColonialAgricultural Research Committee works in close co-operationwith the Agricultural Research Council of the United Kingdom, andthe Colonial Medical Research Committee advises the ColonialOffice and the Medical Research Council jointly.      There is alsoa Colonial Research Cotincil which advises the Colonial secretary on genei*al questions relating to research policy in the Colonies,co-ordinates the work of the various research committees, andadvises on any research matters not falling within the province of any of the other committees.
57o   Among the valuable non-Governmental services which theUnited Kingdom provides,  often through the Colonial Office orthe representatives in London of Colonial Governments,  is the placing of students in universities,  technical colleges andother training centres in this country.      The authorities concerned have shown their realisation of the importance ofthis matter by making available an ever-increasing number of places for Colonial students.      The number of students in theUnited Kingdom doubled between 1952 and 1956 and is now about12,000,  the two largest groups being nurses (over 3,000) and engineering students (1,295).      In the aggregate these servicesrepresent a very great contribution to the development of theColonial territories.The future of Technical Go-operation58.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;believes that in the field of technical assitance the United Kingdom must continue to make a major contribution to the development of Commonwealth resources.They will continue to take a full share in the Colombo PlanTechnical Co-operation Scheme,  and believe that the sum of 7 million which it will make available during the seven yearscommencing in April 1956 is sufficient to meet probable require-ments from member countries of the Colombo Plan during that period.59.    The Government will be prepared to make appropriatearrangements for technical assistance to newly independent countries, as has already been done for Ghana, to the extent thatthey are not covered by any existing schemes or by broadlyequivalent arrangements planned before independence.      The UnitedKingdom Government hopes that other Commonwealth Governments, withthe necessary resources, will make their own arrangements for technical assistance with newly independent members of theCommonwealth /and that in the course of time it may be possible toform these into wider organisations on a Commonwealth basiSjJ7Canada, Australia and New Zealand already extend help to theFederation of Malaya under the Colombo Plan.
60.    The existing Colonial Office services will he required formany years to cater for the needs of dependent territories.     TheUnited Kingdom Government will make available to newlyindependent countries at their request advisory services of the sort which they have received in the past.     In providing such assistance, the United Kingdom Government can draw upon a wide variety of experience from its Departments, nabionalisedcorporations and private enterprise.     The provision of technical assistance of this sort to independent Commonwealth countries in asia (including the Federation of Malaya) can ordinarily hefinanced from funds voted for use under the Colombo Plan technical co-operation Scheme./CHAPTER VI
CHAPTER vice-OPERATION IN THE FIELD OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE51.    Of all the technical advances which have been made in thisgeneration, the one fraught with the greatest promise is thedevelopment of nuclear science.    It is clear that atomic energy will play an increasingly important part in the economic development of the Commonweal.th.    In this field the UnitedKingdom is more qualified than any other country to give assistance.62.    A number of Commonwealth countries are already obtainingadvice and technical aid from the United Kingdom underbilateral arrangements in accordance with their differing needs and the varying stages of development in this field.    Indeed,training facilities in this country and advice on technical problems are available within the limits of the resources ofthe United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority for any commonwealth country which seeks them.    Conversely the United Kingdomreceives important assistance from other Commonwealth countries.Canada53*    The Canadian and United Kingdom atomic energy projectshave grown up together.    Sir John Cockcroft was Director ofthe Canadian Research Establishment at Chalk River in its early days.    There is a continuous exchange of views and of visitorsbetween the Authority and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, andthe Authority makes use of facilities afforded by a Canadianresearch reactor for some of its experiments.   A contract hasrecently been completed for the delivery of Canadian uranium tothe value of $115 million over the period 1958-1962.Australia6k.    The Authority and the Australian Atomic Energy commission have been in close contact from the start over the setting upof an Australian atomic energy project.    The AustralianCommissions Chief Scientist and a number of the Commissions/staff
staff have spent some time working at Harwell.    A number of australian scientists are still there,    A high flux researchreactor similar to DIDO at Harwell is being built in Australia.The United Kingdom is providing much of the finance for thedevelopment of Australian uranium production,  and when the full production of present mines is achieved will be buying a large part of the output.South Africa65.    The South African atomic energy research programme is stillin a comparatively early stage but a number of visits have been undertaken by representatives of the South African Atomic EnergyBoard to the United Kingdom, and by representatives of theAuthority to South Africa, to discuss various aspects of theprogramme and the ways in which the Authority might assist in it.The main emphasis of South African effort so far has been on themining and extraction of uranium, of which the country isamongst the world&apos;s biggest producers, and a substantial quantityof this production f ind.s its way to this country.    A substantial proportion of the capital to develop the facilities for theproduction of uranium has been subscribed by the United Kingdom,and technical help has also been given.India66,    The Authority assisted, the Indian Department of atomic energy in the design and construction of a &quot;swimming pool&quot;research reactor and have supplied the fuel.    A scientist fromHarwell has been seconded to assist in the establishment of radio-chemical laboratories in India,    The Authority and theDepartment of Atomic Energy concluded an Agreement in 1955providing for co-operation and mutual assistance, under whichIndia has received advice and information in connection with her programme.Pakistan67.    An Atomic Energy Commission has been established in pakistan in the last year.    Discussions have been held with/ the
the Authority as to ways in which we can help to build up the pakistan atomic energy project.    A number of Pakistaniscientists have been trained in the Authority&apos;s establishments,and arrangements for further training are in hand.    TheAuthority are advising the Commission on organisation and on the siting and equipping of laboratories.Other Commonwealth Countries68.    The Authority set up an office in Salisbury, at the end of1955 to encourage prospecting for uranium and other atomic energymetals in the territory, and lias published offers to buy, onstated terms, uranium found in the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland.    Recently an East African Office has been established at Dodoma in Tanganyika.    A geologist from the Authorityrecently visited New Zealand to survey possible deposits there and geologists from the United Kingdom Geological Survey havealso visited New Zealand, Ghana, Sierra Leone, British Guianaand Jamaica on behalf of the Authority.    The Authority has alsosupplied scientific equipment on loan to Colonial GeologicalSurveys to encourage the search for uranium.    Radio isotopesneeded for medical, agricultural and industrial purposes havebeen supplied to those Commonwealth countries which require them,including some Colonial territories.    Doctors and research workers from Colonial territories have attended courses at the Authority&apos;siBotope School.    Colonial Governments are all kept informed ofthe trend of developments in the field of the peaceful usesof nuclear energy.The future of co-operation in the field of nuclear science69.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom will, aspart of her contribution in the field of technical assistancesgive all possible assistance to other Commonwealth countriesincluding the Colonial territories in developing atomic energyto meet their individual requirements.    For example, the UnitedKingdom can provide extensive training facilities, if necessary,in basic science and technology as well as nuclear subjects./Most
Most courses in universities, technical colleges and. hospitals in this country are open to all Commonwealth students, and anumber of institutions now run special courses on aspects of nuclear energy.    The Atomic Energy Authority does its best togive priority to candidates from other parts of the commonwealth in its own schools.70.    Atomic energy can find a practical application at an early stage in most Commonwealth countries through the use ofradioactive isotopes, for which the necessary skills can be acquired fairly quickly and little heavy expenditure oninstallations or equipment is needed,    Radio isotopes havewidespread application in the treatment and diagnosis of disease(where they supplement or supplant X-rays), in industry, and inthe improvement of agriculture through new research techniques and in other ways.    The Atomic Energy Authority and other bodies,such as the Medical Research Council, are very ready to give advice on the scope for radio isotopes in any country and to helpin the choice of equipment, etc.    The Atomic Energy Authority cansupply most isotopes commercially to any part of the world.The development of isotopes techniques would appropriately be thefirst object of any training programme in nuclear subjects.71 .   Commonwealth countries intending to establish an atomic energy project of their own (e.g. a research laboratory) canlook to the Atomic Energy Authority for help on the organisation to be adopted and the objectives and programmes to be set, andfor advice on the design of laboratories, on the selection of equipment (including research reactors), safety precautions,the disposal of effluent, and so on.72.   The Atomic Energy Authority can give expert guidance, froma fund of practical experience that is at present unique, on theapplication of nuclear energy to the generation of electricity.In most Commonwealth countries, however, the immediate needfor nuclear power as an economic alternative to coal, oil orhydro-electric power, may be limited.   At present, because of./the
the high capital cost of installation, nuclear pov/er iscompetitive only where demand is high and where the reactor canbe run continuously at our near peak load.    This rules out any but industrialised urban areas.    Reactor designs for small scale electrical power generation have not yet been fully testedunder commercial conditions, but work is proceeding on certainsystems which offer prospects of commercial application wherethe costs of conventional power are relatively high.73.    Places at the Atomic Energy Authority&apos;s schools, and atcourses run by other institutions,  are normally paid for by thestudent or his sponsors.    But help in financing trainingin this country, and the secondment of United Kingdom staff,  canbe given in suitable cases to independent Commonwealth countriesin Asia and to Ghana under our technical co-operation arrangements with them.7h.    Her Majesty&apos;s Government propose to arrange for this meeting to be held immediately after the 1958 United Nations Conference on atomic energy.    Its purpose would be to show the Commonwealthdelegates the work being done at the various United kingdom atomic energy establishments and to provide an opportunity fordiscussion of their particular requirements and of recent developments in the atomic energy field relevant to their needs.It would be complimentary to and not in any way a replacement of the day to day exchanges of information and advice which arealways going on.75.    At the recent meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers a review was made of the progress of co-operation within theCommonwealth in the application of nuclear energy for civil purposes.    Commonwealth Ministers agreed on the growing importanceof the contribution which nuclear energy can make to the peacefuldevelopment of Commonwealth countries and of the rest of the,world and on the value of close collaboration between Members ofthe Commonwealth in this field.    It was agreed that for thispurpose nuclear scientists from Commonwealth countries should beinvited to an informal meeting in the United Kingdom in 1958*/CHAPTER VII
CHAPTKl VII - CONCLUSION (Re-draftof 8th. July)76o   Trie object of this paper is to pure the achievementsand future pattern of United Kingdom investment in theCommonwealth into proper perspective..   The problems whichall Gommonv/ealth Governments are facing in financing then-&apos;respective development programmes are frankly recognised in the final Communique of the Prime Ministers&apos; Conference;!In their general review of economic questions the Commonwealth Ministers gave special attentionto the Impact of the major programmes of development on which many of their countries are now engaged.These programmes call for high levels or domesticsaving which can only be seemed by sound internalpolicies.   But they also call for condition.;-favourable to investment from other countries.   TheUnited Kingdom v.ill continue to play its leadingrole in furthering economic development in thecountries of the Commonwealth, and importantcontributions are also being made by other Common-wealth memberso   But, in view of the continued needfor capital investment, it is also important toencourage investment from other sources on suitableconditions.;iWhatever funds may be forthcoming from outside, nothingcan provide an effective substitute for the efforts of commonwealth countries themselves and, if the UnitedKingdom is to play a leading part in this field, it mustshape its policies accordingly.   This means that as a country and as individuals we must save more.   We mustmodernise our industry and extend our resources of paver.We must pioduce more at prices which are competitive.   Wemust sell more abroad.   There will be occasions when wemust forgo some desirable development at home in order tomake money available for prudent investment elsewhere inthe Commonwealth.   V.e must be unremitting in our determination to create a stable economic climate, which/will
will not only enable the United Kingdom to undertake its share in Commonwealth development, &quot;out will also attractsupport from elsewhere.   All this will nou be achievedeasily or in a short period or time, but upon our ultimatesuccess largely depends our own future and that of the..:ouimonwealth as a major force in world affairs.77.   during two great wars the United Kingdom poured outthe accumulated savings of generations in the defence ofthe free world.   It suffered heavy damage to its industrial equipment, to its cotmnunications and to its trade,   wegladly acknowledge the generous help received from ourfellow members of the Commonwealth and the United Statesduring the period or re construction, lout the UnitedKingdom on its side can claim that, besides the greatexertions undertaken to rebuild its own industry andfortify its economy, it has made a major contribution ofcapital and technical skill for the economic e pansionOx the post war Commonwealth.   Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentare determined that this should be continued by all themeanj in its power.
