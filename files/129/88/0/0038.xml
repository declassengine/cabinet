Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1957SECRET    : Copy No. 57C. (57) 188  jfyth August, 1957CABINETEUROPEAN FREE TRADE AREA: AGRICULTURENote by the Secretary of the CabinetI circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet a note prepared by officials ofthe Departments concerned on agriculture and the European Free Trade Area.(Signed)        NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,23rd August, 1957,Note by OfficialsIf we are to succeed in negotiating an industrial free trade area, it will be essential that some parallel arrangements should be made in respect of foodstuffs.The attached report discusses how far, within the limits of present policies and commitments, it might be possible for the United Kingdom to offer to undertakeobligations in respect of foodstuffs of a general or &quot; institutional &quot; character. the suggestions in paragraph 24 of the report are intended to show the full extent ofwhat could be proposed within existing commitments. We make no recommendation as to whether this proposed &quot; solution &quot; should be adopted asa whole or in part.2. It may turn out that an acceptable free trade area is not negotiablewithout going beyond the limits set by this &quot; solution.&quot; Further study is accordingly being made of this aspect and a further report will be made on, e.g.,the possibility of concessions on imports of specific agricultural commodities;detailed assurances concerning our agricultural import policy; and arrangementsfor majority voting in institutions for agriculture.3. The meeting of Ministers in the Organisation for European economic co-operation (O.E.E.C.) in mid-October is the earliest occasion on which an indication of any change in our present attitude towards agriculture in relation tothe free trade area should be given to other European countries. It may well provedesirable that any detailed indication of such a change should be withheld beyond that time, and in any case we would suggest that in our initial approach to Europewe should not go beyond the institutional proposals in the present paper. It will of course be essential to consult the Commonwealth in advance of any statement in O.E.E.C., and it would be desirable to give some general (but not detailed)indication of the trend of United Kingdom thought at the forthcoming meeting of commonwealth Finance Ministers.4. In these circumstances no final decision need for the present be taken onthe substance of our policy towards agriculture and the European Free trade area; but Ministers are asked to give their provisional view whether, or how far,the possibilities set out in paragraph 24 of the attached report can be regarded as acceptable in principle, and so provide the basis of further work at the official level.23rd August, 1957.52118b
REPORT on agriculture&apos; AND THE&apos;&apos; EUROPEAN FREE TRADE AREAPurpose of Submission0 1 It is vital to success in negotiating an industrial free trade area that some&apos;parallel arrangements should be made in respect of foodstuffs. This paper showsbroadly how far the United Kingdom could go in the &quot; institutional &quot;field withinthe limits of existing policies and commitments. But it may not be. possible within these limits to offer enough to secure an acceptable free trade area. A second paper will, therefore, be submitted designed to ascertain what other steps, if any, ministers might be prepared to take. ,   ;   .-.Why a Move on Agriculture is Necessary2. That an industrial free trade area cannot be negotiated without somearrangements for foodstuffs has emerged plainly in all the discussions we havehad at official and Ministerial levels with the Six Messina Powers and most otherMembers of O.E.E.C. Where we have not had these bilateral discussions, e.g., inthe case of Greece and Turkey and Iceland, the desire of the countries concerned to provide for the inclusion of foodstuffs is well known. While Switzerland sharesour views in this matter, she is convinced that we shall have to do something aboutagriculture to gain acceptance of an industrial free trade area.,.; 3.   The two basic reasons for this are -(a) Continental foodstuff exporting countries cannot justify to their own publicopinion and legislatures opening their markets for industrial goods(which account for 95 per cent, of United Kingdom exports to O.E.E.C.countries) while the United Kingdom offers no quid pro quo onfoodstuffs (which account for a varying but substantial percentage ofthe exports of most of them to the United Kingdom-details are givenin Annex A).(b) Apart from their interest in the United Kingdom market for foodstuffs,some O.E.E.C. countries outside the Six are concerned to safeguardtheir interests in the markets of the Six. For Denmark this is vital.But while these are the basic difficulties there will be many undertones, detailsof which are given in Annex B.4. Annex A also shows the importance of foodstuffs in trade betweenO.E.E.C. countries. For five of them it represents 60 per cent, or more of exportsto other O.E.E.C. countries, and in the case of Denmark 73 per cent.; and of danish exports of foodstuffs 32 per cent, go to the Six.Treaty of Rome5. There is no question of exposing European agriculture to free trade, nor ofeliminating all Governmental financial support for it. This is not contemplated ordesired by the Six under the Treaty of Rome any more than by other members ofO.E.E.C., with the possible exception of Denmark. It is true that the Treatyprovides for the gradual removal of tariffs and quantitative restrictions on trade infoodstuffs (as on trade in other goods) between the Six. But, at least for the transitional period of up to 15 years, other methods of protecting national marketswill be used for many, but not necessarily for all, foodstuffs. By the end of the transitional period the Six intend to have established a common agricultural policy,backed by a common system of market organisation, which may take the form(depending on the product) of (i) common rules governing competition notexcluding the possibility of free trade, or (ii) co-ordination of their national systems of market organisation, or (iii) a single system of market organisation. Any measures necessary to the achievement of the common policy&apos;s aims may be used includingprice regulation, subsidies, and stock and carry-over systems or common devicesfdr stabilising imports or exports, so long as they do not entail discrimination withinthe.Six.&apos;. . i&apos; 6. It is impossible to predict the practical outcome of these arrangementsby the Six, in view of the various pressures which will be exerted both within thegroup and from outside it. It is. however, unlikely that the general level of support
which the Six by various methods eventually give to their agriculture will be outof line with what the United Kingdom would think right for herself, though therewould be important differences of method and detail. And it&apos; may be that the six will achieve little which would not just as well and just as quickly have been achieved by the present method in O.E.E.C. of &quot; Confrontation of agriculturalpolicies.&quot;  But the United Kingdom could not rely on these possibilities.The Problem7. The problem of agriculture in the free trade area negotiations is quite different from that of industrial goods, since in the case of the former (though not of course the latter) the retention of some protective arrangements form part of theplan. It follows from this, that the essential task is to discover what new arrangements for foodstuffs can be agreed upon which on the one hand wili bepresentable politically to all concerned as an adequate complement to an industrialfree trade area, and on the other will safeguard the special interests of, e.g., the danes in the markets of the Six.8. The problem for the United Kingdom is how far we must resign ourselves to, or participate in, such arrangements in order to ensure that we do get a free trade area for industrial products. The United Kingdom can tackle this problem by the &quot; institutional approach &quot; or by the &quot; specific concession approach &quot; or by a combination of the two. At one extreme, the former involves the setting up of aninstitutional framework which may mean subscribing to certain general objectives and in due course lead to developments over the whole or any part of theagricultural field of a significant though unforeseeable kind, but which involves no current specific concessions on particular commodities. At the other extreme,the latter approach involves making specific concessions on specific commodities(as it were paying for an acceptable free trade area in hard cash down), but avoidsfuture liabilities the extent and nature of which cannot be defined.9. From a negotiating point of view, if on the institutional approach we could accept in full the agricultural provisions of the Treaty of Rome with its objectives,tariff and quota elimination, and majority voting, there would be no need to makeany specific concessions in the course of negotiations. This might also be the case if we accepted the agricultural provisions of the Treaty subject to a waiver for theUnited Kingdom on tariff elimination for goods in which our European partnerswere satisfied there was a significant Commonwealth interest. At the other extremethere would be very strong pressure on us to make specific concessions if all weoffered in the institutional field was consultation on the existing O.E.E.C. model.There are many possible compromises between these two extremes, the criticalpoint for us probably being the extent to which we are prepared to acceptlimitations on our freedom to determine our own agricultural policies.Scope for Manoeuvre10.   On present policies our room for manoeuvre is strictly,limited:(a) In the White Paper (Cmd. 72) Her Majesty&apos;s Government affirmed their view that foodstuffs must be excluded from the proposed free trade area. - .   .   &quot; /   s    -     - -    i -(b) Ministers have undertaken &quot; to ensure the preservation in full of Common-wealth interests in the export of foodstuffs to the United Kingdom &quot;,interests which are very far-reaching.(c) The terms of the Agriculture Act, 1947, are such that Ministers could not properly commit themselves to a reduction in the level of price guarantees over a period of time; and the Agriculture Act, 1957, notonly sets limits to the annual reductions that may be made in the guaranteed prices for individual commodities, but also prescribes aminimum for the total value of the guarantees and production grants in any one year. * The 1957 Act applies indefinitely, but the currentlimits could be changed if the Government so decides in-five years&apos; time.(d) The Government has frequently stated and has recently reaffirmed thatthe tariff is the proper means of protection for home horticulture, asa counterpart to the price guarantees under the Agriculture Acts.(e) There is the comparable political, and to some.extent economic, difficultyof touching the modest tariff on fish and some fish products.52118
Courses open     . ......11. The discussions that have&quot; taken place in, O.E.E.C. pn ;thegeneralframework of possible arrangements for agriculture have made very little progress.They have not really got beyond1 indicating; that the highest common factor on- which there ^nay-be general agreement %; that some further &quot; concerting &quot; of1. agricultural policies is -required&apos;.&apos; - The&apos;pressure oh- &quot;us from the food exporting countries-Age^erallyV arid: the Six as a body, will be not merely to agree to consult;ab6ut arid justify our agricultural policy (as wedb already), but to commit ourselvesalsb to act in the eomhibri Eurbpeari interest with safeguards for our own interest no greater than are retained by the Europeans for theirs. &apos;-.,;,fi, 12.. ./We. have,examined what might be possible without conflict with present:,United^-Kingdom policies-referred to at paragraph ,10 above.   Three kinds ofarrangements can be envisaged:  (1) Arrangements; for agriculture including the dismantling of tariffs, parallelto the industrial free trade area, under which those countries who, , wished could associate with the Six on the terms of the Treaty of Rome.::. ,,&apos; The United Kingdom could not join.(2) Arrangements .which provide for consultation about all aspects ofagricultural policy and protective measures internal and external but which involve no commitment to modify policies save by unanimousvote. These arrangements would be supplemented by a firm agreement to abolish, tariffs and quotas over the years binding on all participantsV except that the United Kingdom would have a waiver in respect of alltariffs;.. ...(3) Arrangements.as in (2), but with no commitments to abolish tariffs and.r,j -.. quotas, coupled with the provision that countries could seek to associatetogether (including with the Six) in differing degrees and for different-    : ^commodities.   The United Kingdom would express its willingness toconsider association in particular cases as and when definite proposals were worked out.&apos; 13.:&apos; (1) above would, in effect, be an extension of the agricultural provisionsof the Treaty; of Rome. It would, if it were negotiable, solve the problem of denmark, but we cannot think that sour mere willingness to stand aside would; satisfy,the Six,, pr,other O.E.E.C countries. If this were the system adopted, weshould have to Jbuy our ^exclusion at a high price in terms of concessions on specificitems-a price /which. would probably be higher than our existing policies wouldpermitrus ,tq;pay capd rwhich would probably involve damage to commonwealth interests as well. Such a solution would also deprive us of any opportunity we might have, if...we were associated with the arrangements, of influencing their development along: liberal lines and of safeguarding the interests of theCoirimoriwealth. It should be borne in mind that the Six have already refused toallow Denmark to adopt this course in relation to them.,;.,   14.   Under the second arrangement ((2) above), there would be a statute for. agriculture providing for general consultation about and mutual justification of rail aspects of agricultural policies, but with unanimous voting. This in fact; amounts to np more,than we are already committed to in O.E.E.C.  There wouldalso be a general provision for elimination of tariffs and quotas over the years.This would secure the position of Denmark in the markets of the Six.  So far asthe United Kingdom is concerned the removal of quotas over the years wouldprobably not be&apos;a very serious problem.  Nearly all the quotas on imports fromO.E.E.C. countries have already been removed.   Apples and pears and warepotatoes would present real difficulties but the few remaining quotas on other&apos;&apos;!comri1odities could probably be&apos;remoyed without&apos; difficulty.  (Details are given in annex C.) As regards action on tariffs, there would have to be a waiver for theu&apos; United Kingdom - to &apos; safeguard, Commonwealth interests; and a similar waiver-^-l^biild^b^^gce^saty^ iri,torder1&quot;to maintairi the5horticultural tariff/ A waiver to5 Safeguard&quot;CommbtiWealth preferences iri cases where the Europeans were satisfiedof a significant Commonwealth interest should1 not&apos;create serious difficulties in negotiation; .a horticultural waiver would.  This proposition also would be-^wtfa^Cive^ tb^tbd^aiiels/&apos; Inasmuch as; all who&apos; joined (save the United Kingdom);:would aceept^these^defiriite bbligatibrisain respect of all foodstuffs, the propositionmight the Six, but since the United Kingdom would-&apos; be- offering rib mdre!tKan ebrisultatioh plus; miribf quota concessions, there! would
probably still be a high price to pay in terms of specific concessions, if not &quot;so great as under the first alternative, &apos; :?ivotcvt(&apos;..;:rt15. Under the third arrangement ((3) above) there would again be a statute for agriculture on the lines of that described in paragraph 14, but with a framework for association with the trade arrangements of the, Six.; - It would be open toother members of O.E.E.C. to join, or not to join, in the arrangements for each particular commodity. The arrangements could lead to, but would not providefor, rules for tariff and quota elimination and such methods as might be evolvedto regulate the other measures of protection that would take their place. Sweden,for example, might join in the arrangements for wheat but not in those for meat.We would affirm our willingness to consider association in particular cases (subjectto our commitments to the Commonwealth and to home producers) as and whendefinite proposals were worked out.16. Such an arrangement would not of itself give definite assurance to the danes that they could maintain their position in the markets of the Six, nor would it satisfy the other exporters of foodstuffs outside the Six since there would beno obligation on the Six or the United Kingdom to co-operate. If feasible at allit would have to be negotiated by us with the Six and presented to other countriesmore or less as a fait accompli; and it would probably mean that Denmark wouldhave to join the European Economic Community in full. But it would be difficultto negotiate with the Six since they would be unlikely to accept the associationof other members of O.E.E.C. in respect only of the commodities that suited thelatter unless reciprocity were forthcoming in other sectors, for example,harmonisation of legislation or funds for investment. It would also be an untidysolution providing as it would for a whole series of tariff clubs which would create difficulties with non-members and in the General Agreement for Tariffs andTrade (G.A.T.T.). If arrangements on these lines were to have any chance of being negotiated, it is most unlikely that the United Kingdom could avoid, as the price ofsuccess, making significant specific commitments as well.17. Either (2) or (3) could be supplemented by the adoption of agreed rules for trade in agricultural products similar to those to which we are already committed in the G.A.T.T. and the O.E.E.C. This might have sqme presentationalvalue.18. We talked to the Commonwealth early in July about agriculture ingeneral terms with which the development of arrangements in (2) and (3) wouldnot be inconsistent. They showed no signs of shrinking from such a move, though no specific proposals were discussed: we shall have to continue to keep them very closely informed. .19. We must satisfy as far as we can the desire of the Six to go, beyondconsultation and towards a common agricultural policy, but if, as is the assumptionon which this paper is based, we are to avoid a departure from present policies inrespect of the preservation of the Commonwealth interest in our market, thesupport of our farming economy and the protection of horticulture, then we cannotundertake prior commitments to act in common with Europe or enter intoinstitutional arrangements under which we might be forced to act in conflict withthese policies. The above examination of the possibilities set out in paragraph 12shows that the furthest we can go on this basis by way of participation in general arrangements for agriculture is:  id) Consultation about, and confrontation and justification of, agriculturalpolicies. r(b) Endorsement of a general commitment to eliminate quotas and tariffs overthe years, with a waiver for the United Kingdom, 4n, respect, of tariffs(paragraph 14 above). ) k(c) Arrangements for association indiffering; degrees by va,serious countries andfor various commodities with the Six, the United Kingdom bejng willingto consider in particular cases whether we would in fact,,associate(paragraph 15 above). ....-/)   , y ,20. In spite of their limitations, one of these, or a combination of all three,must be the kernel of any United Kingdom offer consistent yvith our /existing policies. In result they may have to be supported by concessions on specificcommodities,..the nature of which are not considered in ; thjS)-paper.,nBut quite52118 b 3
apart from this, they could be supplemented by other general undertakings of varying substances and presentational value.

21. Whatever combination of these policies we decide on must be presented to Europe in a way designed to make it look new and attractive. It might be thought desirable to set up, in connection with the free trade area, institutions for agriculture which are overtly aimed at securing more definite results than the present arrangements. The Swiss have suggested that there should be a Ministerial Conference "with vague and generally laudable objectives." A possible idea might be to set up an independent "Commission" of advisers whose advice could be considered by Governments, though without commitment.

22. There would also be scope for agreeing to study whether when and in what cases voting by a qualified majority might be appropriate in due course. For instance, though within the limits of current policy the United Kingdom could not accept any form of majority decisions, one could envisage majority voting on recommendations. This would involve the United Kingdom and all concerned in exposing themselves to greater presure than could arise so long as the unanimity rule prevailed, and might go quite a way to meet the Continental desire for something more than consultation. The implications and possibilities of accepting majority voting within the limits of existing policies are being further examined.

23. Europe recognises that our policy on imports of foodstuffs is liberal and we have taken great care to emphasise this. But against the background of firm commitments in the industrial sphere Europe naturally asks what guarantee is there that our policy will remain so. We could perhaps give a general assurance that we intended to accord to the agricultural exports of free trade area members treatment no less generous than we do now. How much weight this would carry would depend on the degree of precision we were prepared to give to it. Some of the possibilities are positive undertakings by us:-

(a) That it would not be an objective of our policy to provide by our support arrangements a bigger share of the United Kingdom market for the United Kingdom producer than he has already.

(b) To bind tariffs at their existing levels.

(c) Not to impose quotas to a greater extent than we do at present subject to an escape clause for balance of payments difficulties.

We are examining these possibilities further, although it is difficult to see how any such undertakings could be given within the limits of existing policies.

"Solution"

24. In sum, we could offer the following within the framework of declared policy:-

I. A "Statute" for agriculture, separate from the Free Trade Area Convention, but negotiated and signed simultaneously with it in O.E.E.C., covering:-

(a) Arrangements for consulting about, confronting, and justifying policies, but with no powers of enforcement.

(b) Rules for trade in agricultural products-lifted out of the G.A.T.T. and O.E.E.C. resolutions.

(c) The elimination of tariffs and quotas on foodstuffs over a definite period.

(d) Institutional arrangements of a more positive character than the existing agriculture committees of O.E.E.C.

(e) Institutional arrangements to provide for association in differing degrees with the Six.

II. The United Kingdom for her part could:-

(i) affirm her full adherence to I (a) and (b);

(ii) affirm her acceptance of I (c) subject to a waiver for herself on all tariffs;

(iii) state her agreement to I (d) on the understanding that the institutional arrangements would provide for unanimous decisions (though we could possibly be ready to consider majority voting on recommendations and other matters not
resulting in binding decisions on Governments we are examining this question further);(iv) affirm her willingness to consider in particular cases (subject to hercommitments to the Commonwealth and to home producers)association under I (e) as and when definite proposals were.worked out;(v) make as helpful a statement as possible on United Kingdomdomestic agricultural policy of which an essential feature wouldbe an undertaking not to increase uneconomically the UnitedKingdom&apos;s share of her own market.25. The foregoing suggestions, if they were adopted, would have some bearing on the question whether or not Overseas Territories should be excluded from thefree trade area.   We are considering this question further.Conclusion26. This paper is intended to set out the broad possibilities within the limits of existing policy and commitments. Ministers are asked to consider these possibilities. In so doing they will wish to bear in mind that, while apart fromelimination of quotas the United Kingdom would be entering into no new commitments, over the years the pressures which might build up might be veryconsiderable and might lead the United Kingdom ultimately to modifyconsiderably its existing policies. It is impossible to forecast the outcome of thesepressures and developments. The &quot; institutional approach &quot; has advantages in political presentation in the United Kingdom, because there are no definitecommitments. In the long run, however, getting entangled in such arrangements might have a significant effect on our agricultural policy and our freedom to change it.ANNEX AExports of O.E.E.C.

ANNEX CUnited Kingdom Quotas for FoodstuffsApplesThere are no quantitative restrictions on imports from Sterling Area sources.For North America there is a quota of  1^ millions for the period 16th November,1957, to 30th June, 1958, of which not more than  300,000 may be used up to31st December. For O.E.E.C. and certain other countries the quota is  3 millions for the twelve months to 30th June, 1958, of which not more than  ^ million maybe used from 1st July to 31st December. Quotas for imports from other non-sterling sources are also given as part of bilateral agreements, but are notsignificant in total, except that Argentina has a quota of  650,000 for apples andpears, of which about  J million is used on apples.2. Quantitative restrictions were imposed, and are still justified in theG.A.T.T., on balance of payments grounds. In pre-war days the bulk of supplies were obtained from the United States and Canada. Since then there has been alarge increase in European production. If the restrictions were removed forO.E.E.C. countries parallel action vis-a-vis North America would be necessary;and the cost to the balance of payments might be considerable. Our own production of dessert applies has, however, been greatly increased since before thewar, and the restrictions are protective in effect. When they can no longer bejustified on balance of payments grounds the interests concerned have been promised by Her Majesty&apos;s Government a full opportunity before the restrictionsare removed to discuss what arrangement may then be necessary in the light ofthe circumstances prevailing at the time. The National. Farmers Unions (N.F.U&apos;s)would then seek some arrangements which would offer an equal degree ofprotection during the United Kingdom season. To devise any such arrangements would be very difficult. The alternative of a high protective tariff would not onlydetract from the value of quota removal for Europe, but would, owing to the &quot;no new preference &quot; clause in the G.A.T.T., raise the difficult issue of Commonwealthfree entry. Furthermore, the duty free entry of apples during the United Kingdomseason is bound to the United States under the G.A.T.T. and renegotiation of this concession would be costly. The N.F.U&apos;s would no doubt claim that a solution would have to be found before we could commit ourselves to a removal of the quota for O.E.E.C.ANNEX BThe Need for Negotiations on Foodstuffs: Additional considerartions the Danes and the Dutch will want complete assurance that our domesticsupport policies will not be such as to lessen their share in our market. Havingbeen virtually driven out of the United Kingdom egg market they fear that thesame may happen with other commodities such as bacon and cheese. Indeed, inreturn for the free entry of our goods into their market they could reasonablyseek an opportunity of gaining a larger share in this market. Their main foodexports are bacon and pig products, dairy products, eggs and (in the case of holland) fruit and vegetables.2. The Dutch, the French and the Italians will want a larger share in theUnited Kingdom market for horticultural products. Apples and. pears are atpresent protected by quota. The rest are protected by a tariff which in manycases rises to a fairly high level during the peak season of home production. Inthis field it is clear that the tariff will be under attack.3. The French, Italians and Portuguese will also be interested in the wineduties. The French have said that they want to secure some abatement of whatthey regard as the protective element in our health regulations.4. Norway, Iceland (and to a lesser extent, Denmark) will be concerned toensure that some arrangements are made to cover fish and fish products. the norwegians have said that they want fish products put together under free trade area rules.5. The foregoing are pressures upon us. But the non-Six agriculturalexporting countries particularly Denmark are no less concerned to maintain their exports to the Six. Within the Six the Dutch, the French and the Italians hope, atthe expense of the rest of the world, to get a larger share of the German market.
Pears3. For Europe there is a quota of  1-4 millions from the 1st July, 1957, to30th June, 1958, of which not more than  1-2 millions may be used from 1st july to 31st December. Canada has had a quota only when pears were, included in our programme of Mutual Aid from the United States, which was not the case this year.4. For pears the position is very similar to that for apples. In pre-war days the United States was the major source of imports, but our own production hasmore than doubled since before the war. The restrictions are justified on balanceof payments grounds, and their removal would cause the same kind of difficulties as would arise in the case of apples.Ware Potatoes5. The United Kingdom is normally self-sufficient in ware (main crop)potatoes. Whereas the market for new potatoes is protected by the seasonal tariff,ware potatoes enjoy assistance by price guarantee under the Agriculture Acts.When home production is sufficient to supply demand at reasonable prices noimports are permitted. If there is a shortage imports are freely licensed. It couldbe said that, in effect, this is a minimum price system, but its terms are determinedsolely by the United Kingdom.6. The great difficulty about removing import restrictions is the risk of severe loss to the Exchequer while the present system of price support operates for domestic production. Under present arrangements the Potato Marketing Boardpurchase from farmers all ware potatoes offered to them which they cannot sellabove the support price and the Board pay the farmer this support price. these purchases are taken off the market for human consumption and generally disposedof at a low price for animal feeding. In 1956 the Potato Marketing Board hadto purchase about a million tons in this way, and the net loss was about  12 millions.No imports were allowed. If unrestricted imports were permitted the Board wouldin effect have to purchase not only all potatoes surplus to United Kingdomrequirements at the guaranteed price but also would be providing a floor price for exports from Europe, which are in some cases subsidised. In these circumstances the cost of price support could be greatly increased. Thus the retention of import restrictions appears inevitable for as long as the price guarantee for ware potatoescontinues.Bulbs7. The import of bulbs is subject to quantitative restriction, the principalquota being  3-2 millions for the Netherlands. The restrictions are necessarypending the introduction of either a tariff quota, which would require legislation,or an agreement on prices between the Dutch and United Kingdom interests,subject to this being legal under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act. Therestrictions could not therefore be removed without some difficulty.Processed Milk8. Imports of processed milk products are subject to quantitative restriction and the present quotas for O.E.E.C. total over  1 million. Their removal wouldbe of value to Denmark and Holland. If imports were free this would tendto depress the price at which liquid milk for manufacture is disposed of in theUnited Kingdom with the risk that payments from the Exchequer under the priceguarantee would be increased, but the extra cost would be relatively small.Sugar-Containing Goods9. Imports of sugar-containing goods are subject to quantitative restrictions,which have survived for balance of payments reasons since the end of State trading in raw and refined sugar. The main quotas for O.E.E.C. countries are for chocolateand sugar confectionery ( 4 millions) and are not fully taken up. The quotas for all sugar-containing goods could be eliminated without difficulty.Meat10. There are quantitative restrictions on the import of meat from the dollar area and Iron Curtain countries. There is no effective restriction on imports fromthe main traditional sources of supply or from Europe, excepting for some kinds of pig meat. The Ottawa Agreements provided that the United Kingdom market
for Commonwealth meat would be safeguarded if necessary by preferential quotasin addition to duty free entry. The G.A.T.T. does not preclude our having quotasto establish Commonwealth preference, but looks to the elimination of any suchquota preferences, or their replacement by tariff preferences. If we acceptedan obligation which would mean that we could not impose quotas on imports from europe, we might have difficulty with the Commonwealth, who do not considerthat a tariff preference is a satisfactory alternative to a quota preference. TheCommonwealth is much more concerned, however, about competition from theArgentine than from Europe, but they would perhaps be uneasy as a matter ofprinciple about the acceptance by the United Kingdom of the removal of thesequotas. ,Summary11. In short, for the three major items (apples, pears and ware potatoes)where the removal of quotas would be of considerable importance to Europeanfood-exporting countries very considerable difficulties stand in the way of ourcommitting ourselves to the removal of restrictions. Where the quotas could be abandoned without difficulty, or with little difficulty, (processed milk, sugar-containing goods and meat) the value of the concession to Europe would not be great. On the other hand it is, however, necessary to remember that a programme for the elimination of tariffs and quotas in the agricultural field would extend overmany years and it may be that the difficulties in the way of removing import restrictions on apples, pears and ware potatoes will grow less with the passageof time.
