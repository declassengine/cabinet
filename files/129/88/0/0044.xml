M.10 Downing Street, S.W. I.1st September, 1957.
InflationI. There are two theories about the inflation. One is that it is a &quot; wage pushinflation &quot; caused by the power of the Unions to demand ever-increasing wages.The other is that it is a *&apos; demand inflation &quot; too much money created in the attempt to do too many things at once.This is like the argument as to which came first, the chicken or the egg.The protagonist of the first view is Harrod and of the second Lionel Robbins.Both sides agree that there is not enough production, but they give differentreasons for it. The Harrod school say that there is not enough production, thatovertime is not being worked, that men are kept idle in the factories because thereis not enough money in the system therefore they want to pump  1,000 millioninto it. Robbins and Co. say that production is not rising sufficiently because, with labour over-sold, the tactical position of the men is too strong; and they hint thatworkmen never work their best unless they are subject to some discipline. So theRobbins school would reduce the amount of money, in order to reduce the pressure on the labour market.(The thing that is interesting about the Harrod school is the proposal to pumpin more money by reducing taxation. There is a lot to be said for this; but it is really another argument, as to whether taxation is in fact deflationary orinflationary.)II. The economists may argue; we have to decide. The facts are that the   isweak, although the balance of payments is not bad. Costs are rising all the time,and there is a sense of frustration, amounting almost to despair, among certainclasses of the community, who do not believe the Government have either theknowledge or the courage to handle the problem, and while the great mass of thepeople have never &quot; had it so good &quot; there is a growing feeling that if the situationis allowed to drift too far, it may end in disaster. It therefore becomes not aneconomic but a political decision as to what we are to do. We should read theeconomists and take some advice from the Civil Servants; but we must decide for ourselves.III. What is the climate in which we have to make this decision? It is surelythis. The Government, gravely shaken by Suez, has just managed to maintain itsequilibrium over the last seven or eight months, partly by courage and loyalty fromits members, and partly by the failure of the Opposition to press any attack home.Nevertheless, the Conservative Party cannot approach the next election with any confidence, for two reasons. Since the first Reform Bill it has been very rare forthe same Party to win even two elections running, and to win three is almost amiracle. Secondly, while the great mass of the working population and themajority of the entre-preneur class have gained from the inflation, those who havebeen injured by it are disproportionately represented in the Party organisation inthe constituencies.IV. What then are we to do? There is a wide feeling among our own supporters that the thing to do is to have a row with the Trade Unions. But that is
merely an instinctive reaction of a class of people who resent the depression of theirown standards at the time when the standards of so many people are rising so\ rapidly. There is no object in having a row with the Unions per se; and if theeconomic and monetary situation is left unchanged you might have a splendid row and even win but you would be no better off afterwards. We would have dealtwith the symptoms, not the cause of the disease. As G. K. Chesterton used to say,it is like trying to cure chicken pox by rubbing out the spots. To challengea demand for more wages by a series of strikes is like King Canute trying to keepback the tide if (as seems to be the case) the demand for more wages is carried forward all the time on the rising tide of an ever increasing demand for labour.V. The Trade Union leaders are divided into the extremists, who want tomake trouble; and the moderates, who want to do their duty by their memberswithout injury to the general economy of the nation. But all Trade Union leaders,although they call themselves Socialists, are in fact just the same as any othermerchant in capitalist society. The commodity which they control is labour. Thedemand for labour is greater than the supply. Therefore, like those who controlany commodity in such a situation, they cannot do anything except put up theprice. Indeed it can be argued that the Trade Union leaders have been verymoderate in exploiting their economic opportunities. Many people in similar circumstances would have raised much more the prices of the commodities whichthey controlled. So I think many Trade Union leaders say that they cannot help us, much as they would like, until we can stop the flow of the inflationary tide.If we can even get slack water, or still better a slight ebb, their task would bemuch easier.VI. It seems clear therefore that while there is a great deal to be argued,on a purely theoretical basis, as between the different points &quot;of view of theeconomists, the only practical thing to do is to reduce demand. This can onlybe done by reducing the total volume of money which comes into the system.How is this to be done? We must deal with both categories, money that is createdon public account and money that is created on private account. It would notbe politically possible, even if it were desirable, to put the pressure on one withoutputting at least some pressure upon the other. So far as the ways of reducing thevolume of money on private account are concerned, there are various technicalmethods open. It is not worth arguing about them until we decide that we are going to do this anyway. Only then does it become necessary to choose themethod. It also becomes much easier. There is the liquidity ratio method (verypopular in Fleet Street), and there is the more straightforward method of a direct control of bank advances (probably preferred in the City). If money created bythe banks at the present time is x, what we have to do is to say that all the moneythey can create next year is 9/10, or I, or -f of x, or whatever &quot; the authorities &quot;decide.So far as the public sector is concerned, there is nothing very substantialto be squeezed out as regards current expenditure. We have got rid of most ofthe subsidies, and I do not think we can get much out of health services, welfare services and all the rest.   Defence we must certainly hold at  1,450 million, and
if we can make bold answers to the three questions which the Defence Committeehas posed:  (a) the atomic requirements of the Army,(b) the role of the Navy,(c) the air defence of Great Britain,we may get considerable savings here. In (c) particularly there is very big money.Of course on current account we must squeeze what we can. But the lemonis pretty dry. Therefore the only way on the public sector is in &quot; below the line &quot;expenditure not the squeeze but the elastic. Five-year programmes must becomeseven-year programmes, and in such a way as to take the pressure off the first year or two.VII. If both these things are done and the quantity of money entering thesystem is reduced, it should be possible to maintain the present structure of our economy. When electricity came into domestic use, some clever man invented thefuse that is an artificially weak place, a point in the circuit which would &quot; blow &quot;if too much pressure were put on. Had it not been for that, whenever the pressuregot too great we would have had to tear up the walls and the floorboards. the trouble with our economic system is that we have no fuse. We are trying to keepfull employment, high rates of investment and expenditure and a fixed value ofthe  . The only thing therefore that can play the role of the fuse is prices. Shorttherefore of going on to a floating exchange rate (which may be desirable on other grounds at the right moment) the only method is to reduce the pressure to put lesspower upon the circuit.VIII. If therefore the Government decides to do this, it should be donequickly. It has the great advantage that nobody will really notice it very much.The total volume of bank advances will affect many people of course, but not inthe same way as cutting down their teeth, or spectacles, or wages or welfare milk,or all the other forms of economy. The Banks (and the Bank Managers) will preferan arbitrarily imposed level to the &quot; old boy &quot; method of the &quot; credit squeeze.&quot; Thepulling out or &quot;re-phasing&quot; of the school building or other capital investment programmes may be a matter of great public debate, but will not affect the daily lives of many people, for they hardly notice these things. Nor are we fortunatelycommitted to anything like the 300,000 houses. This was like a game of cricketwith a monthly score board which either had to be reached or failure registered.But these great capital investment programmes of hundreds of thousands of poundsto which we are committed are more flexible.IX. But there is a great prize to be politically gained, apart from the economic or social aspects. If we can steady prices by reducing the pressure we shall gainenormously, and if we can do it in such a way as to make unemployment stillnegligible 2 to 3 per cent. we shall lose no votes and injure nobody. What weshall do is to prevent firms holding on to labour for whom they have no real work,which they now do because labour has been for so long such a scarce commoditythat it is hoarded.  It may result in inferior labour getting less reward, and higher
rewards to better labour. That is all to the good. It may result in a strugglewith the Unions, but that struggle will be under conditions when it will be worthwinning, for we shall be in slack water or the turn of the tide. It will certainlyresult in strengthening the hands of the moderates like Tom Williamson againstthe extremists like Cousins.There is a further prize. Although I have in this paper broadly adopted the Robbins view, I think there is a great deal in what Harrod says and there aretwo points where I think the austerity of the conventional deflationary methodsshould not be allowed to be paramount. Since they are very important I will deal with them in a little detail.The first is taxation. If we take the bold step of controlling or reducingthe volume of money there is really no need to have such a big surplus above theline. It is of course necessary to secure that the total volume of savings of allkinds throughout the nation is enough to finance the new investment programmes,public and private. But there is no virtue in trying to achieve this by a Budgetarysurplus above the line (which is supposed to be absolutely orthodox if it is preciselyequal to the capital expenditure below the line, and at least meritorious if itapproaches this ideal). For if we are doing the job by the measures proposed bothin the public and the private sector, there is no reason to use the Budget surplus todo the same thing. I have always disliked the theory that the Budget should be&quot; an instrument of economic policy.&quot; After all, the House of Commons came into being for one purpose only, to grant to the Crown &quot; subsidies &quot; (now called supply)necessary for meeting the expenditure of the Crown in any given year. The newtheory is a creation of Cripps and the economists. In any case if we do it in one way we need not do it in both ways; so there is the great prize that we could, as our contribution to reducing the cost of living, knock  400 or  500 millions offtaxation. The second question is the cost of money the Bank Rate. If we reducethe volume of money by direct controls (for that is what the plan is), there is no need to use indirect controls. It would be foolish to combine the old system with thenew. When I was Chancellor of the Exchequer I was persuaded to use the orthodoxweapon, the Bank Rate. But that was at a time when we did not control in any direct way the volume either of public or private expenditure on capital account.If we are using the measure of quantitative control, what is the purpose of a highbank rate? None whatever. So far from raising it, it should be reduced, and thereby you gain in three ways. You gain on the exchanges, you gain on theBudget and you gain politically.X. If we are going to act we must act soon. Pressure on the pound will develop in the course of September when there will be a lot of talk at Washingtonabout deflation. We must act quickly and boldly. In any case our only hope ofsuccess in the next two years is to be bold. An Opposition can drift along withoutany particular plan and hope to gain by the weariness or unpopularity of theGovernment of the day. A Government that has been six years in office and hasbeen subjected to the severe stresses from which we have suffered can only regainits equilibrium by courage and originality. At the same time these measures, whichwould seem in a sense restrictive, must be balanced by the creative themes of
closer union with Europe upon the one side and Canada upon the other.  If wecould hit all these marks, stability of prices and strength of sterling at home, andgreat openings of trade in Europe and. Canada, we should have a fine and worthwhile^programme.  Above all and that is vital for an Administration in our position we should have recovered the initiative.
