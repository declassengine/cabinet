Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 18026th July, 1957CABINETNATIONAL INSURANCE benefits memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and National insurance in accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on 23rd July (C.C. (57)56th Conclusions, Minute 5) I set out the administrative implications of a decisionto bring improvements in National Insurance benefits into effect before Christmas.2. I append a time-table of the action required for the different stages of theoperation.3. From this it is clear that it is an essential condition of the operation thatfirm decisions be taken as to the rates of all benefits, pensions and contributions by early August.4. I have assumed for the purposes of this paper that it would not be possibleto take the Second Reading of the necessary legislation before 12th November,when the debate on The Queen&apos;s Speech will be concluded, though it might bepossible formally to introduce the Bill for the sake of securing its publication duringthe last days of October.5. The Cabinet will see from a comparison between these dates and those setout in the time-table that these assumptions involve both a public announcementcalling on pensioners to bring in their pension books to National Insurance offices for over-stamping, and the return of these books with the new rates stamped in inrespect of a period subsequent to 17th December, at a date before Parliament hashad an opportunity even to give the Bill a Second Reading.6. Whatever Parliament did or said it would in practice be impossible to payafter 17th December rates of benefit other than those put in the books in advanceof Parliamentary authority. It would, of course, be possible to vary them somemonths later, but during the interim period we should in fact be firmly committed to the rates on which we had decided.7. It would, therefore, be apparent from the beginning that we could not accept any amendment in respect either of rates of benefit or contribution or ofdates of operation.8. It would also be apparent that Parliament need not have been put in this position if we had either taken the Bill this summer or recalled Parliament in themiddle of October.9. I should add that the time-table in the appendix allows the minimumpossible time for the operation of uprating about 5 million pension order books aswell as a million or so other benefit claims. This time-table, therefore, allows no margin at all for the effects of any epidemic. An epidemic would not only depletethe staff of my 900 local offices in which the uprating of pension order books has tobe carried out but greatly add to their work at the same time in dealing with sickness benefit claims. Adoption of this time-table, therefore, involves the acceptance bythe Government of some risk of a breakdown of the operation in the event, forexample, of Asian influenza developing this autumn. It is fair, on the other hand,to point out that the normal epidemic period in this country comes after Christmas;though the week before Christmas is the Post Office&apos;s peak period of the year.51974

10. If Parliament passed without variation the proposed rates (to which wehad committed ourselves) before the operative date, no abnormal extra-statutorypayments of benefit or under-collection of contributions would arise. If, however,&quot; things went wrong &quot; and Parliament was unwilling or unable to pass the legislationunaltered or at all before the operative date, there is a risk that we should have tomake extra-statutory payments on an unprecedented scale, in order to keeppensions in payment at all. There is also the point that the Public accounts committee have in the past called attention to what they regard as a departure from financial regularity in incurring expenditure before it has been approved byParliament in the present case the point of criticism would be expenditure on thework of uprating.11. I have consulted the General Post Office and the Stationery Office and Iam told that the four months&apos; period given to me as necessary for the printing anddistribution of the twenty-seven varieties of new stamps is a firm one.12. As I told the Cabinet on 23rd July an operation of this sort, if made without preliminary announcement, is also quite certain &quot; to leak.&quot; The most likely early source of the leak will be the work on the war pension increases. Inview of the enormous variety of rates of war pension in issue (they vary, inter alia,with both assessment and rank) it would be necessary by mid-August for myNorcross office to start the work on the individual documents of some f millionwar pensioners. To do this involves informing a very large number of staff,including very many junior staff, of the precise new rates. As some of these willbe, as they always have been, the same as the rates of National Insurance benefit,it is unrealistic to suppose that these will not become generally known. There isa further risk from the advance printing of stamps and order books. So far as Ican see, a leak would develop by early September, if not earlier. government spokesmen who are asked to confirm or deny that arrangements are being madefor changes in benefit rates will be in a position of some difficulty.13. While, therefore, it is clear that if decisions on rates and contributionscan be taken in the immediate future, and my colleagues are prepared to face the risksabove indicated, we can as a matter of administration bring new rates of national insurance benefit into operation in the week beginning 17th December (with warpension changes a week or two earlier), it -is also clear that two political questions will have to be resolved. One is whether we can face the criticism which wouldbe aroused, by the rough treatment of Parliament, involved in making theannouncement referred to in paragraph 5, of the calling in of books, with itsimplication of quite irrevocable decisions before the Second Reading of the Bill.The other is whether we are prepared to face the fact that our intentions to make these improvements will leak gradually into the Press and public mind rather thanbecome known to the public as a result of a Government announcement. Mycolleagues will appreciate that both these points could be met if we were preparedto bring back Parliament earlier in October than is contemplated and to make anannouncement of our intentions within the next few weeks.J.
