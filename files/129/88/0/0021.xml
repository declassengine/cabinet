THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 17118th July, 1957CABINETDEVELOPMENT AREASMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade on 4th July the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, to give consideration to the possibility of the Government retainingownership of factories in areas which were de-scheduled and exercising the functionsof a good landlord on the analogy of the Crown Estate (C.C. (57) 49th Conclusions,Minute 7). We have found a temporary solution which does not commit us to introducing new legislation in the near future.2. I am advised that it would be possible under the Distribution of IndustryActs for me to continue, after de-scheduling, to maintain the factories previouslyerected in the de-scheduled areas. Although the Act does not enable the Boardof Trade to continue to provide extensions for tenants in these areas this could beundertaken without special legislation immediately. Money for this would have tobe provided by Vote of Parliament separately from the provision which is made for expenditure under the Distribution of Industry Acts. This could be done as atemporary expedient; I would not contemplate it as a permanent arrangement.3. Looking further ahead the factories could be transferred to a variety of bodies acting on behalf of the Government. My own preference is for theorganisation which the Minister of Housing and Local Government proposes to setup to operate certain new towns. Legislation would be needed to lay down theconditions under which the new body was to operate; but we could consider thislater.4. I therefore propose, if my colleagues agree, to announce in parliament that certain areas no longer appear to justify retention on the Schedule and thatthe necessary consultation with local authorities will be put in hand. A draft statement is attached with which the Chancellor of the Exchequer is in agreement.D. E.Board of Trade, S.W.1.18th July, 1957.51922
DRAFT STATEMENT ON DEVELOPMENT AREA policy. Under the Distribution of Industry Act, 1945, the Board of Trade, actingjointly with the Secretary of State for Scotland where an area in Scotland isconcerned, may by order remove an area from the Schedule of Development Areaswhen they are satisfied that the distribution of industry in that area is such thatthere is no longer likely to be a special danger of unemployment. Similarly, areasmay be added when it appears to the Board of Trade that such a danger is likelyto arise.2. The Government now believe that, in the light of current economic circumstances and their assessment of the future, retention on the Schedule of several areas at present included can no longer be justified. They consider,therefore, that there is now a prima facie case for removing East South Wales,Wrexham, Merseyside, South Lancashire, the southern and western parts of theNorth-Eastern Development Area outside the coal field, the part of the WestCumberland Development Area outside the principal coal and iron ore miningarea, North Ayrshire and South Lanarkshire and Sanqhar from the Schedule.These are all areas from which the Government believe that the special threat of serious unemployment has been successfully eliminated.3.  The Government propose also to add North-West Wales to the Schedule.4. Consultation has taken place with the Minister of Welsh Affairs abouteach of the changes affecting Wales.5. Consultations will accordingly be initiated with the local authorities concerned, as required under the Act, with a view to the necessary order being submitted later to Parliament.6. No final decision has yet been taken about the future of Government-owned factories in areas removed from the Schedule. Meanwhile, the Board ofTrade and the various Estate Companies will continue to manage them as atpresent.July, 1957.
