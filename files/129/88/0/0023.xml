THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1957SECRET Copy No. 5C. (57) 17319th July, 1957CABINETCOTTONMemorandum by the Chairman of the Economic Policy CommitteeThe Economic Policy Committee have been giving further consideration to theproblem of the effect on Lancashire of the growing imports of cotton goods from india, Pakistan and Hong Kong which was before the Cabinet on 14th March(C.C. (57) 20th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. It will be recalled that the Lancashire industry were advised bySir Anthony Eden to attempt to negotiate a voluntary restriction of exports tothis country with the industries of India, Pakistan and Hong Kong, and that thisnegotiation raised the question of whether Her Majesty&apos;s Government would beprepared to police any such arrangements by imposing quota restrictions on theimport of cotton goods from those countries. It appeared, however, premature to reach a decision on this latter point when the Cabinet considered it in March,and the Lancashire mission were encouraged to proceed with their negotiations.3. The Indians have from the start been forthcoming in this matter, providedthat suitable controls could be established at this end and provided also that similar arrangements could be concluded with Pakistan and Hong Kong. Duringthe negotiations with Pakistan, however, there was an announcement that HongKong would accept no limitation of her exports and discussions were suspendedat this point. Pakistan had suggested that there might be a combined quota whichthe three countries could compete to fill. This proposal would be unacceptable to Hong Kong and there is no indication that it would be acceptable to India.4. The Cotton Board have now asked that Her Majesty&apos;s Government shouldpublicly support further discussions between the industries to arrive at an agreedmaximum figure for imports into the United Kingdom. If we agree to do this we shall be expected to agree to police the agreed quota by import licensing.5. It seems plain that an import control by the Government is the only reallyeffective way of enforcing a voluntary agreement for the restriction of exportsof Asian textiles. We might save ourselves the embarrassment of an announcementimplying ultimate willingness to impose import licensing, if the industries could now voluntarily agree upon a &quot; peril point&quot; at which they recognised that their total exports might constitute a grave threat to United Kingdom employment:they and the Governments concerned would agree that when this point had beenreached immediate consultations should take place between Governments. Butthis or any variant which does not rule out the possibility of Government actionto limit imports of cotton goods would involve a decision of principle now bythe Government that they would in certain circumstances be prepared to imposequantitative restriction on Commonwealth goods. And it would not, of course,follow that the Hong Kong industry would agree to take part in discussions orin an agreed statement on these lines.51924
8. The Hong Kong textile industry has so far refused to agree to any arrangement involving restriction.of their exports to the United Kingdom. It hasbeen suggested that a voluntary agreement would be in her ultimate interests,provided that the agreed limit for her exports was put at a reasonably generouslevel. The Colonial Secretary has, however, argued that Hong Kong&apos;s position isa special one on these two counts:  (a) The effect of restriction would be serious on her economy.  Our strategic controls on trade with China have enforced a switch from entrepottrading to manufacturing in Hong Kong. Once such restrictions were imposed on her exports of cotton goods, even to implement a voluntary agreement, there would be increasing difficulty in defending the positionof Hong Kong manufacturers in the United Kingdom and in commonwealth and foreign markets.(b) For these reasons no such agreement could in fact be a voluntary one onHong Kong&apos;s part. To persuade we should have to press, taking advantage of our special position in relation to a dependent territory.We intend-in the general Commonwealth interest and in accordancewith the obvious wishes of the Europeans as well not to allow HongKong to pursiie her desire to enter a Free Trade Area with Europe.6,  The arguments in favour of the action proposed by the Cotton board are:  (a) Imports are rising: from 128 million square yards of Indian grey cloth in1956 to no less than 104 million square yards for the first half of 1957(though the rise in the case of Pakistan and Hong Kong is not so rapid):If we take no action after the encouragement already given to theindustry to negotiate an agreement, we shall run the risk of completeloss of. confidence in the Government in Lancashire.(b) It is for general consideration whether it is right to expose a major home industry to unrestricted competition from Asia whose costs are basedupon lower living standards.(c) To implement a voluntary agreement for the limitation of exports to thiscountry by the mechanism of import licensing would be quite a different matter from the imposition of quantitative restrictions in default ofagreement: both this and the still more awkward issue of a tariff would thereby be postponed.(d) Free entry for Commonwealth goods is not an inviolable principle: thereare already certain fields in which British industry is protected from commonwealth competition and our agricultural subsidies have thesame effect.7.   Against must be set:  (a) The present position of the Lancashire industry is far from desperate. Ithas been contracting steadily for some time past, but there is no significant unemployment in the area.(b) The Free Trade Area will involve us in admitting European textiles intothe United Kingdom free of duty and without restriction. We should then be put in the position of giving Europe an advantage over theCommonwealth in the United Kingdom market.(c) The imposition of a quota to enforce a voluntary agreement must appeara serious departure from our traditional trading policy of using import restrictions solely for balance of payment reasons. This has quiterecently led us to refuse quantitative restrictions on the import of argentine chilled meat in order to favour the Australian and NewZealand producers. Such a departure would weaken us in challengingin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) and elsewhere the use by other countries of quantitative restrictions for other thanbalance of payments reasons and would be embarrassing in the context of our current negotiations for a European Free Trade Area.(d) We should soon be under pressure to extend such arrangements for thebenefit of other industries in this country, which are (or may in thefuture be) just as seriously affected as the cotton industry by competition from Commonwealth countries in Asia.
18th July, 1957.We should now in effect be imposing on her measures from which, ifimposed by another country in similar circumstances, she would beentitled to ask for our protection in the G.A.T.T., as in fact she hasalready done in respect of German restrictions on her exports of rubberfootwear.9. These conflicting considerations have prevented the Economic PolicyCommittee from reaching a conclusion on the best course to pursue in this matter,It was agreed that I should refer the issues to the Cabinet on their behalf.P.
