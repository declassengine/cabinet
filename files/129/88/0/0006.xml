(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 1562nd July, 1957MANCHESTER^ HOUSING NEEDSMemorandum by the Lord chancellor the Minister of Housing is under obligation to reply to the manchester City Council about the representations made to his predecessor and himself that Manchester cannot solve its housing andslum problem unless it is permitted to develop a large site outsideits own boundaries but under its own control.    On 24th June the cabinet agreed in principle to Manchester being told that, if they made a planningapplication to him for one or more such sites, the Minister would dealwith it by arranging an inquiry into Manchester&apos;s housing needs, to be conducted by a person independent of his Department (C,C.(57) 47thConclusions, Minute 2) .    The Cabinet invited me, in consultation withthe Minister of Housing and the Minister of Agriculture, to frameappropriate terms of reference for such an inquiry and to make recommendations regarding its composition and character.2.        The Minister of Housing and Minister of Agriculture concur in the recommendations that follow.3.        The inquiry should be a public local inquiry held under theTown and Country Planning Act,1947.    An inquiry under the 1947 Actcan take the widest form.4.        It is recommended that the person holding the inquiry shouldbe asked to cover in his report the following subjects:-(a) a realistic assessment of Manchester&apos;s likely requirementsof housing sites in the years immediately following 1960;(b) the fullest extent to which these requirements can bemet within the City boundaries;(c) the degree to which sites outside the City will be needed in those years;   and(d) the manner in which the latter need can mostreasonably be met, having regard to all relevant factors,including the importance of Manchester being able tomaintain a steady and adequate rate of housebuilding, andalso of avoiding (or postponing as far as possible) the taking of good agricultural land.It will be made clear that the inquiry is into the facts;  and theperson holding it will not be asked to make any recommendation whether,COPY NO.CABINET1-
in the light of the facts, the particular planning application or applicationsput forward by the C;ty Council should or should not be granted.    Thiswill be for the Government to decide, when the report is available.5.       Although reports of Inspectors holding inquiries under theTown and Country Planning Act 1947 are not normally published, andthe Franks Committee is considering amongst other matters whetherpublication is desirable, it would seem necessary in the specialcircumstances of this case, that the factual report should be published;and that this should be made known when the decision to hold an inquiryis announced.6.        In our judgment the type of person who would be best qualified to hold the inquiry and would be likeliest to command the fespect ofall concerned is an eminent Q.C. with experience of inquiries upon local government matters and also of land use problems in country aswell as town.    If the Cabinet agree with this view, I shall be happy toassist the Minister of Housing in finding a suitable individual;  Iunderstand that the Minister of Housing for his part is anxious thatthe person chosen shall be acceptable also to the Minister of Agriculture.K.Lord Chancellors Department, S.W.1.2nd July, 1957.
