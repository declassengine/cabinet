INFLUENZA VACCINEMemorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of HealthA vaccine for use against the Asian-type of influenza is now-being commercially produced by two firms.    Supplies will be limited and are unlikely to be sufficient for more than about half a millionpersons (two injections) by the end of the year.    There are possibilitiesof imports but not of large quantities.2.     In America the vaccine is being handled on purely commerciallines with plans to persuade the population to seek vaccination on a large scale, mainly at their own expense.3.      The Asian-type of influenza is highly infectious but mild in character.    It may be expected to reach epidemic proportions inEurope in the winter and cases are now occuring in this country.    Thereis on present evidence no medical, necessity for general vaccinationagainst so mild a disease and on past experience, the protection givenby this type of vaccine does not usually exceed 30 per cent to 40 per cent.4.      There will, nevertheless, be a demand for a product which willbe in short supply.    There are three possible courses:(1)     To allow the vaccine to appear on the market whenit will be purchased by various organisations fortheir employees (both manufacturers wish to havea supply available for this purpose) and also be prescribed by doctors under the National Health Service.(2)     To recommend to the manufacturers that they shouldsell their output to &quot;essential&quot; undertakings.(3)     To arrange some Government sponsored schemeof vaccination.5.     The Committee under the chairmanship of Lord Cohen, whichadvises the Health Ministers on mass immunisation, has recommendedthat they should acquire sufficient vaccine to ensure the continuanceof the essential health services in an epidemic by vaccinating hospitalstaff, general practitioners and local health authority staff who visit the sick in their homes.    Such persons number about half a million and, if vaccination were generally accepted, would require the wholeoutput of vaccine up to nearly the end of December.    At an average price of 5/- per dose,  250,000 would be required to meet the cost ofvaccine.COPY NO.secret.(57) 1977th September, 1957CABINET
6.      General practitioners and other domiciliary visitors to the sick are clearly at exceptionally high risk of infection;  hospitals areclose communities in which infection could spread rapidly and jeopardise the whole service of caring for the sick.    Public opinion would belikely to support these priorities, and it is doubtful, whether, in thetime likely to be available, any system of vaccination of other prioritygroups could be organised as part of the National Health Service.7. The Government has been criticised on this subject in thepress and an announcement of the action proposed below is being agreed with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.8.     I recommend that sufficient vaccine should be acquired bythe Health Departments to offer vaccination to essential health service staff as proposed in paragraph 5, but that no other action would seemto be required at the moment.J.K.V-M.Ministry of Health, S.W. 1.6th September, 1957.
