THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 16716th July, 1957CABINETOIL TRANSPORT FROM THE MIDDLE east memorandum by the Prime MinisterWhatever arrangements may be made for the future regime of the Suez Canal,the problems of oil transport from the Middle East will continue to be of special importance and urgency. These problems have been examined by a working party of officials, under the supervision of the Economic Secretary, and the following conclusions have been reached.&quot; External Aspects2. Discussions are going on between the United States and United kingdom governments and with the oil companies about the oil transport problem over thenext decade. We should press on with these as rapidly as possible so as to produce a joint Governmental appraisal of the amount of oil to be carried and the extentto which reliance is to be placed on the Canal and pipelines. With this, differences between the assessment of the oil companies and of Governments can be isolated and consideration given to means for bridging them.3. The oil companies should be urged to press on with their consideration ofthe specific additional pipelines schemes which they have discussed with governments. Consideration by the United States and United kingdom governments of the possibility of treaties to protect pipeline operations shouldcontinue as a matter of urgency.Internal Aspects4. Steel. The inadequacy of home supplies of steel plate is the pressingproblem here.  There is no quick solution.
5. Officials estimated that on the present plans of the steel companies, theshortage of home supplies should disappear in 1961-62. This is probably too optimistic: the completion date for some of these plans is already slipping. Easinessin home plate supplies seems unlikely to emerge before 1963-64. The present plans should be pressed forward as a matter of urgency and their progress kept under continuous review.6. The marginal shortage of home supplies of steel plate over the next five or six years will have to be met by imports. The increase in home steel prices should help to break down reluctance to import. No attempt should be made to offset the marginal shortage of home plate by cutting exports below the present low level or by formal systems of priorities or allocation, which would, throughhoarding, make the situation worse. Until the expansion of the industry has been effected the Iron and Steel Board should be encouraged to bring the needs of vitalindustries to the notice of the steel makers.7. Consideration is already being given to the need for further expansion plans for home production of steel plate and heavy sections to meet the growing demandup to 1965.Shipbuilding8. The existing plans of the industry provide for investment over the next five years at two or three times the rate previously obtaining and should result ina capacity of 2 million gross tons in 1961 an increase of nearly 50 per cent, overoutput in recent years. This is a welcome change of attitude by an industry which,until recently, has been hag-ridden by memories of old, unhappy far off things. a continuing watch should however be kept on the carrying out of these plans lestthey need fostering by Government action.9. The expansion plans of the industry provide substantially for the possibilityof building of large tankers. Dry-cargo vessels and liners are, however, as important for the United Kingdom economy as tankers and it may be more advantageous to build these. The balance of output as between tankers and other vessels should be left to the commercial judgment of the industry.10. No attempt should be made at this stage to force the growth ofthe United Kingdom industry beyond the 2 million tons capacity in paragraph 8.This would require the building of additional yards: and the uncertainty aboutdemand and about the competitiveness of the industry at a higher output seems atpresent too great. This position may, however, change for example as a result ofthe reappraisal in paragraph 2, and consideration should then be given as towhether any inducements to further expansion are required.Dry Docks11. Firm plans have been made for four large new docks to take largetankers: and others are projected. With these developments, this is not an urgentproblem.  A decision on whether any Government assistance to provide facilities
in addition to the above can be deferred until an expert appraisal of the positionup to 1965 by the Admiralty Dry Docks Committee is available. This Committeewill begin work on that problem shortly.Ports12. The oil companies are taking the steps to provide additional terminalfacilities for oil in the United Kingdom. The Government are taking action toestablish a Conservancy Authority at Milford Haven. No further government action is called for at present.Pipe13. Plans have been made to increase United Kingdom production of largepipe for oil trunk lines by 100,000 to 200,000 tons (i.e., an increase of 50 to 100 percent.) by 1961-62. This should enable the United Kingdom to take a reasonableshare, both in Middle East and other markets.Royal Dockyards14. The Royal Dockyards in the United Kingdom could make no significant contribution to tanker building. Further investigation is needed to ascertain whether any royal yards, which may become redundant, could usefully be adapted for commercial shipbuilding generally. The proposed concentration of navalrepair work in Royal Dockyards should free repair facilities in private yards. Asfar as yards abroad are concerned there are admittedly from time to time sparefacilities at Gibraltar, Malta, Singapore and Hong Kong and efforts are being madeto utilise these on a commercial basis. The question of more intensive and continuous use of these yards for commercial repair work is bound, up withreorganisation of naval work which is now being considered by the Admiralty.&quot;15. I have discussed these conclusions with the Economic Secretary and with sir Matthew Slattery, my special adviser on oil transport, who is in generalagreement with them. I have also considered how best the necessary impetus canbe maintained. For this purpose I have approved the appointment of an inter-departmental committee consisting of Sir Roger Makins (Chairman), Sir MatthewSlattery, and senior officials of the Treasury, Admiralty, Foreign Office. Ministryof Power and Ministry of Transport. This Committee will be responsible forexpediting the handling of all questions concerning the transport of oil from theMiddle East and for ensuring that the Ministers concerned are supplied with allthe relevant information. In this task they will have the assistance of the existinginterdepartmental Working Party. They will report to their own Ministers on anyparticular issue needing Departmental action but on major issues will report to me.H. M.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,15th July, 1957.
