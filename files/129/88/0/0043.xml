Printed for the Cabinet.  September1957SECRET Copy No.  60C. (57) 1934th September, 1957CABINETMONOPOLIES COMMISSION REPORT ON THE HEAVY ELECTRICALINDUSTRYMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn April 1952 certain products of the heavy electrical industry were referred tothe Monopolies Commission for examination. The Commission^ Report was presented to the Board of Trade in August 1956 and was published inFebruary 1957. The Report condemned agreements among the manufacturersrelated to their home trade and also agreements affecting exports. Homeagreements are a matter for the Restrictive Practices Court. I have asked the registrar to take a representative agreement before the Court at an early date.Export agreements are not within the Courfs jurisdiction, and it is for theGovernment to decide on the Commission^ recommendations.2.   The important Export Agreements condemned by the Commission are:  (a) Common Price Agreements (level tendering) between United kingdom manufacturers.(b) Compensation Agreements, between United Kingdom manufacturers,under which the successful tenderer pays certain fixed sums to theunsuccessful.(c) International Compensation Agreements on the same basis as (b) where therates are fixed with the aim of raising the level of world prices.Reasons for Accepting the Commission^ recommendations. (i) The Commission accepted that practices which might be objectionablein the home market might have different effects when applied to exports,but in spite of this, after lengthy and careful examination of thecircumstances of the industry, concluded, with one dissentient, that allthese export arrangements are against the public interest. They held that they protected inefficiency and led to rigidity. We should need tohave a strong case for over-riding the recommendations, of the statutorybody set up to advise on this subject.(ii) A decision to allow this industry to form such cartels would be attacked by the Opposition, who would almost certainly use it to suggest that theGovernment is not sincere in its proclaimed policy on cartels and restrictive practices, and that it was seeking to protect the restrictive practices of industry.(hi): The Commission^ inquiry was launched ^partly as a result of complaintsfrom overseas countries about level tendering and there is evidence thatCommon Price Agreements are generally disliked by overseascustomers, particularly in the Commonwealth. InternationalCompensation Agreements, which imply collaboration between UnitedKingdom and foreign manufacturers, would be particularly distastefulto Commonwealth buyers and a decision to reject the Commission^recommendations may lead to criticism by Commonwealth Govern-ments.52186
Reasons for Rejecting the Commission^ recommendations. If the industry is to keep its place in world markets and to carry out thenecessary expansion for the future it is essential that it should be able to secureenough capital for these purposes. At present competition is so fierce that someUnited Kingdom export contracts bring in no profit at all. The industryaccordingly ask to be allowed to enter into or extend arrangements with Europeancompetitors which would aim at securing a profit of some 15 per cent, in thirdmarkets. Their intention according to Lord Chandos is to abandon level tenderingand to substitute a range of prices. In support of their request the industry contend that:(i) their European competitors have their domestic markets reserved forthem; and the United Kingdom will never be allowed to tender in thesemarkets;(ii) European Governments allow their industries profits as high as 35 percent, on home orders provided they secure sufficient overseas orders,many at cut prices;(iii) European competitors already have negotiated prices between themselves;(iv) despite the Treaty of Rome the coming of the Common Market willtighten this system and will intensify the attack on third markets,including those in the Commonwealth;(v) no action the United Kingdom Government can take could prevent thisEuropean collaboration against our exporters;(vi) the volume of world business in heavy electrical plant is large enough tomake it reasonably certain that a gentleman&apos;s agreement between themain suppliers would be kept;(vii) the only alternative for United Kingdom manufacturers would be toincrease home prices in order to subsidise exports but this would laythe home market open to attack from foreign competitors.5. The arguments for accepting the Commission^ recommendations arestrong but I am convinced that the arguments against doing so are stronger. Wecannot afford to put the United Kingdom industry at a disadvantage with its competitors. We must be guided by our need to earn as much foreign exchangeas possible and I believe that the industry are right in their contention that if thepractices are condemned we shall lose more than we shall gain. If later theEuropean countries showed themselves ready to throw open their home marketswe could look at this question again.6. Suppose we accept the recommendation of the Monopolies Commission,a bitter price war will start between the British industry and their continentalcompetitors. Is that what we want when we know that unless Western Europe canunite and grow strong together the Communists will win everything? We wish tosee British and German interests, not enemies, but the closest of allies.7. If my colleagues agree, there are two possible lines of action. TheGovernment could announce now that it is rejecting the Monopolies Commission^recommendations, with a suitable statement of its reasons. Alternatively, as theindustry suggest, the Government could postpone making a public announcementuntil there was pressure to know what action was being taken on the Report. Inthis event it would be essential for me to warn the industry not to create a badatmosphere by any blatant arrangements to increase world prices, which I have no-reason to think they would do.8.   I would prefer to make a statement now.D. E.Board of Trade, Horse Guards Avenue,Whitehall, S.W.1,4th September, 1957.
