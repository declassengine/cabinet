PROPOSED I.B.R.D. LOAN TO THEUNITED KINGDOM NUCLEAR POWER programme memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at their meeting on 1st August, 1957 (C.C.(57) 60th Meeting,Minute 6) the Cabinet authorised me to explore without commitment thepossibilities of obtaining a loan from the International Bank for reconstruction and Development (I.B.R.D.) for the United Kingdomnuclear power programme without any market participation.   I took theopportunity of a recent visit to the United Kingdom by the President ofthe Bank, Mr. Black, to discuss this matter with him.   He said in effectit would be impossible for him to recommend to the Board of the Banka loan for the local currency expenditure under the nuclear power programme unless there was market participation in the loan.   He didnot attach any importance to fears about the danger to United Kingdomcredit of putting Government or nationalised industry bonds on theNew York market.   The operation would not be launched unless it was certain that it would be a success.   I think we must reconcile ourselves,therefore, to the fact that we shall not be able to exploit the I.B.R.D. asa potential source of long-term dollar borrowing unless we do agree to market participation.   On the other hand Mr. Black made it plain that he contemplated a continuing programme of dollar finance for expenditure from local currency.2.      I took the opportunity to enquire whether the Bank would be interested in assisting United Kingdom development in spheres other thanthat of nuclear energy e. g. conventional power stations, railways and soon.   To this Mr. Black replied that he would certainly not exclude this,but it must be realised that outside the nuclear power field it would bevery difficult for the Bank to make dollars available for local currencyexpenditure; and that in any case outside such a specialised field asnuclear power there would be the need to comply with the Bank*s normal requirements on international tender.3.      In view of these reactions I recommend that the Cabinet should nowauthorise me to explore the possibilities of a loan for the nuclear power programme with market participation.secret.,; 57) 1999*h September, 1957CABINETP.T.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.9th September, 1957
