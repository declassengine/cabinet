secret.(57) 181 COPY NO. (j^ &amp;27th July, 1957CABINETNATIONAL INSURANCE CHANGESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer would like to make some points on the paper by the Ministerof Pensions and National Insurance (C.(57) 180).2.        If we are to have a general increase in National Insurance,National Assistance and War Pensions by Christmas with nO public announcement until, say, October, and with the National Insurance bill and the National Assistance Resolutions pushed through in November assoon as possible after the Debate on the Adress, the best programme theMinister can devise leads to the following results -(a) Public leakage (including the precise new rate^ by earlySeptember, if not earlier,(b) public request fo beneficiaries to put in the books for up-rating before the Bill&apos;s presentation.(c) Up-rated order books in the hands of the public before thereis statutory authority for the new rates.(d) The risk of extra-statutory payments on an unprecedentedscale should anything go wrong.3.        The risk of a hitch - with extra-statutory payments inevitablyresulting - should not be overstressed, but we must take our decisions in full realisation of what would happen should it eventuate.   the accouting Officers, after drawing the position formally to the attentionof Ministers, would have received their instructions to proceed:  copieswould go to the Comptroller and Auditor General, who would report tothe Public Accounts Committee (P.A.C.).   The P.A.C. would be certain to animadvert on all this in due course, and the Opposition could beexpected to make the most of this &quot;financial irregularity&quot; or &quot;financialirresponsibility&quot; on the part of the Government.4.        Politically attractive though the operation is at first sight, i submit that, even if nothing &quot;goes wrong&quot;, the constitutional improprietieswhich it involves are very serious and would not redound to the Governmentscredit.   By printing the contribution stamps and uprating the order booksbefore there is statutory authority either for the new rates of contributionor for the new rates of benefit, we would make it impossible for parliament to do anything but rubber-stamp the Governments proposals in every particular.   Ordinarily, all the details are open to amendment in committee: none of them is protected by a Financial Resolution.   We
should expose ourselves to severe criticism by the Opposition whichmight be very difficult to answer.   Why had the Government not calledParliament back in time to deal with their proposals in the proper way ?Had they, with their usual inefficiency, made up their minds so late thatthey were driven to a panicky scramble as the only alternative to publicobloquy?   Or had they just not dared to submit their proposals to theproper Parliamentary processes, because they knew they could not justify so low a benefit or so high a contribution?5.        All this would create a thoroughly bad atmosphere for thediscussions on a Bill later in the session to implement a long-term plan,which is sure at best to be controversial in many respects.   It wouldalso have deplorable effects later on.   Not cr-iy would we ourselves find it a very inconvenient precedent.   It would be open to a future labour government to flout the established Parliamentary processes in the same way, or perhaps even worse, and to point to the present Government as their exemplar.6.        The future, immediate and long-term, of the National InsuranceScheme presents very difficult and very important problems.   our decisions must combine social generosity with financial and economic goodsense.   I believe we can reach such decisions.   The more I think of it,the more sure I am that we should, with the courage of our convictions,present our decisions as a coherent whole and be prepared to defendthem, and enact them, by the proper constitutional processes.   Lookingboth to the general context and to the immediate inflationary situation, i see no good reason for a scramble to get new rates through by Christmaseven if that could be done with constitutional propriety.7.        The proposed increase of lOs&quot;. in the National Insurance pension is very generous - the biggest increase made since the present schemewas introduced.   It is correspondingly expensive - not at once, butincreasingly so as the deficit emerges.   I think we can justify it if, butonly if, it is accompanied by three firm decisions - to abolish thetobacco concession, to have no further increase in this Parliament, and tobring in, by a later Bill in the 1957/58 session, a long-term plan whichwill put the finances of the Fund on a better basis.8.        The best course for the economy would be to announce all this in the late autumn, and to bring the intermediate operation into effect nextMarch or April, as we previously planned.    I recognise that a 2s. 6d.increase in National Assistance cannot be put off so long, and that theBoard might well wish to propose a further 2s. 6d. increase to coincide with the new National Insurance rates in the spring.   If my colleaguesfeel that this programme would be too tardy, then I think we are driven to the alternative of bringing the intermediate operation into effect inlate January - which could be done if the Bill is introduced and passedearly next session - although I recognise the administrative inconveniencewhich this date causes to the Minister of Fensions and National Insurance.P.T.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.27th July, 1957
