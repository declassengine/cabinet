(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST YTS GOVERNMENT)confidential.(57) 17419th July, 1957CABINETTHE CHANNEL, tunnel memorandum by the Minister of transport and Civil aviation on Znd May, the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for an urgent examination ofthe most advantageous method of conveying goods to and from theContinent in the circumstances of our participation in a mutual free trade area, taking into account the recent revival of interest in the constructionof a Channel Tunnel (C.C.(57) 37th Conclusions, Minute 3).2.    I have had this study made, and I have also consulted theFresident of the Board of Trade.   The study shows no clear prima faciecase for building a tunnel in order to help our trade with the Continent,and it suggests that goods might be moved almost as quickly, and with greater flexibility as to route at much less cost, by other methods suchas ferry ships.3.    There seems no case on these grounds for the Government totake an initiative in regard to a Channel Tunnel.   The matter is,however, being pressed by M. Georges-Picot through the Suez canal company.   He is proposing to set up a Syndicat d&apos;Etudes with a capital of  100,000, to be directed and financed as to 30 per cent each by theBritish and French Tunnel Companies, as to 30 per cent by the suez canal Company and as to 10 per cent by the American group who areinteresting themselves in the project.4.     It has been agreed that it would be unwise for one of the BritishGovernment Suez Canal Company Directors to serve on this Syndicatas this might appear to commit the Government to support the project.I propose, however, subject to my colleagues&apos; agreement, that weshould agree that one of the members of the British Transport Commissionwho is a director of the British Channel Tunnel Company should serve as a director of the Syndicat.   By this means we can keep ourselvesinformed of what is going forward without creating an appearance ofcommitting the Government, and the Commission^ participation willbe parallel to that proposed for the French Railways.COPY NO.
5.    I have been approached by the American Means Group, who wishto know the attitude of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to the Suez canal company&apos;s proposed study before making up their minds to participate.I propose, again subject to my colleagues agreement, to inform themthat Her Majesty&apos;s Government are keeping an open mind on the subjectwithout any commitment, but that we are raising no objection to the participation of the British Transport Commission through the BritishChannel Tunnel Company.H.W.Ministry of Transport and civil Aviation, W.l.19th July, 1957
