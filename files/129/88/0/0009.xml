(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL.C.(57)1595th July, 1957CABINETTHE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRYii i     -Memorandum by the Minister of Transport and civil aviation agree with the outline policy which the Minister of Supply puts forward in his paper C. (57) 154.    Indeed such a policy seems the only onefeasible in the circumstances that confront us.    I should, however, liketo bring to the notice of my colleagues the following observations.2,     I would wish to sound a note of caution on the extent to which therequirements of Transport Command and of civil operators can be matchedtogether to provide a domestic market which will support in all cases theproduction of aircraft on a private venture basis.    Transport Commandwill presumably always need specialised vehicles for operational purposes which will not generally be attractive to civil operators.    The balance ofTransport Commands requirements seems, on all present thinking, to be unlikely ever to produce a very large requirement for any particulartransport type.    The Airways Corporations, too, are not likely, at any ratein the foreseeable future, to have very large orders for particular typesbeyond what they have already placed, and the requirements of theindependent companies may be different from those of the Corporations.Thus, with the requirements split in this way, the total requirement,military and civil, for any particular type at any particular time will never be spectacularly large.    Nevertheless, it will help materially ifmilitary and civil requirements can be married as far as practicableprovided both elements plan equally far ahead and can keep in step with one another.3.     Both Corporations, however, have settled their major aircraft requirements for a good many years to come, apart from an outstandingBritish European Airways requirement for a small number of pure jet aircraft.    The independent companies are not likely to go in for new aircraft in any numbers whilst, under existing legislation, their presentopportunities remain so limited.    In any case there is not an unlimitedpool of air traffic into which they can dip to find employment for numbersof new aircraft.    Thus for the immediate future, there is little scope forany new worth-while home order for civil aircraft.4.      I attach considerable importance to the major projects mentionedin paragraph 12(iii) of C. (57) 154, namely, a supersonic transport with itsrelated engine and a helicopter of advanced design, such as would bringinter-city helicopter operations within the range of commercial practicability.I would expect to find in the same category, and receiving the same measureof Government support, the development and application to civil purposesCOPY NO.-1-
of the method of reducing the power needed to propel an aircraft, known asboundary-layer control, which is showing particular promise.    No doubtother projects will have to be considered later, such as direct lift and nuclear propulsion if we are to keep ahead in this field.5.     It is of the first importance that projects such as these should nptbe held up for lack of finance and, as the military contribution isdiminished, expenditure from the civil budget must take its place, though not necessarily to the same extent.6.     Whilst it is important to sell aircraft to our own operators whowill be demonstrating them in operation, we shall be dependent mainlyupon export sales to keep alive our civil aircraft industry, which hasalready shown What it can do by way of exports as a contribution to our national economy.    Some thought should, I suggest, be given to measures designed to improve our sales effort.    Strictly speaking this is a matter for the industry itself, but experience suggests that the present unco-ordinated sales efforts of individual firms may not be the best way of selling United Kingdom products in this field.    There might be some advantage in group selling and this might be studied by an advisorycommittee charged with the duty of collecting information about potentialoverseas markets, about the development of foreign aircraft and aboutother matters which have a bearing on our ability to export.    Such acommittee might be representative of the industry, the operators, other appropriate outside interests and of the Government Departmentsconcerned, e. g. Board of Trade, Transport and Civil Aviation, Supplyand possibly the Foreign Office and Colonial Office.    The one thing thatis certain is that it will be more difficult to sell British aircraft abroadagainst increasing foreign competition.    We should be sure that we useall the means available to us to counter this.H.W.Ministry of Transport and CivilAviation, W. 1.5th July, 1957.
