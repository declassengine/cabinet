M.Scottish Office, S.W.I.22nd July, 1957.copy NO.^1CABINETANNEXStatement on Future Administration of Scottish New TownsNone of the three New Towns in Scotland is yet approaching the stage when development will be substantially complete, nor will thishappen for another seven years at least.    The reasons given by my right on. Friend why New Town assets should not then pass to the localauthorities as envisaged by the New Towns Act are of course applicablein Scotland as well as in England and Wales, but it would be prematureat the present time to set about evolving an alternative system of manage-ment adapted to Scottish conditions.    Accordingly the Government proposethat the method to be adopted for managing the Scottish New Towns on completion should be left over for future consideration when the time isripe, by whatever means ma-&apos; then be appropriate, and that amendment ofthe New Towns Act in its application to Scotland should in consequencebe deferred.
