copy no.*3I have come to the opinion that we need an inquiry into the structure of local government in the Greater London area.   This question was discussed on 28th June by the Home Affairs Committee, who invited me to submit my proposal to the Cabinet (H.A.(57) 15th Meeting, Item 4).The existing local government system.        The Greater London area - meaning, roughly speaking, theMetropolitan Police District - has an odd and unrelated collection oflocal government systems.3.        At the heart of it there is the London County Council, with 28Metropolitan Boroughs and the City:  a highly centralised structure, with most of the worth-while responsibility concentrated in the County Council.Whatever one thinks of the London system of government, sooner or later the question of the Metropolitan Boroughs will have to be faced.   Theiralready limited functions are dwindling as their housing activities rundown for lack of land; and recently they have asked for a shift of powers from the County Council to themselves.   The County Council is prepared toagree to some shift.   But whereas some of the Metropolitan Boroughs arestrong, some are dangerously weak; and it is difficult to do much in thedirection of shifting powers, so long as the pattern of the Boroughs remainsuntouched.4.        In Middlesex there are 26 non-county boroughs and urban districts,including some of the largest in England.   This is a wholly urban county,but its pattern of government is, more or less, the ordinary two-tierpattern applicable to rural and semi-rural counties - except that rather more power is concentrated in the County Council than is the case in theordinary county.5.        The other metropolitan fringe areas, including some very largeboroughs, are governed on the ordinary two-tier system, except for thethree county boroughs of East Ham, West Ham and Croydon; but for countyadministration they look outward to Chelmsford, Maidstone, Kingston andHertford, not inward to London of which they are more naturally a part.(This document is the property of her britannic majesty^ government)secret.(57) 1522nd July, 1957cabinetlocal government reorganisation;greater london memorandum by the Minister of Housing andLocal Government and Minister for Welsh Affairsf,
6.        The White Paper on Areas and Status published in July 1956(Cmd. 9831) proposed that the provincial &quot;conurbations&quot; should be examined by the Local Government Commission, whose general functionis to be examination of the county/county borough pattern.    For the&quot;conurbations&quot; the Commission is to submit reports and draft orderscovering the whole pattern of local government, as appears to berequired by the circumstances of each area.    The same course wasnot proposed for Greater London, partly (l think) because the size ofthe job and the political issues which would be raised appeared to be too formidable;  and partly because there had been no discussions with representatives of the London County Council or the MetropolitanBoroughs, as there had been with representatives of all other localauthorities.    What was proposed for Greater London in the White Faperwas to exclude the County of London from review by the Commission:to keep Middlesex on a two-tier basis, with some redistribution of functions and rearrangement of districts:  and to leave the Commissionto tackle the fringe areas, with the probability that the result would berearrangement of these, or of some part of them, into a series ofcounty boroughs.7.        There were obvious difficulties from the first about this approach.     If the Government thought it desirable to review the otherconurbation areas, so much the more (it might well be said) oughtGreater London to be brought under review.    Of greater practical importance, however, was the prospect that adoption of the piece-mealpolicy might involve the creation of a series of county boroughs round the two urban counties.    We should then have two county systems inthe middle of the area (one with most of the weight at the top and theother with most of the weight at the bottom) and a county boroughsystem round the fringe.    Yet all of this great urban area has similar problems of local government, and indeed in some sense the whole isone vast town.    The obvious question is whether the two-tier system,if appropriate to any of the area, is not appropriate to all of it, and whatkind of two-tier system it should be.    It is worth examining whether thereis a genuine case for an overall authority discharging some functionsover the Greater London area as a whole; the broad planning of thearea is an obvious example, and perhaps traffic (which I know theMinister of Transport is already considering) is another.    There maybe certain technical services (for example, refuse disposal) which shouldbe planned and operated on behalf of the whole area, as water supplyand distribution already are.    This is a big question which in my viewought to be resolved before any additional county boroughs are createdwithin the area, since it would be embarrassing and indeed virtually impossible first to create new county boroughs and then to take awaysome of the powers newly bestowed.8.        It was with these considerations in mind that the White Fapersaid (paragraph 47) that the Commission, while looking at the fringeareas, should be entitled to make recommendations about any matters which might well be handled jointly on behalf of Greater London as awhole.    On reflection, I do not think this a workable proposal.    TheCommission could not be asked to undertake, as an incidental part oftheir job, what would amount to an examination of the working ofgovernment throughout Greater London.9. A further difficulty about the White Paper approach was that itdepended to a large extent on reaching a settlement in Middlesex. Thelocal authority Associations agreed, as part of a national negotiation,
that in Middlesex there should be no county boroughs, but that the boroughs and districts, after reorganisation, should be given greaterpowers.    They were driven to this  conclusion because in Middlesexit seems that there are, within the existing structure of local government,only two practicable courses: all county boroughs or no county boroughs.Since then, it has become clear that even if the great Middlesex boroughsare prepared to give up their undoubted claims to become county boroughs - which some, at any rate, of them are most unwilling to do -all the larger ones will claim certain of the more important powers in their own right;   and since these larger boroughs cover the greaterpart of the county, the result would be a radical reduction in the CountyCouncils responsibilities.    The claims of the boroughs would bedifficult to resist;  but the effect on the County Council would be disastrous.    The question then would be whether a two-tier system could survive in Middlesex unless it is to survive as part of are organisation of the whole of the Greater London area.   The problemsof Middlesex cannot be settled in isolation.The case for an inquiry10.      It is this emerging difficulty about a settlement inMiddlesex, combined with the disadvantages inherent in the White Paperapproach, which has led me to re-examine our policy and to considerwhether the best course would not be to grasp the nettle now, and to setup an inquiry into the structure of local government appropriate tothe Greater London area.11.      There is a great deal to be said for this.    We would avoid the admittedly unsatisfactory piecemeal approach in the White Paper.The case for planning or operating certain functions on a uniform basisthroughout the whole area would be thoroughly gone into;  at the momentwe simply do not have an up-to-date statement of the facts on which todetermine whether there is a need for anything of this kind.    Above all,as things stand, it is very difficult to sustain the proposition that this great area, with its different types of government yet with commonproblems, does not need to be looked at as a whole (as the provincial&quot;conurbations&quot; are to be looked at) before any steps are taken to reorganise any particular part of it.12.      The arguments on the other side are evident.    A decision tohave an inquiry can be represented as a device for deferring action;and there will be an adverse reaction from one or two of the great fringeboroughs (particularly Ilford) which have for years past been hopingto become county boroughs and have been put off because of the promise ofgeneral reorganisation.     They will resent further delay, and will quitepossibly try to fend for themselves by promoting Bills.    Further, it means grasping the London County Council/Metropolitan Borough nettle,with all its political complications;  my expectation is that the LondonCounty Council (though not the Conservative members thereof) would be strongly opposed to an inquiry, from which it could not hope to gain andwhich might indeed threaten its existence.    Finally, there is always the possibility that an inquiry might produce proposals unacceptable to the Government of the day.13.      Despite all this, it seems to me that the best course,administratively and politically, is to have an inquiry.    The decisiveargument in my view is that we would not be justified in re-organising the metropolitan fringe areas in isolation, and in patching up a settlement in Middlesex, without first having subjected the problems and needs of the
whole area to proper study.    There can be no dispute that all these areas together have common problems, and that these ought to beanalysed and a decision reached on the general structure appropriate to the whole area before we start to re-organise parts of it.    That isa case which we can present publicly with conviction, and which itis extremely hard for anyone to oppose.14.      The essence of the matter is that we must do something; the pressing claims of the great boroughs in Middlesex and elsewhere leave us no choice.    The White Paper approach does not meet the needs ofthe situation as we can now see them.    The task is much too big tobe done by the Local Government Commission as a by-product of examining the metropolitan fringe;  and it is a task requiring the mainattention of those commissioned to undertake it.    There is plainly a need on a matter of this importance for the facts to be examined, andfor the right kind of structure to be considered in general terms,as a preliminary to the actual review of boundaries and allocation of functions.    If the proposals which emerge are unacceptable, we mustbe prepared to say so when the time comes.    We shall at the leasthave secured the material on which informed decisions can be taken.Scope of the Inquiry15.      If it is decided to have an inquiry, I think that the terms ofreference should be wide.    I would propose something on the followingline st&quot;To examine the present system of localgovernment in Greater London, and to make recommend-ations about the general structure appropriate to thewhole area and about the distribution of the main localgovernment functions, including the need, if any, for an overall authority or authorities to plan or executeparticular functions throughout the area or substantialparts of it&quot;.16.      We should have to consider carefully the area to be reviewed.Broadly, it should be the area within the green belt, which is most conveniently described as the Metropolitan Police District;  but thoseconducting the inquiry should, I think, be free either to stop short of that area, or to go a bit beyond it if they saw strong cause for doing so.Police administration, not being in the London area a local governmentfunction, would not be in question.17.      The last inquiry into London government was abortive - a departmental Committee set up in 1945 under Lord Reading to examine and review areas and functions in the County of London.    The Committeewas dissolved eighteen months later by Mr. Bevan, on the grounds thatthe problem before the Committee could not satisfactorily be divorced from that of Greater London, and that the local authorities most closelyaffected had taken the view that, in advance of an inquiry into the widerproblem, they could submit little more than factual evidence to theCommittee.    So there has been no completed inquiry since 1923, when a Royal Commission under Lord Ullswater presented a majority and twominority reports on &quot;the local government of the County of London andthe surrounding districts&quot;.    The majority report (signed by the chairman and three members) in effect found on the evidence before them nothingfundamentally wrong with the existing system;  but both the minority
reports (each signed by two members) found a case for an overallauthority to deal with certain matters.18.      I think that the inquiry should take the form of a RoyalCommission.   I was originally doubtful about this, mainly for the reason that the procedure adopted may have to be somewhat different from thatusually employed by Royal Commissions.   (One of the Ullswaterminority groups said that the procedure adopted by that Commission had made it impossible to arrive at a proper conclusion.)  The point here isthat the body conducting this inquiry will have to be extremely pertinaciousin order to arrive at the facts - the individual local authorities will not look beyond their own boundaries.   The inquirers will probably need todo much of their work in camera.   My first thought was that it might bedesirable to underline the difference between the kind of inquiry Ienvisage and the kind usually associated with Royal Commissions byproposing a new device - a special Commission of Inquiry.   On reflection,however, I believe there is great advantage in the power and prestige of a royal Commission.   Such a Commission can adopt whatever procedure itlikes, and I would propose to make it clear to whomever we select forChairman what sort of procedure I think will be needed.19.      My idea is a small Commission, consisting of perhaps four or five people able to understand the problems of government involved and toexamine them impartially.   For Chairman I would hope to find someone-with experience of public administration.20.      The inquiry will take from two to three years.   I could ensure,I think, that the Report was not completed before the Election, if theCabinet agrees with the Home Affairs Committee that that would be wise.21.      Pending the report, no changes should be made in the areas orstatus of local authorities within the area covered by the inquiry.   i could ensure that the Local Government Commission to be established under the forthcoming legislation left the Greater London area alone.A more difficult question is whether any changes should be allowed mean-while in the distribution of functions between county and county district councils within the area. It would obviously be desirable to postponemajor changes, if that can be done without antagonising the localauthorities.   I would propose to discuss this with those of my colleagues who are concerned, before the Bill is drafted.The next steps22.      If the Cabinet approve this proposal for an inquiry, I would seethe leaders of the London County Council, the Metropolitan Boroughs andthe Middlesex authorities and tell them informally and confidentially whatthe Government has in mind.   A public announcement would have to bemade during the debate on local government reorganisation planned towardsthe end of July, since I shall be required to make clear in that debate theGovernments attitude towards local government re-organisation in bothLondon and Middlesex.   If, following the inquiry, the Government decidedthat alterations should be made in the local government structure of theGreater London area, a further Bill would be necessary; but not, of course,in this Parliament.
To sum up23.      I propose that a general inquiry into the structure of localgovernment appropriate to the Greater London area should be undertaken;that it should take the form of a Royal Commission; and that this shouldbe announced during the forthcoming debate at the end of July.H.B.Ministry of Housing andLocal Government, S.W.1.2nd July, 1957
