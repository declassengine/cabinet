SECRETMEETING OF COMMONWEALTH FINANCE MINISTERS: CANADIANPROPOSAL FOR A COMMONWEALTH ECONOMIC conference the Canadian Government have circulated a memorandum for discussion at the meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers which is to be held inSeptember at Mont Tremblant. In this memorandum the Canadian authoritiesreturn to their proposal for a Commonwealth Economic Conference.2. The memorandum proposes for discussion a wide range of miscellaneoustopics. It seems unlikely, in the light of past experience, that a commonwealth economic Conference with so heterogeneous an agenda would yield useful results.3. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom Government should not adopt a negative attitude to the proposal, particularly as there is no certainty that theAnglo-Canadian trade talks will show positive results. The new CanadianAdministration are well-disposed towards the United Kingdom; and, if their initiative appeared to be rebuffed by the United Kingdom and the rest of theCommonwealth, they might encounter serious domestic political difficulties. Asa result we might lose for a long time, perhaps for ever, the present opportunityto arrest the tendency that has developed since the war for Canada to move closer,in the economic field, towards the United States and away from the UnitedKingdom. Misunderstanding of our attitude would be likely to arise both in thiscountry and in Canada, particularly as we are at the moment taking a leading partin the negotiations for closer economic association with Europe.4. There would in any case be advantage in the context of the negotiationsfor the European Free Trade Area if the United Kingdom Government were knownto have under consideration arrangements which might appear to provide some alternative course. Indeed, if the European Free Trade Area negotiations are completed next spring (or even if they fail), a Commonwealth Economic conference might be desirable shortly afterwards to examine the implications of the newEuropean trade arrangements (or our failure to achieve them). Problems are also likely to arise from the drawing down of their sterling balances by commonwealth countries in process of development: these too might be appropriate for discussion at a Conference.5. At the meeting of Finance Ministers, therefore, we should adopt a positiveattitude. If the general feeling of the meeting is favourable to the idea of aConference, the United Kingdom should take the lead in endorsing it, subject to adequate preliminary preparations by a meeting of senior Commonwealth officialsearly in 1958. If, on the other hand, other Commonwealth Finance Ministersshow that they are not attracted by it, we should seek to rescue the canadian authorities from embarrassment by suggesting (a) that a special meeting of senior Commonwealth officials should be heldearly in 1958 to discuss (i) the developments in the Europeannegotiations, and (ii) the whole range of Commonwealth economic problems. This meeting could advise Commonwealth Governmentswhether there appeared to be need for a Commonwealth EconomicConference or for some other gathering of Ministers; and(b) that in fact it may well prove desirable to have a meeting of commonwealth ministers in 1958 to consider the implications for the Commonwealthof whatever may result from the European Free Trade Areanegotiations.6. In advance of the meeting of Finance Ministers no indication should begiven either to the Canadian authorities, or to other Commonwealth governments that we have any reservations about the proposed Conference.7. Whether or not the idea of a Commonwealth Economic Conference findsfavour at Mont Tremblant, we might tell Commonwealth Finance Ministers thatthe Commonwealth Secretary would propose, if they agree, to arrange as necessaryfor regular ad hoc meetings with Commonwealth High Commissioners (orappropriate representatives) in London to keep the European Free Trade Areanegotiations under continuous and close review with them and to supplement theregular flow of information and exchange of ideas through the CommonwealthLiaison Committee and other existing channels.52219a
