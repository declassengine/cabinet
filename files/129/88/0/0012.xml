C      (H Vi&apos;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1957SECRET Copy No.   54C. (57) 16212th July, 1957CABINETCOLONIAL IMMIGRANTSReport of the Committee of MinistersWhen the Cabinet considered the question of coloured immigration in July,1956 (CM. (56) 48th Conclusions, Minute 10) the total coloured population inthis country was about 100,000, approximately half being West Indians. Beforethe war the number of coloured people here was only about 7,000. During the years1953, 1954 and 1955 the numbers of new arrivals were about 3,000, 10,000 and35,000 respectively. Last July the Cabinet thought that the balance of advantage lay against introducing legislation immediately to enable the flow of immigrationto be controlled. In the autumn the Cabinet reviewed the position (CM. (56)85th Conclusions, Minute 8) and decided that the question should be kept underconsideration. They therefore invited the Committee of Ministers under my chairmanship to present a further report in the spring of this year.2. We now submit at Annex &quot; A &quot; a progress report completed up to the endof May. This shows that the highest rate of immigration so far was reached inJune last year. The numbers of arrivals then began to decline, and from Augustonwards dropped steeply until February, since when they have risen slightly.There is always a seasonal decline in the winter months, but the reduction in the arrival rate since last summer was so large that it was probably attributable to other factors as well. Potential immigrants may have been discouraged both by theofficial warnings put out about conditions in this country and by letters sent homeby migrants already here. The Suez campaign and fears of war may also have played a part. During the first five months of 1957 the total net immigration of west Indians was 5,500, compared with 12,700 in the corresponding period of1956 and 9,000 in the corresponding period of 1955.3. There has been a steady influx of Indians and Pakistanis, amounting in total to some 9,000 in 1956, though many of these are students who will ultimatelyreturn home. However, many others are illiterate and of low social standing. Anumber of them have been joined here by their wives and children; hitherto theyhave not, in general, settled here permanently. Reliable statistics of the totalIndian and Pakistani population in this country are not available, but it is thought to be of the order of 45,000, including students.4. Taking an optimistic view of the situation, the rate of coloured immigrationhas fallen considerably compared with last year and although the number of newarrivals has lately tended to rise slightly there is at present no cause for alarm.For the most part the coloured immigrants are law-abiding, tend to keep to themselves, and form a useful addition to the country&apos;s labour force, particularly as most of them are young people.5. On a more pessimistic assessment, a continuing increase in the colouredpopulation of some 2,000 a month, including more than 1,000 West Indians, is stillsubstantial enough to give rise to problems and to justify misgivings. The presentreasonably amicable relations between the white and the coloured populationmight not long survive the onset of an industrial recession leading to competition for employment. But perhaps the most disturbing element in the situation is the transformation, in some areas, of whole streets into completely &quot; black &quot; streets.In Brixton, north-west London and Birmingham, for example, property is being51890
House of Lords, S.W. 1.10th July, 1957.bought by coloured landlords, who then make intolerable the position of whitetenants and force them to move out. Not surprisingly there is already evidence ofresentment over these developments. Difficulties of this kind are bound to increase as the numbers of coloured immigrants living here continue to rise.6. We have come to the conclusion that while there is much to support theview that it would be desirable for the Government to have in reserve executive powers to restrict the influx of coloured immigrants, public opinion is not yet ready for legislation of this kind and its introduction at present would not be justified,particularly having regard to current constitutional developments in the colonies;but the situation should remain under review. It may well be that if the influxcontinues action will become inevitable. Social problems are already arising andmay at any time become the subject of acute public concern. The Governmentshould therefore be ready to introduce restrictions on colonial immigration at short notice.7. We have considered by what means such restrictions might be imposed.In the report which we submitted to the Cabinet in June, 1956 (CP. (56) 145) itwas proposed that the Inter-Departmental Working Party should examine thepolicy and administrative aspects of a quota system. We now submit, at Annex&quot; B,&quot; the Working Party&apos;s report. In our view the objections to a quota systemadvanced by the Working Party are conclusive, and we are satisfied that if controlof colonial immigration is to be introduced reliance should be placed on the methodprovided for in the draft Bill submitted to the Cabinet in September, 1955(CP. (55) 166). This Bill would enable provision to be made by Order in council for prohibiting the entry into the United Kingdom of British subjects coming fromthe Commonwealth for other than temporary visits, unless suitable housing accommodation were available for them, and they either came for authorisedemployment or were able to support themselves. The Working Party suggest thatthe restrictions could be operated in such a way as to reduce coloured immigrationvery considerably, without appearing to be designed for this purpose, or to bedeliberately so operated;K.(on behalf of the Committee).
8363 f-   ----ANNEX ACommittee on Colonial ImmigrantsProgress ReportOn 20th November the Cabinet invited us to keep under review the trend of coloured immigration and of employment among coloured people and to submit a further report in the spring (CM. (56) 85th Conclusions).Rate of immigration .2. It is estimated that during 1956 the coloured community in this countryincreased by more than 40,000 persons. Exact figures cannot be given &apos;beeausethere are no official statistics of the various categories of British subjects enteringand leaving the country and there is a constant movement of coloured persons in both directions. A fair idea can be obtained of the numbers of West Indiansbecause West Indians known to be seeking work usually arrive in large parties andthe Governors of the West Indian territories usually send advance notice of their arrival. Immigrants from other Commonwealth countries do not normally travel in organised parties and there is consequently no reliable way of assessing their numbers. Since October, 1954, immigration officers have been keeping records,so far as it is practicable, of coloured British subjects entering and leaving UnitedKingdom ports; these include not only persons coming here to settle but alsopersons whose stay, although temporary, may be prolonged, e.g., students, but thebalance of this traffic over a period is thought to be a reasonably accurate indication of the trend of migration. In addition to the ordinary passenger traffic there arealso a number of persons who come here either as seamen and desert their ships or as stowaways.3. Of the 40,000 or more persons who were added to the coloured population in 1956, some 29,000 were West Indians. The remainder, who represent thebalance of the inward passenger traffic of coloured persons, included some 7,600Indians and Pakistanis, about 2,000 West Africans and about 1,000 Arabs fromAden. The number of Indian and Pakistani seamen deserters reported during1956 totalled some 1,200 and coloured stowaways accounted for another 81immigrants.4. In 1953 it was estimated that the total number of coloured British subjects in the country was something over 40,000 (about one-fifth of whom were students)and that immigration was increasing at the rate of about 3,000 a year. The increasein 1954 however was something like 10,000 and in 1955 it was about 35,000. Ifthe estimated increase of 40,000 in 1956 is added to these figures the present total british coloured population would appear to be somewhere in the region of 120,000.5. The number of West Indian immigrants in 1956 was 3,000 higher thanthe number in 1955 and 19,000 higher than the number in 1954. It would thereforeseem that the flow had steadied. It is not possible to forecast the future trend ofthis traffic but the graph below shows the steady decline from last June to Februaryin the number of arrivals each month. Since February there has been a slight rise.The decline since last summer cannot have been wholly seasonal. The total numberof immigrants who have arrived each month since last September has been considerably lower than in corresponding months in 1955 and 1956. The reasonsfor this can only be surmised but it may be that prospective emigrants are heedingthe warnings about conditions in this country which the British Caribbean WelfareService in the United Kingdom and the West Indian Governments are understood to be releasing to West Indian newspapers.

There appears to have been no falling off in the rate of immigration from india and Pakistan. Accurate figures of the number of Indians and Pakistanisnow residing in this country are not available, but an estimate of something like40,000 has been made for the end of 1956, and perhaps about 45,000 by the endof May, 1957. These figures are very approximate, and include a large numberof students, most of whom will return to India and Pakistan. The Governmentsof India and Pakistan are doing what they can to control the exodus of their nationals but their action is limited statutorily, and they are also restricted by political considerations.Distribution of the coloured population7. &apos; In 1953, when the subject of coloured immigration was first consideredby the present Administration, the Departmental Working Party on coloured people seeking employment in the United Kingdom made a confidential approachfor information to the Chief constables in whose areas large numbers of coloured people were known to be living. A summary of the information so obtained ,wasembodied in paragraphs 19-24 of the Working Party&apos;s Report. The chief constables concerned were recently asked to report on developments in their districts since 1953; and the chief constables of districts in which sizeable colouredcommunities were believed to have grown since 1953 were also consulted. Asummary of the information submitted by the police is comprised in paragraphs-13 below.  &apos;8. The coloured population is now fairly widely distributed over the country,the largest communities being in London, the Midlands and the North-West.Since 1953 the coloured population of London has doubled and in some provincialdistricts the rate of increase has been greater still. The expansion in some districtsis partly due to the arrival of persons from places where work is more difficult toobtain. A feature now becoming noticeable is the expansion in the Indian andPakistani communities: They are to be found wherever there are other coloured
communities but in some places they far outnumber other races. The general opinion about them is that the majority are illiterate, of very low social standing and suitable only for menial work. They have not the same degree of educationas the West Indians and are further handicapped by language difficulties. , Anumber have been joined in this country by their wives and children a feature of permanency not hitherto apparent amongst these people.Relations with white people, conduct and living conditions9. The police reports state that the degree of assimilation is no greater thanin 1953. The immigrants show no desire in general to mix with white people or with immigrants of other races and it is thought that the arrival of increasing numbers fosters their tendency to associate only with each other. (But as regardsassociation of coloured men with white women, see paragraph 13 below.) Theattitude of the white people ranges between tolerance or indifference andresentment, though relations between white and coloured workers are amicable.The lack of any social intermingling seems to be due as much to the desire of thecoloured people themselves as to any attitude of their white neighbours,10. In general the immigrants conduct themselves well and it cannot besaid that their presence has caused any problems of public order. Such incidentsas occur are usually the result of quarrels amongst themselves, but in Londonthey have had clashes with &quot; Teddy Boys.&quot; The police point out that theseincidents have usually occurred in districts which have long been the scene ofdisturbances and disputes and there is no reason to suppose that the situation has been aggravated by the presence of coloured people. It has been pointedout both by the Metropolitan Police and by some provincial police forces that although at present there are no signs of tension the tolerant attitude of the whitepeople will last only so long as the coloured people do not encroach on the interestsof the rest of the community. The situation might be very different should there be widespread unemployment resulting in competition for jobs between whiteand coloured workers.   So far, however, there seems no cause for alarm.11. There is no reason to suppose that the influx of immigrants since 1953has resulted in an increase of crime, but a minority continue to diplay a tendency to engage in brothel keeping and living on immoral earnings of women (althoughthe numbers are in themselves quite small); and there is evidence that coloured people continue to account (in respect of Indian hemp) for a disproportionatenumber of convictions under the Dangerous Drugs Acts. It is noted however that this propensity towards certain types of offence is mainly confined to London,Liverpool and Manchester; elsewhere, there is little evidence of activities of thiskind. Certain police forces have referred to sexual offences committed by colouredmen, e.g., Indians and Pakistanis in north-eastern seaports and West Africans inLondon.12. At best, living conditions can only be described as poor. Manyimmigrants are living in large and often outworn houses owned by coloured andforeign landlords who let them at high rents and permit gross overcrowding.This causes some resentment amongst white residents. The attitude of somecoloured landlords in London towards white tenants is described as vicious. It issaid that they will go to any lengths to evict white persons. The majority of homesare dirty and poorly furnished and although many immigrants have been earninggood money they show no desire to improve their conditions.Miscegenation and Illegitimacy13. Although at present miscegenation does not appear to be widespread theinformation supplied by the police suggests that it is increasing. In most districts where there is a coloured community of a few years&apos; standing, many coloured menare married to or living with white women of low social standing or low morals.The number of half-caste children in these districts is increasing and many arethought to be illegitimate. An increase in West Indian illegitimacy has also beennoted but no doubt this is partly due to the unorthodox West Indian attitude tomarriage. It would not seem possible to forecast the future, but miscegenationmay well be curbed by the comparatively recent practice among Indians and
7  83-E.ANNEXBSecond Report of the Working Party to Report on the Social and economic problems Arising from the Growing Influx into the United Kingdom of coloured Workers from other Commonwealth countries the Quota system on 11th July, 1956, the Cabinet took note of a report from the Committee on colonial Immigration which asked us to examine both the policy and theadministrative aspects of a suggestion that any legislation on British immigrationshould include a reserve power to impose a quota on Commonwealth subjectspermitted to enter this country (CM. (56) 48th Conclusions, Minute 10).2. At the outset it may be useful to remind the Committee of the nature ofthe scheme of control provided for in the draft Bill. The Bill would make it possibleto prohibit the entry into the United Kingdom of any British subject not belongingto the United Kingdom or any citizen of the Irish Republic not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom or the Republic; provided that entry could not be refusedto anyone within the scope of the control if he satisfied the authorities that hewas coming only for a temporary visit or to take up authorised employment, or that he was in a position to support himself and his dependants in the UnitedKingdom without taking employment, though even persons belonging to theseexempted categories could still be refused entry on medical grounds or grounds ofPakistanis of sending for their wives, and by the fact that about 40 per cent, ofthe West Indian immigrants now coming in are women.Employment14. Since September, 1956, employers have tended to get rid of their marginalworkers, namely married women, part-time workers and other unskilled and semi-skilled workers. There has been increasing difficulty in placing unemployed workers in employment, because there are fewer vacancies and there is a scarcity of semi-skilled and unskilled jobs which generally speaking are the only ones forwhich coloured people are suitable. During the six months ended in mid-March,1957, the national figure of the wholly unemployed went up by 110,000 from225,200 to 335,400, an increase of 49 per cent. However, the increase in umemployment amongst coloured workers during the same period, in spite of newarrivals since September, 1956, was only 413 (from 6,772 to 7,185) an increase of only 6 -1 per cent. West Indians in particular seem to find jobs fairly readily andit cannot be said that unemployment amongst coloured people in this country isa serious problem.Health15. It remains true that so far as the National Health Service is concernedthere is insufficient evidence to suggest that coloured immigrants constitute aspecial problem. Comprehensive statistics of the incidence of communicablediseases among the immigrants do not exist and reliance has therefore had to beplaced on such information as has become available from local sources. On thisfooting, there are indications that the immigrants have added to the work of thevenereal disease clinics; on the other hand, at least among the West Indians, thetuberculosis rate does not provide any ground for anxiety.Attitude of Local Authorities16. During recent months the attitude of local authorities who in the early days of immigration were inclined to draw attention to housing problems hasundergone some modification although the problems remain as difficult as ever.They now appear to be more disposed to deal with the particular problems causedby immigrants Irish and European as well as coloured as part of the generalhousing problem caused by overcrowded conditions in heavily over-populated areas.
national security and public order. Provision is also made for entry to be refusedto any person, other than a temporary visitor, who fails to satisfy the immigrationauthorities that satisfactory housing accommodation is available for himself andhis dependants. The Ministerial Committee suggested that in addition to these powers a reserve power to impose a quota would make it possible for the centralGovernment to assume complete control of the situation if need arose.Advantages of a Quota System(a) Economic -3. If the object of control is economic, it will presumably be achieved ifimmigration can be restricted to an extent which is likely to obviate any serious problem of redundant labour arising from it. If it were possible to decide without difficulty on the extent to which such restriction should be applied over a givenperiod, then a quota might well be more effective in achieving this than the methodof control provided for in the draft Bill, which cannot easily be related to anynumerical target, and it might have some advantages from the point of view of presentation. For instance, if one could announce at the beginning of each yearwhat would be the quota for the year this would be an easier system to explainthan somewhat arbitrary &quot; cuts &quot; in the number of labour permits and housingcertificates issued.(b) Social and Political4. If the object is social and political, this implies that it might be desired toimpose on the increase of the coloured population restrictions greater than wouldbe justified on purely economic grounds. The system of control provided for in thedraft Bill relies mainly on the deterrent effect on employers (and indirectly on the oversea territory of origin) of the administrative obstacles to be surmounted. in theory, a fixed quota might make it easier to keep the numbers down.Disadvantages(1) Fixing of Quotas   .(a) An Overall Quota5.  The quota system in its simplest form would be an overall restriction onthe total number of British subjects permitted to settle in this country from overseas. There is the greatest difficulty in deciding on what basis this could be calculated.  To begin with, no one knows whether in principle the population ofthis country ought to be increased or reduced; the Royal Commission onPopulation, which reported in 1949 after five years of consideration, found itselfunable to advise on the point. If it be assumed that the country&apos;s economic positionno longer permits of unrestricted immigration, it would no doubt be logical to fix the global figure as a definite percentage of the total immigration from commonwealth countries, Colonial territories and British protected States, &amp;c,during some recent year. It would, however, be important to select what could be properly regarded as a &quot; normal year &quot; and not, for example, such years as 1953,1954 or 1955 in which migration from certain countries, e.g., the British West Indies,India and Pakistan was already &quot; abnormal.&quot; A fundamental difficulty is, however,encountered in selecting any year for this purpose, as reliable and comprehensivestatistics of immigration, other than of aliens, are lacking. It would seem unwise to make do with approximate estimates and guesses on the basis of the available information, e.g., the Board of Trade&apos;s figures of migrants using the long sea routes,issue of new insurance cards to Commonwealth citizens by the Ministry of Pensionsand National Insurance, &amp;c. A most distorted picture might arise from using suchincomplete and, in some ways, misleading sources. It would be difficult to defend a  global quota, having regard to the detailed scrutiny and searching criticism whichit is bound to attract, unless it is based on reasonably firm and accurate statistical information.(b) Quotas by Territories .6. In practice a quota cannot reasonably be operated by turning people back from British ports: it is necessary to have some system that prevents them from leaving their own territory. This means that the overall quota must be broken down by territories; the person intending to settle here must apply locally for
\ 83 esomething corresponding to a visa; and the issuing authority in the oversea territorymust therefore be aware how many such permits it is in a position to issue. on what basis are the quotas to be apportioned between the various territories? Ifthe quotas are to be in proportion to the populations of the various territories, thenIndia will receive a quota 170 times that of New Zealand, and 4,400 times that of aden. Nigeria, with 31 million inhabitants, will be allowed twenty times as many as Jamaica. A quota system operated on such a basis would be purposeless, quite apart from the serious political effects that it would produce in the Caribbean and elsewhere. A different method of calculation would be to relate each territory^quota to past experience of immigration from that country, selecting a point intime before the Caribbean influx. Tables showing the birthplace of personsenumerated in Great Britain at the 1951 Census might be regarded as a broad basis for determining these ratios. The collated returns clearly disclose the pattern ofthat part of the population at the Census date born in Commonwealth countries,Colonial territories, &amp;c, and the figures can be &quot; broken down &quot; in respect of allthe larger countries concerned, e.g., Nigeria, Gold Coast, Kenya, Jamaica,Trinidad, &amp;c. Unfortunately, however, there is no means of ascertaining how far the figure of 137,000 in respect of Ceylon, India and Pakistan relates to persons ofUnited Kingdom ancestry, and the same difficulty, though to a lesser extent, would apply to other Commonwealth countries and Colonies. There are groundstherefore for some uneasiness in making the 1951 Census &quot;returns the basis for afair allocation of country quotas. Apart from the Census no other statistical information appears to be available. It stands out clearly enough that it is notpossible to produce from a quota system a result having any relation to the objectof the exercise unless the quotas are so fixed as openly to discriminate againstcoloured people. This would make it difficult if not impossible to secure any political or social advantage from a quota system (see paragraph 8 below).(2) Policy Objections7. If legislative provision is made for a quota system, the Government will inevitably be asked to indicate the kind of situation in which it would be used.Moreover, if a power to impose quotas reaches the statute book there will be onthe one hand continual pressure from certain quarters on the Government to use the power against coloured immigrants, and, on the other hand, continual fearsin the West Indies and other Commonwealth territories that the power will be soused.8. The essentially discriminatory character of quotas could not be hidden.The quotas would have to be published, and in their anxiety to avoid fixing andannouncing a quota which would be so small as to arouse controversy,Governments might be driven to fix it so high that it would have no practical effect.The Bill as it stands at present has the very great merit of not appearing to bediscriminatory.9. The imposition of quotas might provoke retaliation by countries, such as india and Pakistan, which at present impose little or no restriction on the entry of United Kingdom citizens. j10.   If quotas were imposed on all Commonwealth territories there would be ja demand for a quota against the Irish Republic.  Fixing the amount of such a quota would be a matter of the utmost difficulty, as also would the definition of Ithe persons who should come under it. The practical difficulties of operating animmigration control against the Irish have already been set out in Note C.I. (56) 5sent to the Ministerial Committee by the Home Secretary.11. The imposition of a quota system on British subjects would lead to ademand for it to be imposed on aliens also. The answer to such a demand is thata quota system is inappropriate to our administration of the Aliens Order, sinceapart from individuals admitted under some specific head of policy there is no room for general (i.e., bloc) admission of aliens of particular nationalities. The existingadministration of the Aliens Order is in fact more stringent than a quota system.But it might be difficult to make critics understand this. Unemployment might bepatchy as well as heavy; the brick-making industry, for which Italians are importedin bulk by the Ministry of Labour, might continue to flourish while the industries in which the West Indians have been gladly received underwent a slump. the putting of West Indians on quota while Italians were being imported in bulk wouldmake difficult debating ground.
. 12. The whole trend of post-war policy has been towards the elimination of visas for aliens. To make all British subjects overseas who want to live hereapply for a quota visa might lead to a demand for the general re-imposition ofvisas for aliens a very reactionary step.(3) Administrative difficulties  .13. In its operation the quota is inevitably a very blunt instrument. It takesno heed of individuals, with the result that some very desirable people may be prevented from coming here to live because the quota for New Zealand orTrinidad, or wherever it may be, is filled up for that year.14. The question of excluded classes would produce administrative problems.Such people as students, student-employees, trainees, apprentices, articled clerks,and Fellows, scholars, &amp;c, sponsored by the British Council, Federation of BritishIndustries and international technical assistance bodies, would presumably haveto be excluded from a quota system. The numbers are appreciable. exclusion from quota creates a risk of back-door entry for employment and settlement.15. The quota system would in practice entail the establishment of somethingcorresponding to the visa system in every territory on which a quota was imposed.Staff would have to be recruited, trained and accommodated. The whole system would need to be worked out in advance of the emergence of conditionsnecesitating the quota.General Considerations16. We are of opinion that the balance of advantage is strongly in favourof relying on the method of control provided for in the draft Bill. It seems to us that it could be so operated as to reduce coloured immigration to negligibleproportions. Of course it might be strongly suspected, to put it no higher, that thesystem was being operated in a discriminatory manner, but discrimination wouldnot be so open and direct as is involved in the quota system.17. We would add that the quota system does not seem really appropriate to the circumstances of the United Kingdom at all. Clearly, the intention of a quota system is to permit some measure of immigration while limiting its extent and prescribing its pattern, but the United Kingdom is not an immigration country.Even in the United States, which is the great exemplar of the system, the system has by no means worked out as intended. (Some details of the American and canadian quota systems are given in the Appendix.)18. If, which we doubt, it should prove necessary to provide for more drastic measures than those in the draft Bill, it would be more effective, lamentable as thestep would be from many points of view, to make all entry into the UnitedKingdom, whether by British subjects or foreigners, subject to visa. Such action would be at once more straightforward and more flexible than the imposition ofa quota system and the fixing of low or derisory quotas.Summary of Conclusions19.  A quota system cannot be recommended because, as regards policy:  (1) If it were to serve any purpose at all it would have to be undisguisedlydiscriminatory against coloured people (paragraph 8).(2) It  would   invite   retaliation   by   certain   Commonwealth   countries(paragraph 9). . ,,:(3) It would produce further difficulties about Ireland (paragraph 10).,    (4) It would have repercussions on the administration of the Aliens Order(paragraph 11), ,(5) The existence of a reserve power would expose the Government to constant pressure either to use it or to disclaim the intention of using it in acertain way (paragraph 7).Further, on administrative grounds: -(6) There is no basis on which an overall quota could be satisfactorily fixed(paragraph 5). . ., ,(7) Apportionment among oversea territories has also no scientific basis andin practice could only take a discriminatory form (paragraph 6).51890 c
Home Office, S.W. 1:2nd May, 1957.appendix the Quota System in Canada and the United StatesCanadaCanadian immigration legislation provides for agreements to be made withAsian countries j for quotas of immigrants. The only agreements known to havebeen made are with India, Pakistan and Ceylon. They have allowed for the immigration of 150 citizens of India, 100 citizens of Pakistan and 50 citizens of Ceylon, per annum.;United states. Until 1921 immigration, other than that of Asiatics, was uncontrolled.As a result of political demands the Quota Act was introduced in 1921 as atemporary measure and this was succeeded in due course by the Immigration act of 1924. This act divided immigrants into two classes, quota and non-quota, andthis pattern has been followed ever since although the classes exempted from the quota control have varied from time to time., Under most recent legislation theprincipal categories exempted from the quota control are foreign-born wives andchildren of United States citizens, returning residents, ministers of religion andtheir dependants^ certain employees and retired employees of the United StatesGovernment and persons born in Canada and the Southern and Central american countries.     &apos;  &apos; ;2.   Under the 1924 Act two formulae were laid down for quota immigrants:  (a) The first imposed an overall limit of 165,000 immigrants a year, .140,000of whom were to come from Northern and Western Europe and 20,000from Southern and Eastern Europe. The remaining 5,000 were to benon-Europeans. 11(b) The second formula came into effect in 1929 and with some modificationshas continued until now. It. is based on national origins. The overallquota was fixed at 150,000 a year and the number for each nationalitywas to be a number which bore the same ratio to 150,000 as the numberof persons of that national origin living in the Continental United Statesbore to the total number of United States inhabitants in 1920, non-quotaimmigrants and their dependants and certain other classes (mainlycoloured : persons) being excluded from this total number. , Theminimum quota was 100.3. The purpose of the national origins quota system was to reduce the totalnumber of immigrants in such a way as to preserve the racial and culturalcomposition of the United States population as at the time when immigration from Northern and Western Europe was at its peak. The largest quotas went to the United Kingdom, Germany and Ireland.&apos;. (8), Staff would have to be recruited and trained to operate it in oversea;i: ;-i u territories. Unless this had been done in advance the system could.not:   !;     be brought into operation quickly in a crisis (paragraph 15).(9) The objective of keeping coloured immigration to manageable proportionscould be better achieved by operating the method of control provided in the draft Bill or in the last resort by putting; all immigrants on visa.;    t;     (paragraphs 16-18).. . .,&apos; A!;-&apos;-,Jf    sv   On behalf of the Working Party, !** !&apos; &apos; r&quot; &apos;  &apos;    -(Signed) K.

4. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (the McCarran Act)retained the national origins system for quota immigrants but increased the overallquota to 154,657 (one-sixth of 1 per cent, of the total white population at the 1920Census). It relaxed measures previously operated against certain Asiatic countries and imposed restrictions on territories not previously affected by the quota system.It also imposed quotas for each individual British colonial territory, the total forthe British West Indies being 800.5. The inadequacy of a rigid quota system was exposed after the second world war. To meet their commitments the United States Government was compelled to resort to emergency legislation authorising the admission of displaced persons, refugees, war fiancees, &amp;c. The most important of these measures,involving some 400,000 persons, were the Displaced Persons Acts of 1948 and1950 which kept these persons within the quota framework by a device knownas &quot; quota mortgaging &quot; with the results that the quotas for, e.g., Latvia, Lithuania,Greece and Poland are mortgaged in advance for periods of 318, 134, 61 and 44years respectively, and Congress and the administration have of recent years beenoverburdened by an enormous increase in the number of private relief Bills designedto secure exemption of individuals from having to obtain quota visas.6. It had been intended that about 80 per cent, of the immigrants should comefrom Northern and Western Europe and 16 per cent, from the South and East,but in fact the proportions which came from those areas between 1930 and 1951were 56 per cent, and 42 per cent. The reasons for this were that less than half the quota visas available during this period were actually used, and unused quotas for one country were not allowed to be transferred to another. At August 1952the waiting lists of potential immigrants from the &quot; favoured &quot; countries totalledsome 357,000 (compared with annual quotas totalling 37,000), while large numbersfrom the other countries had been admitted under the Displaced Persons Acts.Thus while the quota system has been effective, or at least had been before thewar, in reducing the total number of immigrants, it has not achieved its original purpose of enforcing a particular balance between the various countries of origin.Nor does this take account of the non-quota immigrants who between 1930 and1951 numbered some 45 per cent, of the total.7. A further weakness of the American system has been its inability to meetlabour emergencies. For instance special legislation had to be enacted in 1950and 1952 to authorise the admission of sheep herders against future quotas.8., In 1953 a Commission appointed by the President reported that, the immigration law was unrealistic and inadequate to the present day situation,particularly as regards the national origins quota system. The Commissionrecommended that a unified quota system should be substituted, that there shouldbe a flexible method of allocating visas to persons in defined categories and thatselection should be made in-such a way as to strengthen the economy and cultureof the United States. Other less drastic proposals for modification of the systemhave since been made by the President, but the British Embassy in Washingtonreported in March 1956 that there was little likelihood of even these proposalsbeing accepted by Congress.
