THE EXTERNAL DEFENCE OF CYPRUS IN CIRCUMSTANCES OFCONDOMINIUMNote by the Secretary of the Chiefs of. Staff Committee .On 26th July, 1957, the Chiefs of Staff approved the report at Annex as an expression of their views.2. In approving the report the Chiefs of Staff wish to draw attention to thetwo following points:  (a) They had concluded that in the circumstances of tri-condominium fullUnited Kingdom responsibility for external defence was probably theleast unsatisfactory arrangement. The question of to whom the UnitedKingdom should be answerable in discharging this responsibility for external defence had however still to be resolved. There appeared tobe three possible solutions:(i) answerable to the tri-condominium government;(ii) answerable to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO);(iii) answerable only to herself.They appreciated that this was essentially a political problem becauseexternal defence and external affairs were inevitably closely linked.However, from the military point of view both (i) and (ii) had serious disadvantages and only (iii) was likely to prove satisfactory.(b) Serious adverse effects on the Baghdad Pact were likely to result if theUnited Kingdom did not assume responsibility for the external defenceof Cyprus.(Signed) D. J. P. LEE.26th July, 1957.THE EXTERNAL DEFENCE OF CYPRUS IN CIRCUMSTANCES OFCONDOMINIUM REPORT TO THE CHIEFS OF STAFFIntroduction1. The Minister of Defence has called for an urgent appreciation of theproblem of the external defence of Cyprus in the circumstances of condominiumgovernment.ThreatGlobal War2. In global war the Russian aim, vis-a-vis Cyprus, would only be to destroyits use as an air base. The threat would consist initially only of an air threat.Should Russian operations be so successful as to enable them to deploy in strength at sea in the Mediterranean and on land on the coasts of Turkey and the Levant,a seaborne assault would be theoretically possible. The Soviet aim however, could still more easily be achieved by air action if, indeed, Cyprus by this time presentedany threat to Russia at all.- We consider, therefore, that the external defence of cyprus is almost wholly a question of air defence with a minor requirement ofdefence against small raiding parties or saboteurs.Limited war. In limited war any threat posed by Syria, Egypt or Israel could similarlyonly be an air threat since a seaborne assault by these countries, even with Russianhelp, is out of the question.Possible Defence Arrangements4. Since it is intended to retain at least one major enclave under full british sovereignty, the defence of this enclave by itself will remain a United Kingdomresponsibility.
5. The external defence of the Island as a whole could be conducted in one of four ways:  (a) Baghdad Pact responsibility.(b) Condominium responsibility under a unified command.(c) NATO responsibility.(d) United Kingdom responsibility (for the whole Island).We discuss the relative merits of these courses below.Relative Merits of Possible Defence ArrangementsBaghdad Pact Responsibility6. Since the main strategic requirement for Cyprus is an air base to supportthe Baghdad Pact, this might seem a logical arrangement. Nevertheless, we cannotenvisage the Greeks agreeing to a system of defence which included the Turks, butnot themselves.   We do not discuss this further.Condominium Responsibility7. In spite of the fact that the condominium government would be responsiblefor internal security, we see great difficulties in it accepting, or indeed being given,responsibility for external defence. Questions of respective force allocation, finance and access to defence facilities in British enclaves would greatly complicate theproblem. Moreover, since all members of the government would be members of nato, a condominium defence would be more logically and conveniently includedin the framework of NATO. Furthermore, this arrangement would not necessarilyprovide for the requirements of Baghdad Pact support. We therefore do not discuss this further.NATO Responsibility8.   There are certain advantages in this. These are: -(a) Since all members of the condominium are members of NATO, it wouldseem the most logical arrangement.(b) The fullest integration of forces would be achieved by this method togetherwith the administrative and material advantages to be gained fromforming part of the NATO structure.(c) It might be the solution most acceptable to the Greek and turkish governments.id) The NATO Powers might be expected to have a certain vested interest in internal security in Cyprus.9.   Against the above there are the following disadvantages:  (a) This arrangement would not necessarily provide for the requirements ofBaghdad Pact support, nor for any of the possible circumstances inwhich British and NATO interests were not identical.(b) Paragraph (a) above could not but reduce our influence in the BaghdadPact.(c) It might also lead to undesirable pressures arising within NATO itself.Full United Kingdom Responsibility10. A system of British enclaves is intended. These enclaves would, in fact,contain almost all the military facilities necessary to the defence of the Island.This alone leads strongly towards the United Kingdom accepting responsibility.Furthermore, this arrangement would avoid possible friction between Greek and turkish interests and would have the added advantage that the Cypriot populationmight accept the presence of British troops more readily if they know them to be wholly responsible for external defence. Finally this is the only arrangement which most nearly allows full freedom to act in defence of the Island in supportof NATO, the Baghdad Pact or British interests.
11. The disadvantage of this plan lies in the fact that a successful defence by one Power, whatever the circumstances of the war, ultimately depends uponat least the passive acquiescence of the other Powers and the local population. Noarrangement can guarantee this in all cases.Conclusions12. We conclude that, in the circumstances of tri-condominium, there is nofully satisfactory arrangement feasible for external defence, but that full UnitedKingdom responsibility for defence is probably the least unsatisfactory.13. We stress that only the retention of full British sovereignty over the wholeIsland can adequately solve the problem of external defence.
