THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. July 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 1531st July, 1957CABINETTHE ROYAL ORDNANCE FACTORIESMemorandum by the Minister of SupplyThere are twenty-three Royal Ordnance Factories (for details see annex), allretained since the 1939-45 war for the dual purpose of providing for the currentneeds of the Services and of furnishing a reserve of capacity in which armsproduction could be quickly expanded in case of need.2. Circumstances have made this number excessive. Current requirements have been reduced and the probability that any major war would, with the use ofthermo-nuclear weapons, be of short duration has diminished the capacity which need be held in reserve; while automatic processes and technical advances havemade it possible to secure the desired output from fewer sites.3. A quick contraction to a lower level of capacity would make for a more economic rate of utilisation and reduce the cost of maintaining unused facilities.The longer contraction is delayed, the worse also for the morale of the R.O.F.organisation.4. As the result of a preliminary assessment of probable demand made in theMinistry of Supply, and while still waiting for full guidance from the Services, Iconsider that the following factories could be closed:  l&quot; Closure to begin immediately.Dismantling of surplus T.N.T. and acid factories to begin immediately. This would be completed in1959. Ammunition breakdown programme tocontinue until then. Entire site would then be disposed of.Closure to take place on completion of present programme, i.e., late 1958.j* Closure to take place probably in 1959-60.5. Of the seven factories listed the closure of the last two is likely to be later in time than that of the other five. A too early notice of closure would be undesirable and I would suggest therefore that an announcement be confined forthe moment to the five.6. The elimination of the seven factories would still, I think, leave a volumeof capacity in excess of what is; likely to be needed. I do not consider, however,that I ought to determine which other factories should also be closed until it hasbeen possible for the Services to give a clearer indication of their requirements. Onthe other hand, I think it important to reach as soon as possible a level of capacity to which we can keep for some time. I hope therefore that the Services will beable to formulate their needs in time for more definitive conclusions to be reached and announced by, at the latest, mid-1958.51828SwynnertonThorp ArchMaltbyIrvineDalmuirWiganPoole
7. Contraction on this or any greater scale will involve terminal expenses,e.g., on decontamination and the dismantling of plant. Capital expenditure willalso be required to provide improved capacity in some of the factories in whichproduction will be concentrated. Detailed proposals will be submitted to theTreasury in the usual way. I expect the cost on both counts to be of the orderof  51 million spread over the next two and a half years. This will largely offsetfor that period the reduction which the closures are likely to effect in current expenditure. Thereafter I would expect expenditure to be lower by about 4 million a year at current prices than it would have been without this contraction.Gross expenditure by the R.O.F.s is estimated at  44 million for this financial year; 40 million for 1958-59 and  36 million for 1959-60.8. The five immediate closures will mean redundancies of about 6,000 overthe next two years in addition to natural wastage; the closure of Poole and Wiganwould bring that figure to about 7,000, and there will be some further reductionsby discharges or wastage in the continuing factories. Total employment in theR.O.F.s on 1st April, 1956, was 47,500. It is now (1st June, 1957) 40,500 and 1expect it to fall to 35,000 at the end of the present financial year and to not morethan 29,000 by October 1959. While the redundancies caused may not be large in any absolute sense, there may well be local difficulties and disproportionateattention may be drawn to them because the people involved are direct government employees.9. What is to happen to R.O.F.s no longer required for defence production?The Opposition will probably press for their retention in State ownership and theirconversion to civil use and especially to the production of equipment for the nationalised industries. Conditions, however, are surely different now from whatthey were immediately after the war, when the factories undertook on a large scalethe production of civil goods in short supply. Not only would a permanentprogramme of civil work necessitate the establishment in the R.O.F.s of newfacilities e.g., for sales, development and design; but further there is scarcely anyfield in which the Government units would not now be adding to existing capacity,without the Government necessarily being able to direct work to its ownorganisation, as it can in defence. The difficulties to which these competitiveconditions and their unequal basis would give rise would be endless.10. If, however, the Government is not to use discarded factories for civil work, it becomes all the more important to endeavour to secure their transfer to industrial concerns. In some cases, e.g., the filling factories at Swynnerton, ThorpArch and the explosives factory at Irvine, the unwanted factories will have fewattractions for private industry. On the other hand, the engineering factories atDalmuir, Maltby and Wigan should prove attractive, and I hope all the resourcesof the Government will be mobilised in trying to effect their lease or sale beforethe problem of re-employment becomes acute.11. As for the factories which must be retained for defence, I shall be undercontinued pressure to make use of the plant and other assets in them by undertaking civil work. This is, I suggest, admissible and within my present powers when: (i) it helps to keep in being the minimum of labour force necessaryfor effective defence production; (ii) it supplements a shortage of appropriatecapacity in industry. I propose that civil work should be undertaken only wheneither of these conditions is met and when it can be done economically with theavailable resources.12.   I seek the agreement of my colleagues to:  (i) an early announcement of the intended closure over the next eighteen months of five factories;(ii) to the preparation of an announcement by, at the latest, mid-1958 offurther closures after which the capacity will have been brought downto a reasonably permanent level;(iii) the undertaking in retained factories of civil work to the extent defined in paragraph W.n.A. J.Ministry of Supply, W.C. 2,28th June, 1957.
