(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 168 COPY NO.    S \17th July, 1957CABINET2 INFLATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will wish to know how I view the problem of inflation and what policies I recommend.    Many factors enter intothe health of the economy and I will comment on the most important of them one by one.GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE2.      This is economically and politically among the most important factors.    Unlike many of the others, it is within our direct control.We made a collective effort to reduce the level of government expenditure this year;  and I am not dissatisfied with the results.There is thus no need, and I certainly have no intention of, embarking on emergency mid-year cuts, still less to impose an all-round increasein charges for welfare services, etc.     Cuts in expenditure may become necessary to keep the growth of expenditure in check, but such measures now would have little practical value and would divert attention from thereal economic issues.3.     Nevertheless the future prospects for Government expenditurelook serious.  There is every sign that, unless we redouble our economy effort, expenditure will rise sharply again in the next fewyears and will far outstrip the rise in revenue.    We must stop thisfrom happening:  not only because to keep Government expenditure at the lowest practicable levels is one of the biggest contributions we can make towards restraining inflation;  but also because our hopes offurther reducing taxation depend almost wholly on our doing so.4.     Our policy, therefore, must be to keep both civil and defence expenditure within the level of the current year&apos;s Estimates, off-setting both the rise in wages and prices and the probabledisappearance of any substantial foreign aid on defence next year byeconomies in other directions.5.     This means that  1,420 millions is the maximum that we shouldspend next year on defence.    The corresponding civil target is 2,650 millions.    On the civil side there are some automatic andinescapable increases and we must find positive reductions to offsetthese.6.     I count on my colleagues most rigorously to scrutinise all their Estimates in this endeavour.-1-
INVESTMENT7.     In the private sector I intend to maintain the credit squeezethrough restriction of bank and consumer credit and the control of borrowing exercised by the Capital Issues Committee.   The squeezeis already severe.    Nevertheless, I am examining some indications that it may be becoming less effective;  and, if that proves to be so,I shall be ready to intensify these measures of control and to considerothers.8.     In the public sector (investment by the central Government,local authorities and nationalised bodies), I do not think that the levelof investment is undesirably high at present.    I certainly think weshould avoid chopping and changing investment programmes on ashort-term basis.     What matters is to take decisions which will secure the right long-term pattern of public investment.    But existing commitments and policies look like producing a growth of about30 per cent ( 300 millions) in this sector over the next five years.In addition, proposals for substantial new commitments on roads,hospitals, schools and the like are continually arising.    We are in danger of entering into excessive long-term commitments, whichwill cramp other claims upon the economy (including private investment)and will frustrate our other objectives, including a sound balance ofpayments and a sound currency.9.     I am reviewing the whole question of the size of our commit-ments in this field and the problem of how to control their growth,and will make proposals to my colleagues in the autumn.    Until I havedone this I ask that no further proposals involving significant increases in public sector investment should be accepted.CAPITAL FROM OVERSEAS10.   There is a world shortage of capital.    Nothing could be morehelpful to this country than to attract capital from overseas to sustainsome part of our investment in the public sector - since this is thearea in which without this the purely financial problem may forcedamaging cuts on us.     One possibility of such help presents itselfat the moment.    Although no details have been discussed, it is possiblethat the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development may be willing to provide capital, on acceptable terms, for some items in the nuclear power programme.    Subject to further discussion of detailswith my colleagues immediately concerned, I would like to pursue this possibility further.CONSUMPTION11.   While we must do everything we can to encourage savings, Ido not think that it would help in our present troubles to restrictconsumption by increasing indirect taxation.PRICES12.   We are in the midst of a round of price increases in the basic industries.    Increased charges for postal and telephone services,steel and transport are still to be announced, and there will have to beconsequential increases elsewhere.    There can be, to my mind, noquestion of seeking to prevent these price increases, which are the inevitable consequence of cost increases.    Indeed to attempt to do so
would only make the situation worse by increasing the pressure of demand and by enabling consumption in real terms to rise.    this increased demand would have to be offset by increased taxation.13.   But we should lose no opportunity of making it clear in public that the source of our inflationary disease is wages increasing out of all proportion to increases in production;  and that we should do only furtherharm by trying to suppress increases in prices which are merelysymptoms of the disease, not its source, as many appear to think.WAGES AND PROFITS14.    Through the Budget and through credit policy I have taken steps which should help the economy to continue in balance.    But the problemof rising costs, and in particular wages, dwarfs everything else.Wage and salary increases added about  900 millions to costs in 1956,and since then there has been a further big batch of increases.    Partof the increase in money incomes may be offset by additionalproductivity in due course;  but the effect of so big an injection of purchasing power into the economy is far more powerful than anything which it is practicable to do to offset it by budgetary and creditmeasures.    It was in recognition and in anticipation of this that I madethe proposals which I did in C. (57) 103.15,   What course should we now pursue?16,    First, we are pressing on with the Council on price stability,productivity and incomes.    At least that body may make some contribution towards the education of the public, including wage tribunals.These problems will, however, be facing us long before it makes its first report.17.    We must use all our influence to prevent further increases in wages and salaries based on the current price rise which is a directconsequence of the last wage round.    The Chairmen of nationalised industries should be told that until further notice they should not concedeany increase in wages direct, or indirect, e. g. through shorter hours.The Government, while not abandoning the &quot;fair wages&quot; and &quot;faircomparisons&quot; principles (which relate Civil Service pay to that incomparable outside occupations) should adopt a similar attitude towardsthe pay of its own servants.    Frivate employers also should be encouraged to look very closely at any proposals which will involveincreased costs.    If this is done employees may either resort to strike action or to arbitration.    If they do the former we must encourageemployers to resist;  if they do the latter, some increases may become inevitable.    But experience shows that arbitrators are showing moreawareness of the needs of the community than is likely to be observed in bi-lateral agreements between employers and workers.18.   If by this policy and through the work of the proposed Councilwe can secure stability in costs over a reasonable time, then therewould be a real hope that we could secure general stability in prices:and there would be an opportunity for the recent unjustified increases in costs to be absorbed by greater productivity.19.     In the weeks and months ahead we shall be having a number of meetings with the various sides of industry.    Suggestions may be madefor the controlling of prices or profits.    We shall have to examine thesebut we need to approach such suggestions with caution.     Profits arenecessary for the investment without which the rising production so
essential to our needs will not take place.    The main difficulty about any bargain at the national level on wages is, however, that it ishard to see how it could be kept.    The Trades Union Congress donot control wage claims.    Nevertheless we must be prepared toconsider measures which may be economically undesirable orpoliticially difficult, if they show any reasonable chance of securingstability in costs and prices.20.    Inflation has been with us for twelve years.    Probably our best chance of checking it is not to be found in an attempt to holdany part of the economy completely rigid.    Our purpose must be tosee that incomes and production move up together.    To this endwe must stick to our fiscal and monetary policies and hold down thelevel of Government expenditure.    We must make it plain that in thefield directly within the area of Government control we are playingour part to the full.    Outside that area we must have the courageboth to state the truth about wages and costs and to stand firm - andso far as our influence permits encourage others to stand firm -against wage demands which go beyond what new production justifies.A solution is not impossible upon these terms.CONCLUSIONS21.    I ask for the assent of my colleagues to the followingpropositions:(a) That we should aim to keep Government expenditurenext year within the total provided in this year&apos;estimates, meeting all inescapable increasesby offsetting economies.(b) That we should maintain and, if necessary,intensify the credit squeeze.(c) That pending a general review on which I shallreport to my colleagues in the autumn, no further proposals involving significant increases in public investment should be accepted.(d) That we should not seek to interfere with price changes which flow from recent increases in costs.(e) That public employers and the nationalised industries should concede no further increases in wages and salaries (direct or indirect) until further notice.P.T.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.16th July, 1957.
