\ -      85(ITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PB.OPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 16417th July, 1957ANGLO-CANADIAN TRADENote by the President of the Board of trade the Prime Minister has asked me to circulate to my colleagues fordiscussion in Cabinet the attached minute and note on Anglo-Canadian trade,,which I had addressed to him.D.E.Board of Trade, S.W.1.16th July, 1957.PRIME MINISTERANGLO-CANADIAN TRADEI should be glad of your instructions.On his return to Canada Mr, Diefenbaker announced his aim toswitch $625 millions of imports from U.S.A. to U. K.    He accused U.S.A.of breaking the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(G.A.T.T.) by subsidising wheat.    Mr. Dulles visits canada on 28th Julypresumably to find out what all this means for U.S.A.Of course the wiseacres *n both sides of the Atlantic sayMr. Diefenbaker&apos;s switch from American imports cannot be done.    Butif he cannot score even a partial success he will be beaten.    We shallget some of the blame, for our people will say we have failed to seizea most exceptional opportunity to increase Anglo-Canadian trade.In these circumstances shall we wait and see if any proposalscome from Ottawa or shall we send Mr. Diefenbaker an encouragingmessage before Mr. Dulles gets there?When the Commonwealth Finance Ministers meet in Canadathey may agree on nothing except to set up study-groups.    If so weshall enter the critical Free Trade Area negotiations with ourimperialists dissatisfied.COPY NO.CABINET
Further, if the Chancellor calls &quot;European Ministers togetherearly in September it would be good for them to know we have a lineout to Canada,1 should therefore like  -(a) to send Mr, Diefenbaker a message that wewould be most interested in discussinghis proposals for Anglo-Canadian trade;(b) to clear our own minds on the basis of adeal from our aide.The paper that follows gives a very rough outline of what might be examined under (b),(Signed)   DAVID ECCLES15th July, 1957.ANGLO-CANADIAN TRADE AGREEMENT1954 1955 1956  million.   United Kingdom Importsfrom Canada 273 344 348United Kingdom Exports 132 141 178to CanadaBalance 141 203 1702. It is assumed that Canada does not contemplate action contraryto G.A.T.T. or openly discriminatory against the U.S.A.    If this assumption proves wrong - and Mr, Diefenbaker is loudly accusingthe U.S.A. of breaking G.A.T.T,  -  then we shall have to think beyond this paper.3, Canada could do the following for the United Kingdom(a) Re-establish guarantees of preference, thus undoingthe 1947 agreement between the Liberal Governmentin Canada and the Labour Government here.(b) Restore a certain number of our preferences (to theextent permissible under the G.A.T.T.) in caseswhere Canada has reduced the most favoured nation(m.f. n.) rates but not reduced the British Preferencerate by the same amount.
(c) Re-affirm the Canadian preference on west indian sugar.(d) Bind some of her tariff rates on some products of special importance to us, i. e. remove the fear of our manufacturers that these ratesmay be raised to protect Canadian industries.4.   .      The United Kingdom could do the following for Canada:-(a) Re-affirm our present commitment to accord free entry to Canada on all the goods on which ourmvf. n. rate is bound under the G.A.T.T.(b)Guarantee margins of preference for goods ofimportance to Canada, as in the Ottawa agreement,but with a waiver for countries of the European free trade Area.(c) Declare our intention to maintain unrestricted entry for Canadian wheat even when in balance of payments difficulties.(l am advised we should not offer to join the wheat agreement but I should have thought that if theminimum price were low enough there was a case for doing so).5. The two sets of points outlined above may not be enough for mr. Diefenbaker.    They are small changes in the framework of trade.What about trade itself?    Is there anything in the nature of shoppinglists to be exchanged?    The answer turns on what Canada is preparedto give us, e. g. what imports from the United Kingdom can be steppedup as a result of action by the Canadian Government.    (One thing theymight do would be to see that our firms get special opportunities to compete successfully for Canadian Government contracts).    The ballis in Mr. Diefenbaker&apos;s court.6. If Mr. Diefenbaker can do enough for us, we may have toconsider what more we can do for him.    Canada would like us to relax our balance of payments restrictions.    The following itemswould cost relatively little and would help Canada without giving muchaway to the U.S.A.:-(a) Apples:     there is a quota on dollar apples ofwhich Canada takes 70 per cent.    It could onlybe increased at the expense of either home growersor the European quota.    Either would be very difficult.(k) Cheese;     Canada takes nearly all the dollar quota of 1,5 millions.    We could put cheese on Open GeneralLicence (O.G.L.) and probably very little more would come in.(c) Newsprint:     the Canadians would appreciate theremoval of the quota and it would probably cost usnothing.
(d) Salmon -   Fresh and Frozen:    to put this onO.G.L.. would cost about  250,000 a year.(e) Canned Salmon:      Canada takes 80 per cent ofthe dollar quota of  3.5 millions.    We might increase this quota.    The British public verymuch like canned salmon.Board of Trade, S.W.1.15th July, 1957.
