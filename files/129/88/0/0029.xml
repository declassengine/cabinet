Printed for the Cabinet. July 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 17925th July, 1957CABINETBETTING AND GAMING bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andLord Privy SealOn 6th June the Cabinet invited me to circulate a memorandum reviewing thearguments for proceeding with the Betting and Gaming Bill in the forthcoming session (C.C. (57) 45th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. Since then I have had a meeting with the Party Committee on Home OfficeAffairs, during which it became clear that there is no enthusiasm amongback-benchers for legislation on this subject next session. Although the members who spoke recognised that the existing state of the law is very unsatisfactory, theywere concerned about the difficulties of a system of licensed betting offices on thelines recommended by the Royal Commission on Betting, Lotteries and Gaming,1949-51, and foresaw determined opposition not only from religious organisations,but also from the bookmakers (who regard legislation of cash betting off thecourse as the first step towards taxation) and from the horse-racing interests, if theBill did not contain a provision requiring bookmakers to make a financial contribution to the cost of conducting horse-racing.3. As the Minister responsible for putting forward proposals to my colleaguesabout the contents of the Parliamentary programme, I would feel bound, in thelight of the views expressed at this meeting, to advise that it would be better notto proceed with this Bill next session. There are, however, other important considerations to which, as Home Secretary, I must give due weight and on whichI would welcome the views of my colleagues.4. If we were to decide not to proceed with this Bill v/e must be prepared toaccept the following consequences:  (a) We should have to explain why we are unable to put forward any proposalsfor legislation some 18 months after a pledge was given by theGovernment spokesman in the Debate in the House of Commons on 9th March, 1956, that the Government accepted the main recommendations of the Royal Commission^ Report and intended tointroduce legislation at the earliest practicable opportunity. Moreoverif the findings of a Royal Commission are ignored it will become increasingly difficult to find suitable members to serve on suchCommissions. My colleagues wilL remember the protests which havealready been voiced publicly by Sir Henry Willink who was theChairman of the Royal Commission.(b) Illegal facilities for betting would continue to be provided by streetrunners and, in some parts of the country, in illegal betting shops.(c) The enforcement of the law, which the Royal Commission described as&quot; little more than a formality,&quot; will probably become increasinglyineffective.51961
Home Office, S.W.1,24th July, 1957.(d) There will be continued risk of undesirable relationships between the police and bookmakers, with the possibility of the payment of gratuities orbribes. It is not often possible to obtain evidence to sustain a criminalprosecution for corruption or disciplinary proceedings against apoliceman, but the opinion of chief officers of police is that opportunities for corruption undoubtedly exist. There was a scandal in Leeds notmany years ago, which may well be repeated elsewhere.(e) A situation will continue in which the law is so far out of line with currentopinion and practice that general respect for the law, and relationsbetween the police and sections of the public, are impaired. Inparticular the criticism will not be stilled that there is one law for therich and another for the poor (viz., legal credit betting and illegal cashbetting).(/) It will probably remain impracticable to obtain any revenue from bettingon horse-racing until cash betting off the course is legalised.(g) It would be politically out of the question for the Government to tackle the gaming laws without dealing with the problem of cash betting, andthese too would have to be left in their present very unsatisfactory state,in which virtually all forms of gaming are illegal and the police decide which they are prepared to tolerate.5. A further consideration which we must bear in mind is that if we announce a decision not to proceed with the Bill this may affect negotiations which are atpresent going on between the horse-racing interests and the bookmakers about thepossibility of a voluntary contribution by bookmakers towards the costs of horse-racing. The Home Affairs Committee on 15th April agreed that it wouldbe preferable not to include in the Bill any provisions for a compulsory levy onbookmakers (H.A. (57) 10th Meeting, Item 3), and I see no reason to reconsiderthis decision. I am informed that there is some possibility that the bookmakersmight be prepared to make a voluntary contribution but that there would be little likelihood of this once they knew that there was no prospect of legislation to makeoff-course cash betting legal.6. If a Bill is introduced, discussion of its numerous controversial features islikely to be complicated, protracted and unrewarding. Therefore the Bill willfounder unless we are firmly determined to see it through.7.   In this somewhat complex situation, we can either (a) decide now to drop the Bill but defer any announcement of our intention; or(b) proceed with the drafting of the Bill and decide at a later stage whether we wish to include it in the programme for next session or to mention itin The Queen&apos;s Speech.8. If we decide to omit the Bill from The Queen&apos;s Speech and this is strongly criticised so that pressure for legislation develops, we could consider eitherintroducing the Bill later in the session, or possibly (if a decision could be takenearly enough) getting a private Member to introduce the provisions dealing withgaming. Technically these can be entirely separated from the provisions legalisingcash betting off the course, but we should have to consider, when a draft is ready,whether it would be desirable to proceed with them separately and if so whethera private Member should be asked to tackle such a complicated and controversialsubject.R. A. B.
