Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1957SECRET Copy No. 5 7C (57) 1923rd September, 1957CABINETWESTERN EUROPEAN UNION : INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL FOR THEPROTECTION OF PRIVATE INTERESTS WHICH MAY SUFFERDAMAGE FROM THE OPERATIONS OF THE ARMS CONTROLAGENCYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs for the past year Western European Union (W.E.U.) has been engaged in drafting a Convention to establish an international Tribunal for the above purpose,in pursuance of Article XI of Protocol No. IV of the Agreements signed in Parison October 23, 1954. This Article contemplates the provision of &quot; due process oflaw in respect of private interests.&quot; Until this Tribunal is established, the Agency,to which we attach considerable importance, cannot inspect privately-ownedfactories.2. The Tribunal is to have its seat in Luxembourg and its Judges will be selected from a panel comprising the six Judges of the already established Courtof the European Coal and Steel Community and one United Kingdom judge. Itis unlikely that any British claimants will appear before it since the Agency&apos;operations are confined to the mainland of Europe. Gibraltar would be includedbut there are in fact no private factories there producing armaments subject tocontrol.3. A copy of the latest draft of the Convention is attached (GT/ACA/46).This is now agreed on all points of substance with the exception of Article XVIII,which deals with the privileges and immunities to be accorded to the Judges ofthe proposed Tribunal, its Clerk and his staff, and Counsel appearing before it. TheUnited Kingdom has been alone in refusing to accept this Article, which requires the grant of an unusually wide range of privileges and immunities (so far, at least,as the Judges are concerned). It presents no problem to our W.E.U. allies since itmerely repeats the privileges and immunities already granted to the European coal and Steel Community (E.C.S.C.) Judges under the E.C.S.C. Agreement. indeed they have strenuously resisted our attempt to modify it; they particularly objectto any differentiation in the treatment accorded to their Judges when acting in either capacity. The major difficulty for us is the requirement of immunity forthe Judges from all legal process.4. This Article has been considered at length by the Working Party onPrivileges and Immunities of the Cabinet Steering Committee on international organisations and has been the subject of correspondence between the HomeSecretary, the Lord Chancellor and myself. The conclusion which we reached andwhich I now submit to the Cabinet for approval is that, in view of the importanceof ensuring an early start to the full operation of the Agency, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment might reluctantly agree to accept Article XVIII, provided that an amendment were introduced limiting the immunity required to be granted to theUnited Kingdom Judge to immunity in respect of actions carried out in the courseof his official duties. This would not, of course, affect the immunity of the othersix (non-British) Judges but in practice there seems no obvious reason why they52175 b
should need even to visit this country in their official capacity. If my colleagues agree, I propose to inform W.E.U. that we can accept Article XVIII but on thebasis that the immunity of the United Kingdom Judge is limited as indicated above.5. The Netherlands Delegation have recently proposed a new Article forinsertion in the draft Convention making the Judges, Clerk and staff of theTribunal subject to taxation by W.E.U. under the scheme already existing in w.E.U. It is intended that the United Kingdom Delegation should support thisproposal.6. I have consulted the Attorney-General on the question whether an act of Parliament will be necessary to enable effect to be given in the United kingdom to those parts of Article XVIII (and Article XIII, which deals with the collectionof evidence) which seem at all likely to require action by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment. He has advised me that it will not. An Order in Council under theInternational Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950, will, however,be needed to extend the required Immunities and Privileges to the Judges and tothe Clerk and to his staff, if after discussion in the W.E.U. Council it should benecessary to give them any privileges here.7.   I therefore seek the approval of my colleagues to (a) the course of action proposed in paragraph 4 above; and(b) the Submission to Parliament in due course of a draft Order in Councilbased on Article XVIII of the Convention.S.
