Appendix a proposed TRIPARTITE conference it is essential that the conference should be regarded as a genuine attempt toreach a solution of the problem. If this is to be achieved we must secure thefullest possible degree of support from the United States Government, without which indeed it may not be possible even to bring both the Greek and turkish governments to the table. It is no less important to secure the co-operation ofM. Spaak.2. With this in view we should make it clear to the Americans and toM. Spaak that we earnestly wish to settle the problem and are therefore anxiousto have an early and serious discussion of all types of solution which have beenconsidered in the past or which any of the parties may wish to put forward, andthat for their part Her Majesty&apos;s Government have not made up their minds for or against any particular solution. It must be understood, however, that theycould not regard any solution as acceptable which did not (i) allow them to retain their minimum essential military facilities under british sovereignty;(ii) protect the island from Communist infiltration;(iii) ensure peace and tranquillity in the island as a whole.3. As regards our own proposals for a condominium there is a danger thatif we mention them to the Americans now they may regard them merely as a deviceto torpedo their favourite idea of independence, and also that if they leaked theywould be regarded, more especially by the Greeks, as the solution favoured by her majesty&apos;s Government from the outset and as such to be resisted. On the otherhand, it might well be regarded as disingenuous if Her Majesty&apos;s Government wereto table their new proposals during the conference without any preliminarywarning. That would certainly be the case if Her Majesty&apos;s Government let theconference take place, and break down, and produced these proposals subsequently.The best course may therefore be to mention the general idea of condominium andthe possibility of triple nationality to the Americans among the solutions whichhave in fact, been considered in the past and subsequently to endeavour to guide the discussion at the conference table so that our proposals emerge as the logicalway out of the impasse.4. Our readiness in principle to hold a conference and the importance of support from the United States Government and M. Spaak might first be mentioned to the Turkish Government. Discussions with the Americans andM. Spaak on the basis indicated above should then show whether the idea of aconference is worth pursuing. On the assumption that the outcome is favourableit would no doubt be advisable to speak in a preliminary way also to the GreekGovernment. At an appropriate stage it might be politic to remind the TurkishGovernment that, though independence was among the solutions which would haveto be discussed, nevertheless we were well aware of the objections to it. At thesame time we should not allow the Turkish Government to set any conditions totheir participation in the conference, for example by insisting on some commitmentby Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the matter of partition. Thereafter formalinvitations would be issued. We should aim to complete this preliminary process by about 1st August.5. The invitations to the conference should presumably make it clear thatthe object of the conference is to discuss the international status of Cyprus and to test the practicability of any proposals which have been or may be put forward in the hope of reaching a peaceful, democratic and just solution. The invitationswould also make it clear that a settlement of the international aspects of the problem would be followed by early discussions with Cypriot representatives on the internalaspects.6. The conference should clearly be held in London and will require fiveto six weeks of preparation and consultation, which would mean that it could notbe held before the early part of September. This timing may be criticised(especially by the Greeks) as an attempt to forestall discussion of Cyprus at the
Appendix BENCLAVES TO BE RETAINED UNDER BRITISH SOVEREIGNTYAND TREATY RIGHTS REQUIRED IN AREA OF THREE-FOWERCONDOMINIUM1.   Delineation of Enclaves (see attached map)(a) Akrotiri and EpiskopiThis enclave would contain the Akrotiri airfield, Episkopicantonment and Paramali wireless station. It could be made self-supporting in emergency for water and power.(b) Dhekelia and PergamosThe Dhekelia section, containing the Army administrativeestablishments, covers an area of about 1  by 2 miles.If these two areas were joined and made into one enclave, it would be self-supporting,Dhekelia containing the civilian power station and Pergamos anadequate water supply.(e) Nicosia AirfieldUnless we are to accept serious restriction of the bomber potential of Akrotiri, a second airfield is necessary to provide emergencyfacilities and to accommodate fighter and transport aircraft. Nicosiais the only airfield available to meet these requirements. From themilitary point of view, therefore, this airfield, with its operational andadministrative installations should be retained as an enclave under british sovereignty. Greek, Turkish and other aircraft would of course be allowed facilities there.(d) Ayios NikolaosThis would be an enclave of about H miles by 1 mile and will contain the R.A.F. Receiving and MessageCentre, and the ordnance depot.(e) HeraklisThis enclave would contain the R.A.F. Transmitting Station,occupying an area of   mile square.(f) Cape Greco and Cape KormakitiThese are promontories which contain early warning equipment for the air defence of the Island.(g) Mount TroodosThis is a radar homing beacon for R.A.F. aircraft.ih) Broadcasting facilities the Foreign Office wish to retain as enclaves the three broadcastinginstallations marked &quot; B&quot; on the map which are necessary fortransmissions to the Arab world..,. -2.

THE ORIGINAL WRETAINED UNDER SECTION 3 (4)OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACTUnited Nations, which convenes in mid-September. Nevertheless, the balance ofadvantage lies in allowing adequate time for preparation. The Governments of^jt&amp;gSjjgse and Turkey would be invited to send delegations; the United States wouldibteinwited to send observers; and M. Spaak would be invited to attend in person.The interval between acceptance of the invitations and the start of the conference would be occupied by preparatory discussions with the four parties concerned on a bilateral basis.
tTjjSISA COPY. THE OS6INAI iS 1I RETAINED UNDER SECTION 3 (4:[OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS AC;Local Population of British Enclaves4. The enclaves proposed in paragraph 1 have been so devised as to includethe minimum number of local inhabitants. Tf it is considered that to allow these to remain in the enclaves will give rise to security problems or an eventual claimto self-determination, they could be moved out of the enclaves and paidcompensation.Treaty Facilities5. A number of facilities will require to be assured to the British forces inthe Treaty setting up the condominium. The main ones are the following:  (a) unfettered communication to, and between,&apos; the enclaves for the movementof stores, supplies and personnel;(b) the right to fly military aircraft over the whole island, together with theright (for air defence purposes) to be informed of all civil movements in the area;(c) the right to maintain personnel at ports and airfields for the control and movement of Servicemen and freight, meteorological duties and air-searescue;(d) the use of public services, utilities (telecommunications, post, power,water, sewage, &amp;c.) and other facilities;(e) facilities for training in agreed areas.6. The foregoing represents an outline of what would be required under theproposed condominium arrangements. Further detailed study will, of course, benecessary.appendix c  -CYPRUS: CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUESreport by officialsGeneralThe Cabinet discussions have referred to the need for some ultimate sanctionagainst the possibility that the three Governments concerned might fail to agreeamong themselves. We consider that, if the three Governments accept the idea ofcondominium initially, they will do so with a full realisation of the possible consequences and that thereafter their prestige and their interests (including in&quot; interests &quot; the risk of retaliation against their own nationals outside Cyprus) willcompel them to make an honest effort to work the arrangement. The suggestions in the following paragraphs are based on the assumption of good will between thethree co-domini.The role of N.A.T.O.2. The North Atlantic Council acts by unanimous decision&quot;. It is thereforeunrealistic to regard N.A.T.O. as a kind of court of higher instance which couldresolve the problems on which the three co-domini were in disagreement. It ispossible that N.A.T.O. could be induced to waive the unanimity rule in certain cases; but we think that, in practice, this is very unlikely to happen. Neither theGreek nor the Turkish Government, to say nothing of other members of N.A.T.O.,would be likely to agree to such an innovation. Again we do not rule out entirelythe possibility of N.A.T.O. agreeing to assume some permanent supervisoryresponsibility in connection with the government of the Island; but suchresponsibility would have to be clearly defined in a contractural document, and here too we consider that the necessary agreement would not in practice be forthcoming.

3.   The most that could be expected of N.A.T.O., therefore, is probably thatit should agree:  , (a) to the inclusion of Cyprus in the N.A.T.O. area (see paragraph 8 below);(b) to express its concern and to take a continuing interest in the working ofthe condominium.It is also for consideration whether, despite the difficulty referred to in paragraph2 above, N.A.T.O. should be asked to select the Governor in the event of the threeco-domini being unable to agree.The Governor4. The Governor, whether selected by the three co-domini or, in default oftheir agreement, by N.A.T.O., would be appointed by the three co-domini jointlyand would be responsible to them for his discharge of all his functions, includingthe reserved functions of external affairs, defence and internal security. If N.A.T.O.agreed to select a Governor in the event of disagreement between the threeco-domini, it might similarly be able to act as arbiter if they could not agree on hisremoval.   &apos;5. The Governor would be assisted by an Advisory Council, composed ofrepresentatives of the three co-domini resident in Cyprus. In addition, there mustbe adequate arrangements for consultation between the co-domini themselves.This could be provided in the shape of a three-Power Council, meeting in rotationin each of the three capitals. It should hold formal and regular meetings, and itshould be constituted in such a way as to facilitate rapid decisions. It might appropriately consist of a Minister of the Power in whose capital it happened tobe meeting, together with the resident Ambassadors of the. other two Powers. Itshould also have its own secretariat, though this would preferably be based on one of the three capitals only. In general, the more the machinery of consultation between the three Governments can be formalised, the better.6. The Governor^ powers would be defined, as regards the internal administration of the Island, by the Radcliffe Constitution, amended as necessary.As regards the reserved subjects, we envisage arrangements on the following lines:  External Affairs7. All decisions relating to the Island&apos;s external affairs would have to command the assent of each of the co-domini. Failing such assent, the status quowould be maintained. The procedure in any such matters not covered by the governors standing instructions agreed between the co-domini would be for him,in the first instance, to consult the representatives in Cyprus of the three Powers;if they failed to agree, he would have to refer the question either to the council for joint consideration or to the three Governments separately; if it still proved impossible to reach agreement, any fresh initiative on the question at issue wouldbe suspended, and the status quo would prevail.Defence8. &quot;If N.A.T.O. agreed to include Cyprus in the N.A.T.O. area, an attack onthe Island from outside would bring the alliance into play with the consequentapplication of the principle of collective defence. From the military point of view,there would be considerable advantage in an arrangement whereby, with the consentof the co-domini, the primary responsibility for the defence of Cyprus continuedto rest with the United Kingdom. N.A.T.O. might, however, ask for facilities eitherwithin or outside our enclaves. In the former case, the matter would be one for agreement between ourselves and N.A.T.O; in the latter, it would be for agreementbetween N.A.T.O. and the three sovereign Governments.9. In practice, no great difficulty should arise, since an external threat to the island would be likely to develop only in the event of outright war, whether globalor limited, in conditions which would give the United Kingdom and the othermembers of N.A.T.O. a common interest in protecting Cyprus against attack.10. It is, however, implicit in an arrangement of this kind that N.A.T.O..would accept responsibility for an Island incorporating enclaves of British territory
from which we might wish to operate in a context other than N.A.T.O. itself e.g.,under the Bagdad Pact or in defence of direct United Kingdom interests. So far as concerns the Bagdad Pact this might be argued to have certain advantages in providing a more direct link between N.A.T.O. and the Pact. On the other hand,it might not be very welcome to certain members of N.A.T.O.Internal Security11. For the purpose of discharging his responsibility for internal security the Governor would have available:  (a) A police force, composed mainly of Greek and Turkish Cypriots butpresumably including a leavening of British and mainland Greek and turkish elements; and(b) an Internal Security Force, composed of equal contingents of British,Greek and Turkish troops, which would be fully integrated under a unified command.The Commanding Officer of the Internal Security Force would be appointed by,and responsible to, the Governor. He would be selected by the three co-domini or,failing agreement between them, by N.A.T.O. (At a later stage consideration might be given to the raising of an international force for internal security purposeson a basis of voluntary recruitment, which could perhaps replace the tripartiteforce in due course.)12. It would not appear to be a practical arrangement for N.A.T.O. to beempowered to intervene to restore order in the Island. It is unlikely that the member Governments would agree to take on this responsibility. Moreover,unless they had a standing N.A.T.O. force available in the Island, the situation might well get completely out of hand before they could intervene.13. There appear, therefore, to be only two ways of approaching the crucial question of the Governors functions in connection with internal security:  (a) If the new arrangements for the Island as a whole are based on an assumption of fundamental agreement and co-operation between theco-domini, the Governor, in taking such action as was necessary toestablish and maintain internal security, would presumably be able to rely on the consent of the three sovereign Powers, either at the levelof the resident Advisory Council or, if necessary, by reference to thethree co-domini themselves. The risk involved in this course is that agreement would not, in fact, be achieved at either level. In that case,the whole arrangement would break down.(b) Alternatively, the arrangement could, from the outset, incorporate somespecific provision against this eventuality. Since we have already ruled out recourse to N.A.T.O. and regard it as unlikely that the GreekGovernment would accept any arrangement whereby the governor would be empowered to act with the consent of a majority of theco-domini, such a provision could only take the form of a standingauthority from the co-domini to the Governor to act in his owndiscretion both in an emergency, when there was no time to consult the three co-domini and in any case in which, having consulted them,he was unable to secure agreement between them. It must berecognised, however, that, although an authority of this kind might be effective in securing internal order, there could be no assurance that,when it came to the point, one or more of the contingents of the internal security Force in which the Governor would have to rely would not be withdrawn or immobilised by the Governments who were in disagree-ment with this proposed course of action. There could also be no assurance that a Governor who succeeded in acting on his ownauthority would not carry out policies direct inimical to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment.14. The choice between these two courses is essentially a political one. Butwe find it difficult to conceive that an individual would either be. willing to acceptappointment as Governor or be able, after appointment, to discharge his functions
effectively unless he were given some power to act on his own discretion in theevent of an emergency. The precise limits of such independent action would need further consideration; but it might not be impossible to secure agreement amongthe three co-domini on a workable definition. Beyond those limits, however, his action would need to rest on agreement between the three co-domini; and this factmust be frankly faced.
