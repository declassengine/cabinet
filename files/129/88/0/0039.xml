secret.(57) 189 COPY NO. ^ 2.26th August, 1957CABINETWELFARE ORANGE JUICEMemorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of health on 31st July, the Home Affairs Committee considered the scope ofthe welfare orange juice scheme and the subsidy provided for it(HA.(57) 19th Meeting, Item 3), following the publication on 30th July ofthe report on Welfare Foods of a Joint Sub-Committee of the English and scottish Standing Medical Advisory Committees, under the chairmanship of Lord Cohen of Birkenhead.    This report recommended that welfareorange juice should continue to be provided as at present for children under two and for expectant mothers,but the Sub-Committee (with two dissentients)recommended its discontinuance for children between the ages of two and five on the grounds that they receive an adequate supply of vitamin C fromtheir diet.2.     In a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and theParliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Health (HA.(57) 100) the agreementof the Home Affairs Committee was sought to five proposals which are set out below together with the Committee&apos;s conclusions:-(1)   &quot;the supply of subsidised welfare orange juice to childrenover two being discontinued as recommended by themajority of the Cohen Committee&quot;The Committee agreed that steps should be taken towithdraw the issue of welfare orange juice to childrenbetween the ages of two and five, subject to considera-tion of the question whether this was likely to involvethe Exchequer in significant additional expenditure insupport of the West Indian citrus industry.    TheCommittee invited the Financial Secretary to theTreasury to arrange for officials of the Treasury,Colonial Office, Ministry of Agriculture and Ministryof Health to consider this point and to report theirfindings to the Home Secretary before 1st September.(2)  &quot;tokens already issued when the change is effected remainingvalid until their normal expiry date&quot;The Committee discussed a suggestion that suchtokens should be declared invalid after a specifieddate but considered that this would impose anunjustifiable burden on the voluntary workers who
distribute orange juice at some 10,000 centres.    they invited me to consider what practical steps might betaken to invalidate coupons already issued when the restricted scheme came into force.(3)  &quot;the change taking place either on 1st November or, if itis necessary to give more time for a debate in Parliament,on, say, 1st January, 1958&quot;The general sense of the meeting was in favour of early action and confirmation has since been obtainedfrom the members of the Committee that they agree tothe change coming into effect on 1st November.(4)  &quot;an anaouncement being made before*e tke beginning ofOctober, either immediately by a written answer to aQuestion, or in September through the Press&quot;The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs asked thatthe announcement of any decision to restrict the scheme should be deferred until the comments of the west indian producers had been received and considered andthis was accepted.(5)   &quot;that there should be no increase in the price charged fororange juice at the present time&quot;The reasons put forward for leaving the present price to beneficiaries at 5d. a bottle were:-(i)  That it would be very difficult politically todefend imposing additional charges inrespect of welfare foods so soon after the increases in milk prices last April,particularly as the savings (about  200,000in the current financial year and  800,000in a full year) would be relatively minorcompared with the saving of  14,000,000a year on milk.(ii)  Parents of growing children have also had tomeet a number of other increases in feedingcosts recently.(iii)  Removal of the Exchequer subsidy would resultin the price of orange juice being increased from 5d. to Is. 6d. a bottle and a large fallin consumption would almost certainly follow.This would be very difficult to justify in viewof the findings of the Welfare Foods Committeethat &quot;the clinical evidence provides stronggrounds for concluding that a source of vitamin Cshould be provided for children up to the ageof two, and we recommend that the provisionof welfare orange juice should be continued at the present level to this age group&quot;.
Indeed, the Welfare Foods Committee felt that thepossibility of improving the present distributionarrangements should be kept under constant review in view of the low uptake of welfarefoods.3.     The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs also expressed thehope that the subsidy would remain at its present level and pointed outthat the financial consequences in terms of Exchequer support for theWest Indies industry of a further fall in consumption were unpredictable.4.      The Home Affairs Committee agreed that no change should bemade simultaneously in the subsidy of welfare orange juice.5.     The following action has been taken in furtherance of theCommittee&apos;s conclusions(1)    The position of the West Indies citrus industry has beenconsidered by officials and it appears unlikely that adecision to restrict welfare orange juice to children under two will lead to any additional expenditure insupport of the industry.(2)   Arrangements are being made by the Ministry ofPensions to bring the change into effect from 1st November, subject to the Home Secretary givingon 1st September a decision on the West Indies asforecast above.As the token books of about 1,400,000 children overthe age of three are due for renewal during themonth of October, it will be necessary for theGovernments decision to be announced before 1st October in order that any further supply oftokens for use after 1st November may be with-held.(3)    No practicable way has been found of invalidatingtokens already issued and this has been reportedto the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.J.K. V.-M.Mini&quot;ti-y of Health, W. 1.26th August, 1957.
