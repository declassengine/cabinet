(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.(57) 16918th July, 1957MALTAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesWhen Mr. Mintoff broke off negotiations in London in April, he told his supporters that a United Kingdom Minister would have to come tohim in Malta to resume them.   He has since thought better of this.   Lastmonth, he sent his Attorney General here to see whether we would resume negotiations.   Now, having got no response from us, he has come overhimself and has asked to see me tomorrow afternoon.2.      I judge this - even under the guise of medical treatment - as aclimb-down by Mr. Mintoff and a retraction of his previous attitude enequivalence.   I think we should respond accordingly.   It would be unnecessary and petty to insist on his approaching us formally and mean-while to refuse to see him.3.      But I do not believe that Mr. Mintoff can be got to accept theproposals we made to him in April without some changes.   In ordertherefore to prevent a constitutional crisis arising in Malta over the breakdown of negotiations on integration, I consider that, providedMr. Mintoff is prepared to make it clear in a letter - which I would be free to publish later - that he no longer insists that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should guarantee the attainment of economic equivalencewe should be ready to consider certain changes of detail in our proposals.4.      There need be no final commitment at this stage on the actualwording or scope of the changes.   There would be ample time to consider them before resumption of formal negotiations, which cannot be until september.   The sort of changes I have in mind would be verbalamendments to the preamble of the proposed economic arrangements which would not alter their effect; increased percentage grants for education, a substantial part of which might be allocated to training of maltese apprentices in this country; and provision for a biennialcommission to review progress made in Malta.5.     Agreement on these lines would be well worth having.   It would avoid adding to our problems in the Mediterranean, would facilitatesettlement of many outstanding administrative issues and possibly evena solution of Malta&apos;s economic problems by opening the way forMaltese emigration, within the United Kingdom quota, to the U.S.A.(I had a very useful talk with Mr. Menzies today about Maltese emigrationto Australia. )COPY NO.wf^CABINET
6.      Mr. Mintoff is a clever and determined negotiator.   Agreementnow will not avoid future difficulties with him.   But the chance of asettlement, almost exactly on the basis Her Majesty&apos;s Government have proposed, should not be thrown away through my not having authoritywhen I see Mr, Mintoff to explore the chances of reaching agreement on the basis of limited concessions of this kind.   I therefore seek mycolleagues1 authority to explore these points in discussion withMr. Mintoff if, and only if, he agrees in writing to drop the demand forguaranteed economic equivalence.A.L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W.I.17th July, 1957
