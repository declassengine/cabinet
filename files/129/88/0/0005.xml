THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 1551st July, 1957CABINETDEFENCE programme memorandum by the Minister of SupplyMy colleagues may like to have an assessment of some of the probable effectsin industry during the next few years of the decisions announced in the defence white Paper so far as they concern the Ministry of Supply. This assessment will,of course, be affected by any further changes that may be made in the defencedevelopment and production programmes. There are separate memoranda onthe aircraft industry (C. (57) 154) and the Royal Ordnance Factories (C. (57) 153)on which decisions are required.2. The effects of the cuts, have so far been mild, and they are likely to become fully apparent only over the&apos; next two to three years. On the research anddevelopment side, defence firms, while abstaining from new recruitment, appearto be striving to maintain the strength of their teams of technologists in the hopeof getting some new military design work in the relatively near future. this situation cannot, however, last very long. On the production side, the heaviestcuts have occurred on conventional weapons, but requirements for these had beenshrinking for several years, and the impact of the further reductions has so far been fairly easily absorbed. The decline in aircraft production is likely to be a fairly gradual process.3. The Aircraft Industry. The industry most severely affected is the aircraft industry, and the outlook seems bleak for considerable sections, though there arestill several decisions to be taken which could materially affect the prospects ofcertain firms. When the future size of the aircraft programme is finally settled,the Cabinet may wish for a further report on the size and shape of the industry.As things stand at the moment, the following firms will virtually disappearduring the next few years from the aircraft industry:  Hawkers (Kingston and Blackpool)Hawkers are traditionally manufacturers of fighter aircraft. They haveuntil now maintained their design strength of 330 by work on their privateventure fighter, but, in view of the new defence policy, they have decided notto continue with this. Consequently, in the absence of any new work, theirdesign staff is likely to fall to about 80 in two years&apos; time. On the productionside, they have already announced their intention to give up the Blackpoolfactory. About half its labour force of 3,500 have been found jobs elsewhere,but absorption of the remainder, most of whom are due to go by the end ofthis year, may prove difficult. There is as yet no alternative use for this,a Government-owned factory, which is a modern plant of 1  million square feet specially designed for aircraft production.With the decline in Hunter production, there has already been a sharprun-down in Kingston from about 4,800 in May 1956 to about 3,300 now,though the dismissed workers seem so far to have found other employmentfairly readily. Any further decline may be postponed for two years or so,but will thereafter be rapid.51837
Gloster Aircraft Company (Gloucester)There is no future aircraft design work in sight for this firm, and with the running down of that on the Javelin, the design staff of 500 is likely to behalved in the next two years, while the total labour force of about 5,200 willprobably be down to about 2,000 by early 1959. This reduction, togetherwith the discharge from Armstrong Siddeley&apos;s neighbouring factory discussedbelow, may at worst mean total labour redundancies in the Gloucester areaof the order of 5,000 during the next two years or so.Armstrong Siddeley (Coventry and Brockworth (Gloucester))This firm will probably lose half their design staff of 850 in the next two years. Their one major long-term project, the engine for the supersonicbomber, has been cancelled. As a result 800 industrials engaged on R. &amp; D.contracts have been, or are about to be, declared redundant, and the firmexpect to discharge up to 700 more within the next four months. The total labour force on Ministry of Supply contracts is 7,000 at Coventry and 3,500at Brockworth, and these figures seem likely to fall to 3,000 and 1,000respectively by 1960. Men discharged at Coventry may be able to find other employment without difficulty, provided that dismissals are reasonablyspread. Much greater difficulty is expected at Brockworth. However, the firm is versatile and should be able to obtain non-aircraft work and thusreduce the size of the labour problem.Alvis (Coventry)This company manufacture aero-engines on a small scale and are also likely to disappear from the field during the next five years. About 1,000men will be involved.A, V. Roe (Manchester)As a result of the cancellation of the supersonic bomber, A. V. Roe arelikely to lose about two-thirds of their design staff of 980 in the next twoyears. By the end of 1960, with Vulcan production coming to a close, thelabour force required for Ministry of Supply contracts will have fallen fromthe present 10,000 to some 2,000. The company will, on current contracts and prospects alone, be virtually out of business by 1961. They are a particularly well-equipped organisation, and their disappearance would bea major loss. The principal unit at Chadderton (1-4 million square feet)is owned by the Ministry of Supply and could be adapted for heavy engineeringwork.Handley Page (London area) /As Victor production runs out at about the same time as the Vulcan,this firm will be in the same position as A. V. Roe. Their present labour force on Ministry of Supply contracts is about 5,800. Their current private ventureaircraft, the Herald (which is built at Reading) does not promise great success.Faireys (Hayes, Heston and Manchester)Faireys now have no major long-term project apart from the Rotodynehelicopter which has still to prove itself a success in civil markets. The firmemploy about 4,500 at Hayes and Heston, Middlesex and about 2,200 in the manchester area. By the end of 1959, the labour force may at worst be downto 500, and the firm would disappear altogether from the aircraft field. their labour could, over a period, be absorbed elsewhere. Their guided weaponsdevelopment work has been reduced to half what it was last year, and theteam engaged on it is being allowed to run down by natural wastage.Saunders Roe (Cowes, Isle of Wight and Eastleigh)Unless the P. 177 rocket interceptor fighter is continued, this Company,who now employ about 4,400 people on aircraft work, will have to close, orsubstantially contract in size, and considerable, labour difficulties in the Isle of wight will arise.
Armstrong Whitworth (Coventry)This Company are, along with Gloster, Armstrong Siddeley and A.V. Roemembers of the Hawker-Siddeley Group. They are regarded as one of themost efficient aircraft manufacturers in the industry, and their equipment isabove average. They have a guided weapon project (Sea Slug) for naval use.Their only major future project is a private venture civil freighter. Itsprospects are doubtful and, on a pessimistic view, Armstrong Whitworth&apos;present labour force of nearly 8,000 may have declined by 4,000 or more by theend of 1960.Difficulties seem also likely to arise for the following firms:  Air Service Training (Hamble)     ... Aircraft labour 1,600Blackburns (Dumbarton)   ...... Aircraft labour 800Scottish Aviation (Prestwick)       ... Aircraft labour 2,400Napier (London and Liverpool)    ... Aero engine labour 6,000Short and Harland (Belfast)         ... Aircraft labour 8,927(The future of this Company is assured for the next few years, butby 1960 will be in jeopardy unless further substantial Britannia orders have been received by the Bristol Aeroplane Company, with whom theyare affiliated. The firm are likely to lose half of their present design staffof 625 in the next two years unless a new project is placed with them.)4. If the estimates given above for probable reductions in design staffs areaggregated, it is found that out of the total at present employed by five aircraft and aero-engine firms of 3,285, nearly 1,900 are expected to be released within thenext two or three years from work on defence projects, unless new requirementsemerge. Many of these people will be aeronautical specialists of one kind or another, and may not find it easy to obtain suitable employment except in their basic trade. To some extent, of course, they may be absorbed by other firms on civil aircraft work, though the opportunities, certainly in the short term, are limited. It is not unlikely, therefore, that the loss of highly-skilled personnel byemigration from the United Kingdom, which has already given some cause for concern, will increase.5. Total employment in the aircraft industry stood at 266,000 at the endof 1956. It is believed that the overall effect of the cuts will be to reduce thenumbers employed by some 100,000 during the next four or five years, i.e., to thelevel of about 150,000 at which it stood before the war in Korea. Thereafter, thevolume of military aircraft production will be very low, and the industry willhave to sustain itself principally on civil work and exports. About one-half ofthe current exports are military types, but the market will contract if other countriesfollow the lead given by the United Kingdom towards reliance on guided weapons.The total amount of factory space that might be released will approach20 million square feet. Provided the general level of industrial activity remainshigh, some of this floor space would no doubt eventually be transferred to other work, but some buildings used in aircraft manufacture are not attractive for other purposes, witness the difficulties experienced in disposing of the Blackpool factory.The Royal Ordnance Factories6. The total labour likely to be released over the next two years is of theorder of 11,000 of whom some 200 or 300 would be technologists. Thereabsorption of this number by the civil economy should present no difficulty. Sofar as the industrial workers are concerned, the prospects of re-employmentgenerally seem to be fairly good, but there are bound to be some local difficultiesparticularly in relation to factories that were deliberately sited in areas of under-employment, or in rural areas because of explosives risks.7. Other manufacturers of munitions. With a few exceptions the firms engaged on munitions contracts have extensive commercial activities and have so far been able in most cases to absorb redundancies themselves. In the field ofweapon production reduction of requirements for the Aden 30-mm. gun hasresulted in the closure of a production line at Birmingham Small Arms Limited,Dowlais, South Wales. About 300 workpeople are likely to be redundant, butlocal Ministry of Labour officers do not expect difficulty in finding them alternative employment. In the ammunition field, most firms had six to nine months&apos; notice
of impending reductions, and transfers from military to civil work have already taken place, in most cases painlessly. There are, however, one or two exceptions^For example, Currans (Cardiff) have been employed on cartridge case manufacturefor the last twenty years, and have tended to concentrate on this to the exclusion of civil work. Redundancies are likely to occur here, including perhaps fiftyhighly-skilled technologists and workpeople who may find some difficulty inobtaining alternative employment in the area.Explosives, Propellants and Chemicals. The only substantial redundancylikely to occur is at the Ministry of Supply agency factory, operated by imperial chemical Industries at Powfoot near Dumfries (propellant manufacture) where thetotal labour force of 550 will have to be reduced by 200 this year. Some of these willbe absorbed into other parts of the Imperial Chemical Industries organisation, andthe remainder should have no difficulty in obtaining alternative employment.Vehicles. It is difficult to assess how many workpeople will be affected by the reductions in defence orders because of civilian work being carried on in thesame factories and the extensive use of sub-contracting. It may be of the orderof 10,000, but this of course represents only a small proportion of the total number employed in the industry, which is now recovering from the setbacks experienced in 1956, and there should be no difficulty in absorbing the redundancies caused bythe reduction in defence requirements.conclusions. (a) The effects on industry of the decisions announced in the Defence white paper will emerge only gradually. To date they have been negligible.(b) The industries that will be most affected are the aircraft industry and theRoyal Ordnance Factories.(c) So far as production labour is concerned, difficulties of redeploymentwill be encountered here and there, but on the whole no major problem ofreabsorption seems likely to arise.(d) Some of the technical staffs released from defence work will be readilyabsorbed by the civil economy, but others, especially aircraft and aero-enginespecialists, will find the opportunities for the employment of their particular skillsin this country are very limited, and the emigration of highly skilled personnelmay increase.A.
