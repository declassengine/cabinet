Printed for the Cabinet.   August 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 18723rd August, 1957CABINETMEETING OF COMMONWEALTH FINANCE MINISTERS ANDANGLO-CANADIAN TRADE TALKSNote by the Joint Permanent Secretary to the treasury annex to this note (a) A memorandum circulated by the Canadian Government for discussion at the meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers which is to be heldat Mont Tremblant (Annex A);(b) a draft brief on the trade talks which was prepared by officials before wehad the Canadian memorandum and which sets out the lines on whichwe might try to develop discussion: this was designed as a covering note to more detailed briefs still in the course of preparation (Annex B).2. I have discussed these papers with the other senior officials concerned. Thequestions which Ministers will need to consider in the light of these two papersare (i) Does the Canadian memorandum provide sufficient material to form a basis for a Commonwealth Economic Conference in 1958?(ii) What proposals should the United Kingdom make to the Canadians aboutdevelopment of United Kingdom/Canada trade?The Canadian memorandum3. We have only been able to give this memorandum a brief examination.It is little more than a list of the topics known to have some appeal to variousCommonwealth countries (e.g., the price of gold (South Africa) and Conferencefreight rates (Australia)). The memorandum says that the Canadians do not expectall the points to be fully discussed at Mont Tremblant.4. Officials are preparing detailed briefs on all the matters raised in thememorandum. At first sight it does not appear to provide a satisfactory basis fora Commonwealth Economic Conference, and the dangers of a Conference withouta secure basis are obvious. Experience has shown that lack of results in other fields will lead to pressure on the United Kingdom (and perhaps Canada) forfurther development finance.5. On the other hand we must try to ensure that the Canadian Prime Minister,Mr. Diefenbaker, does not appear to receive a major rebuff. Moreover, therewould be some advantage in terms of the negotiations for a free trade area inEurope if the United Kingdom had under examination policies which might appearto provide some alternative course. It should be borne in mind, however, that, ifthe European Free Trade Area negotiations are completed next spring, a commonwealth Economic Conference might in any case be desirable shortly afterwards to examine the implications of the new European trade arrangements,and consequently that commitments as to the agenda or the timing of a conference are better avoided for as long as possible.6. In these circumstances, it would be preferable not to decide finally how to handle the Canadian proposal for an Economic Conference until the reactions ofother Commonwealth Governments have been disclosed at Mont Tremblant. One52117B
alternative might be for the meeting to conclude that the wide range of matters inthe Canadian memorandum required consideration, and to remit them to officialsfor examination. A convenient forum for such examination might be the meetingof senior officials from Commonwealth capitals in the spring of 1958, which is recommended in paragraph 12 of Annex B. (Material might have to be prepared at a previous meeting at a lower level.) These senior officials would then adviseMinisters whether the material was suitable for a Commonwealth EconomicConference, or whether it was better kept to be looked at again at the next meetingof Commonwealth Finance Ministers. The second alternative might be for themeeting to accept in principle the need for an Economic Conference but, recognising that such a Conference would need to be a success, direct officials to examine thematerial for it and report back to Ministers who would then review their decision in the light of that report. In this case too the report might be made by theproposed meeting of senior Commonwealth officials in the spring of 1958.7.   Ministers are invited to agree therefore (i) that at first sight the Canadian memorandum does not provide adequatematerial for a successful Commonwealth Economic Conference;(ii) that the tactics for handling this proposal should be determined in the lightof Commonwealth reactions at Mont Tremblant;(iii) that the Chancellor^ reply to the Canadian Finance Ministers message should refrain from expressing the United Kingdom&apos;s doubts aboutthe adequacy of the material, but that our High Commissioner shouldbe instructed to let these doubts be known at a suitable official level in ottawa.The draft brief by United Kingdom officials8. This brief was prepared before we had seen the Canadian memorandum.It concludes, for the reasons given in paragraphs 5-9, that there is little scope for new initiatives or changes of substance in the field of Commonwealth trade relations.It recommends that a new piece of machinery should be introduced, namely a regular annual meeting of Commonwealth officials at a high level to revieweconomic matters. It is suggested that this proposal should be made at MontTremblant.9. Since Mr. Diefenbaker&apos;s hopes of securing definite agreement to a commonwealth Economic Conference may be disappointed, he may be the moreanxious to bring off an agreement for the expansion of trade between Canada andthe United Kingdom. The draft brief discusses the possibilities. It is clear that,much as we should welcome it as a means of achieving a major policy objective,namely a substantial increase in United Kingdom exports to Canada, there is little prospect of the 15 per cent, switch of Canadian imports from the United States tothe United Kingdom, of which Mr. Diefenbaker has spoken-or of anything likeit being made in the ordinary course of events. Certainly none of the reductions in the Canadian tariff which appear immediately practicable would bring aboutsuch a switch, nor does it seem likely that the Canadians would discriminate againstthe United States to the extent and in the manner necessary to force such a switch.10. It appears that the only way in which&apos; such a diversion could be effectedwithin a reasonable time would be for the United Kingdom and Canada to form a free trade area. Remote though the prospect is that the Canadian Governmentwould agree to dismantle all tariff protection against the United Kingdom, a free trade area would undoubtedly be to the United Kingdom&apos;s advantage. At the lowest, if the European Free Trade Area comes into being it might be useful to beable to say that we had put this idea to the Canadians. There is thus a good deal to be said for advancing this proposition. The argument might run somewhat asfollows:  Great hopes have been aroused by Mr. Diefenbaker&apos;s proposal for a 15 percent, switch/ This has been taken very seriously in the United Kingdom.How do the Canadians propose to bring it about? We assume that theywould not be willing to force the switch by open discrimination against theUnited States. Although increases in preferences and a &quot; Buy British&quot;campaign would be valuable and welcome, these would not do the trick. Butthe creation of a free trade area between the United Kingdom and Canadamight: have the Canadians considered this?
11. If, as is to be feared, the Canadians reject the idea of a free trade area,it might then be possible to advance the suggestions in paragraph 30(i) and (hi) of annex B as an alternative way of bringing the United Kingdom and Canada closer together. A further increase in our dollar indebtedness is not particularly desirable,but to obtain reinforcement of the reserves and a Canadian undertaking to do all they could to adjust tariff preferences in our favour, in return for the removal of discrimination which we foresee as inevitable in the not very distant future, wouldnot be a bad bargain. If the Canadians were willing to hold a proportion of their reserves in sterling (without an exchange guarantee) this would be a reallysignificant demonstration of Commonwealth solidarity and the Canadian confidence in sterling, and would be of great benefit to us.12. It must be recognised, however, that such a step would be far in advanceof Canadian thinking as revealed by the Canadian memorandum and the soundingstaken by the United Kingdom High Commissioner. The Canadians are quiteevidently preoccupied with the ending of quantitative restrictions against canada and their references to the future of convertibility are no doubt largely based ontheir interest in the removal of discrimination. Canadian official advice is likely tobe adverse and the only prospect of securing such an arrangement would be if mr. Diefenbaker were persuaded to make it for major political reasons.13.   Ministers are invited to consider:  (i) whether they wish to propose a United Kingdom/Canada free trade areaalong the lines set out in paragraphs 9 and 10 above;(ii) if not, or if the Canadians reject the idea of a free trade area, whetherMinisters wish to advance the financial proposal in paragraph 30(i) and(iii) of Annex B.14. In either case, questions of tactics and procedure arise. We could not expect such far reaching proposals to be accepted in the course of one or two days&apos;trade discussions immediately after the Commonwealth Finance Ministers&apos; meeting,unless the Canadian Government had had previous warning of them: probably not even then. Moreover, there might be advantage in some discussion with the canadians before the Commonwealth meeting. If anything came of the UnitedKingdom/Canada discussions and an announcement were made at the end, other commonwealth Finance Ministers would be surprised that nothing had been saidto them. Prior warning could be given either in a written message from the PrimeMinister to Mr. Diefenbaker, or orally by the United Kingdom High Commissionersupported by a senior United Kingdom official.15. Alternatively, the matter could be left until Ministers met, perhapsinitially in Washington, or at Mont Tremblant. It would have to be followed up with Mr. Diefenbaker personally and for this purpose the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President of the Board of Trade might go to Ottawa after theFinance Ministers&apos; meeting is over.16.   Ministers will wish to decide between these alternatives.(Signed) ROGER MAKINS.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1.23rd August, 1957.ANNEX a canadian Memorandum for Discussion by Commonwealth Finance ministers the Canadian Government desires to increase two-way trade between commonwealth countries and, in this and other ways, to extend and enlarge thebenefits that the Commonwealth association can bring to its members. accordingly the Canadian Government believes that representatives of commonwealth governments after making adequate preparations should undertake discussion ofa number of questions relating to trade and economic relations between them.52117 &quot; b 2
There have been many important developments and changes in recent years thatmake such discussions appropriate and timely.2. Canada believes that there are opportunities for the expansion of commonwealth trade in the next few years, to take advantage of increasedproductive power and resources and to meet demands in expanding markets in countries of the Commonwealth. We think that positive efforts are required to seethat advantage is taken of these opportunities and that suitable arrangements and institutions are available to facilitate that trade and other mutually beneficialeconomic relations.3. The Canadian Government believes that the expansion of commonwealth trade is consistent in general with the maintenance and improvement of trade between Commonwealth countries and other countries. The proposals in thismemorandum are, we believe, consistent with the obligations which commonwealth countries have assumed to others.4. To begin with matters of trade and payments, there are two general objectives which Canada seeks. The most important of these is the progressiveremoval of quantitative restrictions on trade. In this process we would like to seepriority given to restrictions which impede trade between Commonwealth countries,including Canada. We recognise that some Commonwealth countries, due to the stage and pace of their economic development, are from time to time in balance ofpayments difficulties to such an extent as to make restrictions necessary, but we hope that these can be regarded as individual exceptions.5.   Second, we hope that the United Kingdom will be able to continue the substantial progress already made toward full convertibility.6. The Canadian Government would welcome discussion of the means of developing the sort of environment in which Commonwealth countries would feel able to take further steps in the direction of these major objectives. Some of thefollowing paragraphs bear on these matters.7. It is evident that the creation of the European Common Market, and theproposed association of a Free Trade Area with it, would constitute a change ofthe first magnitude in the field of trade for members of the Commonwealth. ThePrime Ministers have recently discussed the general policy aspects of this change,and our officials have explored together some of the more detailed implications.It has been agreed that more discussions on these matters will be necessary bothamong ourselves and in other groups, such as the Contracting Parties to theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. We believe that a special duty liesupon the Commonwealth to ensure that these European arrangements are&quot; outward looking,&quot; that this great initiative creates better opportunities for alland does not lead to the formation of restrictive trading blocs. All commonwealth countries have a special interest in the European plans in respect of trade in agricultural products. We believe that Ministers should discuss these mattersfurther at the September meeting in an effort to ensure that the Commonwealth asa whole may be adversely affected as little as possible and may benefit to themaximum possible extent from the opportunities afforded by these major changesin Europe.8. The United States has become a dominant influence upon the trade of thewhole free world and all of us are greatly affected by its policies and prosperity.We recognise that the United States has participated constructively in the pasttwenty-five years in the reduction of trade barriers thus making it possible for all of us to increase our trade with it, to the benefit of all concerned. On the otherhand, from time to time United States policies give rise to important questions of concern to several if not all members of the Commonwealth and we consider therewould be merit in seeking an understanding of one another&apos;s points of view inregard to them. The Canadian Government suggests, therefore, that we should review together the various ways in which our countries are affected by the developments of United States commercial policy, including actions taken under &quot;the Trade Agreements Acts, surplus disposal operations and other policies and programmes of the United States bearing upon trade. We have in mind that canada, and no doubt other Commonwealth countries too, will be holdingdiscussions with the United States on a number of trade problems and it wouldbe helpful to each of us to know in advance the views of fellow members of theCommonwealth.
9. The Canadian Government is not now proposing a new system of tariff preferences, or of restrictions against trade with non-Commonwealth countries.On the other hand, if fellow members of the Commonwealth could reciprocate,and if it seems that Commonwealth trade could be promoted on a mutuallyadvantageous basis, we would be glad to engage in discussions relating to tariffadjustments.10. We have already in Canada a Dollar-Sterling Export Board, composedof public-spirited citizens and engaged in promoting imports to Canada from theUnited Kingdom. As part of a concerted programme for increasingCommonwealth trade, it might well be encouraged to intensify its work and broadenits scope in order to cover imports from other Commonwealth countries as wellas the United Kingdom.11. A direct way in which some increase in Commonwealth trade might bebrought about would be through an effort on the part of each commonwealth government, and its agencies, to ensure that, when tenders are called for, suppliersfrom other Commonwealth countries are given every opportunity to put in theirbids. For its part, the Canadian Government would be prepared to review itssystem of procurement, of both military and civilian supplies, with this in mind,subject, of course, to strategic and similar considerations.12. There are a number of special problems of commercial policy we shouldalso like to discuss within the wider context. Four of these may be mentioned;first of all, wheat. The Canadian Government is determined to keep open normal commercial markets for Canadian wheat. It is prepared to retain substantial wheatstocks against needs arising from fluctuations in crops in North America and elsewhere. It has no intention of becoming a weak seller in the wheat markets of the world. Nevertheless, it is prepared to give consideration to the use of a portion of its present wheat surplus to enlarge the scale of assistance now beingmade available to Commonwealth countries under the Colombo Plan.13. Second, it seems clear that Canada, like most major producers, must make some special provision in regard to the major dairy products. This willlikely involve in the future, as in the past, restrictions upon imports at least fromtime to time. We should like to be able to make arrangements with other commonwealth countries that would under such circumstances assure them of an equitable share of imports required to supplement our domestic production in these fields.14. Third, there is a danger that the United States, by imposing new duties on lead and zinc, will be withdrawing a major benefit provided to Canada and australia under our Trade Agreements. In that event, we would be entitled totake steps to preserve the balance of advantages under the Agreements and weshould like to discuss our compensating arrangements with fellow members of theCommonwealth, some of whom may be particularly interested, before reaching decisions as to what we should do.15. Fourth, as long as quantitative restrictions on trade remain, Canada hasa number of special export problems in the field of food products which we believecan be met in considerable part by the resumption of traditional sales to the UnitedKingdom, which need not involve it in any major changes in policy nor any largeexpenditures in dollars. This we shall wish to discuss with the United kingdom in the context of an approach to Commonwealth trade as a whole.16. In addition to questions of trade, there are other matters upon which weare conscious of the need for an exchange of views. Amongst these perhaps themost important are investment and development. These subjects were broadlyreviewed last month at the meeting of Prime Ministers. There may, however, beparticular subjects for further discussion. As for Canada, we warmly welcome the flow of commercial investment that is moving to Canada from the UnitedKingdom and, for our part, we place no restriction on the access of Commonwealthor other countries to our capital market.17. Canada and other Commonwealth countries have participated activelyin the Colombo Plan. The Canadian Government regards that plan as an example of the constructive way in which the Commonwealth spirit can be translated into effective action. The plan has not been exclusive, and others outside theCommonwealth have become associated with it.   We would, however, welcome an
opportunity to discuss certain questions, at least in a preliminary way, within theCommonwealth family; for example, whether the forms and types of aid that havebsen supplied are best serving the fundamental purposes of the plan. Nor shoulddiscussion of these and similar matters be confined to the area covered by the colombo Plan; there are now other countries, emerging from the status of colonies,that may well engage our special attention.18. Several Commonwealth countries are amongst the world&apos;s largestproducers of gold. The Canadian Government is naturally interested in anyproposal affecting its price. Following the meetings of the International monetary fund, it would seem appropriate to review this matter together.19. We in Canada expect to proceed on a large scale with the productionand export of uranium for peaceful purposes. We wish to export uranium forthese purposes on a commercial basis, subject to effective safeguards to ensure thatfissionable products made from it are not diverted to military use. We hope othermembers of the Commonwealth will agree with the desirability of building uptrade on such a basis in order that this great new source of energy may be mostfruitfully used for the benefit of mankind without endangering the security of all of us. We should like to have an opportunity of discussing with our partners inthe Commonwealth this aspect of the trade in uranium and other materials andequipment for producing atomic energy.20. In addition it might be useful to exchange information on our programme in the field of atomic energy and to discuss the inter-relation of trade policies andthe development of manufacturing industries in this general field.21. The Canadian Government would also like to review a number of matters under the broad heading of Communication and Transportation between members of the Commonwealth. There are, for instance, suggestions for a comprehensive modernisation of the cable and telephone communications between all Commonwealth countries. Experience with the new co-axial cable across the atlantic seems to suggest that improved facilities give rise to greatly increasedtraffic.22. There is an important shipping matter affecting trade which gives Canadaconcern. The levels of freight rates on trade between Canada and some othercountries of the Commonwealth are so high as to handicap the effectivedevelopment of direct trade between our countries in competition with other trade.While these are private or conference rates, they are of sufficient importance to warrant discussion between Governments to see what can be done to ensure thatsuch rates do not divert trade from Commonwealth to other channels.23. Turning to the matter of personal travel, the Canadian Governmentwarmly welcomes the recent decision of the United Kingdom to provide a travel allowance ( 100 per annum) to tourists visiting Canada and also the increases which have been made in travel allowances by Australia and New Zealand. Weare examining a request by the United Kingdom that the Canadian tariff shouldbe adjusted so as to facilitate tourist purchases by Canadians who visit overseas countries. We would be glad to review with other members of the commonwealth the possibility of giving encouragement to travel between our countries.24. Finally, Canada has a number of tax treaties with other members of theCommonwealth and the Canadian authorities are aware that many efforts havebeen made to remove or reduce the tax barriers to persons in commonwealth countries investing in other Commonwealth countries. We consider, however, itmight be worthwhile to make a survey in this field to ensure that all is being donethat can properly be done to avoid double taxation and to facilitate the flow of productive private investment between the countries of the Commonwealth while at the same time securing an equitable division of revenue on the basis ofrecognised principles.
ANNEX draft Brief on Anglo-Canadian Trade TalksIntroductoryThis note deals with item 3 of the Agenda for the Commonwealth finance ministers&apos; talks (Trade) and the bilateral trade talks with the Canadians; therewill be separate briefs dealing with items 1 and 2 of the Agenda for theCommonwealth Finance Ministers&apos; Conference. It summarises a number of briefswhich are still being prepared by officials for the use of Ministers in Ottawa.Although the expansion of trade is the principal subject, payments questions and matters of investment and consultation inevitably enter in.2. Mr. Diefenbaker&apos;s proposals have been publicly expressed both as a wishto expand Commonwealth trade and, more precisely, a suggestion that Canadamight aim to switch 15 per cent, of her imports from the United States to theUnited Kingdom. It will therefore be necessary for Ministers to deal with theseproposals separately in terms both of what arrangements may be possible betweenthe whole Commonwealth and what arrangements may be possible between theUnited Kingdom and Canada. Accordingly the remainder of this note falls into two parts.3. It will be seen from paragraphs 5-9 below that there is little prospect of launching any major Commonwealth trade project. If, unexpectedly, anythingemerges during the discussions it would be advantageous in terms of our negotiations in Europe to keep it alive and under examination. It might have a salutary effect on our European partners if they thought that we had in prospecta new Commonwealth trade policy as well as a European trade policy. But weshould not attach too much importance to this point; it would not in our view be useful to set up continuing discussions on a Commonwealth trade policy if therewere no substance behind the proposals under examination (though we dorecommend in paragraph 12 below new arrangements for regular consultation between senior officials of Commonwealth countries). On the other hand, it mustbe recognised that if we failed to secure a European Free Trade Area some ofthe problems of expanding Commonwealth trade might look different. It is,however, too early to judge what kind of external commercial and financial policy we should wish to pursue if the European Free Trade Area negotiations broke down.4. It seems that what we should aim at securing from the talks in canada is:  (a) improved arrangements for consultation with the Commonwealth;(b) the maximum steps we can persuade the Canadian Government to take to improve our trading and payments arrangements with Canada inreturn for whatever concessions on our side would be appropriate.If, as seems likely, no major Commonwealth trade prospect emerges, it will be important to ensure that Mr. Diefenbaker appears to receive as small a rebuff aspossible in this connection, in order that he should not be discouraged in pursuit of an improvement in United Kingdom-Canadian trade, and in order to furtherour general relations with Canada.The Whole CommonwealthIncreased trade. We do not know whether Mr. Diefenbaker will propose another &quot; ottawa conference &quot; and it is doubtful whether he would command wide support in theCommonwealth if he did so. In the past, Australia and New Zealand have beenthe strongest supporters of Imperial Preference but in our trade negotiations lastyear with Australia the question was how far we could maintain existingpreferences.6. Inter-governmental arrangements for expanding Commonwealth trade would involve, on our side, strengthening the protection given in our market to
Commonwealth food and raw materials; on the side of the rest of theCommonwealth it would involve larger margins of preference for United kingdom goods.7. Discrimination in favour of Commonwealth countries has generally been by means of tariff preferences; it could also be achieved by the use of quotasor by bulk purchase. But these courses would cut across our existing commercial policy and our international obligations. All of them would raise practicaldifficulties:  (a) Both the United Kingdom and the rest of the Commonwealth would thereby injure the trade of foreign countries and have to face retaliation.(b) Increased discrimination in favour of the Commonwealth would be certain to raise a political outcry in the United States.(c) Europe could not be expected to tolerate a free trade area in manufacturesaccompanied by increased preference for Commonwealth foodstuffs.8. There remains the danger of a split in the Commonwealth because nothingsuggests that the Asian members would back increased preference and South Africahas always been lukewarm about giving us worthwhile preferences. NoCommonwealth country would lightly reject an offer of increased preference inthe United Kingdom market but most seem unlikely to be prepared to give usmuch in return.9t It is in any event improbable that the Commonwealth would be preparedto enter into new preferential trading arrangements unless the United kingdom was prepared to limit her domestic agricultural support. It is the high level ofour own agricultural production which, more than any other single factor, hasharmed Commonwealth trade in foodstuffs with the United Kingdom, and theextent to which this is based on price support has alarmed the Commonwealth.In pressing us to enter into some limitation of our agricultural support theCommonwealth would be united and indeed would be urging on us the samecourse that Europe will urge on us in the coming months during the free trade area negotiations. If some such course were regarded as politically tolerableit might be possible to secure Commonwealth trading arrangements which would help our export trade substantially. But we have not explored these possibilitiesfurther in this memorandum.10. [Paragraph to be inserted later on Colonial aspects and on scope forincreased exports to Canada from the rest of the sterling Commonwealth.]I Investment11. New organisational or institutional arrangements will not produce new capital. Given our need for heavy investment at home it must be very doubtfulwhether we can increase our investment in the Commonwealth for a long time tocome. We must concentrate on a more limited objective to continue doing asi much for the Commonwealth as we have done in the past. There is no prospecthere of building new and attractive Commonwealth arrangements.Consultation12.   Close working relations between senior officials from capitals isi invaluable  Over the next few years, when the sterling Commonwealth will be running down their balances as their development programmes get under way, itwill be very important to keep in close touch.   Moreover, if close consultation isto be developed with Europe in the context of the free trade area it willbe important, though more difficult because of the distances, to develop it in theI Commonwealth as well.   There is an opportunity each year for senior officials ofthe Commonwealth to meet at the time when Commonwealth Finance Ministers. meet at the Bank/Fund Meeting.  But it would be useful to propose a springmeeting of officials as well for a general exchange of views on economic trendsand enable officials to form a balanced picture against which to advise their ministers over the following months.   Normally officials concerned with overseasfinance would attend such a meeting but it would be natural to discuss topics of major current interest (such as the European Free Trade Area at present) and&apos; officials from Departments appropriate for each occasion would in practice attend.
United Kingdom CanadaTrade13. The balance of trade is already heavily in favour of Canada and it istherefore reasonable that Mr. Diefenbaker&apos;s proposal for a switch of 15 per cent, oftheir purchases from the United States to the United Kingdom should involve action by Canada not fully compensated by action by us to ease Canada&apos;s trade. On theother hand, Canada&apos;s market is more freely open to our exports than our market isto Canada because of the quantitative restrictions which we still use and Canadawill no doubt expect some action on our side as well as on hers. But it is important to bear in mind that there is no case for any exactly &quot; balanced &quot; move by both parties.14. In default of a decision by Canada to reverse her whole commercial policy, e.g., by open discrimination against the United States or by ignoring the no-new-Preference rule of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) aswitch of 15 per cent, as suggested by Mr. Diefenbaker is out of the question. Weshould do very well indeed to increase Our exports to Canada by 25 per cent, whichwould involve a switch by Canada from the United States of 3 per cent.15. In the discussions with Canada on United Kingdom-Canada trade, animportant objective on our part would be to secure tariff concessions from Canada.The Canadians, for their part, are likely to concentrate on the reduction by us ofthe quantitative restrictions which frustrates their present tariff advantage in our market, possibly coupled with some assurances about the market for their wheat;they would say that tariff concessions by us (the scope for which is in any caselimited) would be of no use if frustrated by quantitative restrictions. before considering this matter further it is necessary to consider the problem of discriminatory restrictions and payments arrangements.Discriminatory Restrictions and Payments Arrangements16. It would not be possible to justify lifting our restrictions against Canadiantrade whilst retaining them in full against the United States. Not only would this be contrary to our obligations in the International Monetary Fund (I.M.F.) and .A.T.T. but it would be impossible to justify it as a matter of commonsense by pointing to any difference in the payments arrangements between the UnitedKingdom, on the one side, and the United States and Canada, on the other. Wehave considered whether we could create a payments justification for discrimination between Canada and the United States (e.g., by the Canadians agreeing to holdsterling see paragraph 17). But the Americans could argue that, apart fromearlier loans and aid, they have in the past year provided very substantial assistance to our payments both through their support of the I.M.F. drawing andstandby and through the Exim-Bank credit.17. We have already done virtually. all we can without discrimination toremove restrictions particularly damaging to Canada rather than the United States.The problem of any substantial easing of quantitative restrictions in the context of Anglo-Canadian trade arrangements is therefore one of lifting dollardiscrimination in general. The present is not a good time for major advances in this field. Germany is increasingly drawing in gold and dollars from the world, whilethe United States is no longer pushing them out and, just recently at any rate, hasbeen drawing them in. Nevertheless, the present position on dollar discriminationis not tenable as a permanent arrangement and sooner or later the force of domesticpressures to buy dollar goods, such as chemicals and machinery, together with our international obligations will require us to eliminate discrimination against dollar imports. The removal of discrimination will entail some initial strain on the reserves and the discussion of any programme for the removal of discriminationwould provide grounds for exploring the possibility of the Canadians being willingto reinforce the reserves against the transitional risks involved. If the economic discussions with Canada resulted in agreed plans enabling us to accelerate, theremovalof discrimination accompanied by some reinforcement., in the; reserves, itwould be a desirable objective to work for. ,Thus Canada might: -        &apos;,   (a) give us a long term loan of some $400,million (about 20.per.cent, of her present external reserves);52117c
(b) hold a predetermined sum in sterling instead of gold or United Svatesdollars as part of her reserves and agreed not to call on it until the totalreserves had fallen to some stated level;(c) agree to build up her sterling holdings to 25 per cent, of her total reserves and maintain that proportion thereafter.Of these three alternatives, (c) would be the most attractive to us, though it shouldbe borne in mind that the Canadians might well ask for an exchange gu arantee,which we should not be prepared to give because of the pressures by other holders of sterling which it would engender.v. 18. If some such arrangement were made with Canada we should need as a consequence to have separate negotiations with the United States leading to aneasing of quantitative restrictions on imports from them (though not necessarilyto the full extent of the concessions to Canada). We should seek some quid pro quofrom the United States which might take the form of all or any of the following:  (a) Renewal of the I.M.F. standby and Exim Bank credit if these have not previously been renewed.(b) Some modification of the assurance that we would not use the bisquesunder the Anglo-American Loan Agreement in the years immediatelysucceeding the revision made to the Agreement at the beginning of thisyear. This would secure for us a loan for over forty years at the low rate of 2 per cent.(c) Some removal of United States restrictions on imports from the sterling area.Possible Developments in the Trade Field19. There is no means of bringing about a substantial switch in Canadianpurchases from the United States to the United Kingdom at all quickly. Insucceeding paragraphs we examine a series of steps which the Canadians might take to stimulate trade with us and the measures we might take in return:  (a) measures involving no tariff changes.(b) Tariff concessions (on a graduated scale) perhaps combined with anundertaking to hold sterling; the relaxing of quantitative restrictionsby us.(c) A free trade area.No Tariff Changes\ 20. As a first step there are certain measures which the Canadians could take without tariff changes. Much work has already been done by the DollarExport Council and its opposite number in Canada, the Dollar Sterling TradeCouncil. There may be scope for progress through &quot; Buy British &quot; campaigns.But it is necessary to think in terms of creating over a period of up to, say, five orten years the conditions under which a new trend can develop. There may alsobe scope for trade missions from Canada to this country and Mr. James Duncan,Chairman of the Dollar Sterling Trade Council, is believed to have a plan forproposing a mission of Canadian industrialists under the leadership of a canadian minister. We have welcomed this idea. It would be possible for the canadian government to issue directives to secure the shift of central Government purchases arms and civil stores from the United States to the United Kingdom. Sucha directive was issued to Departments by the Canadian Government some yearsago but it has by no means always been carried out. It will therefore be necessaryfor the Canadian Government to be active in following up any directives they mayissue to ensure that they are carried out to the maximum possible extent. TheMinister of Supply will fake this up in the context of arms purchases when he visitsCanada before the Finance Ministers&apos; Conference and it could be emphasised again at the time of the Conference in bilateral discussions with Canada. The canadian government could also in some measure influence the course of purchases byCrown Corporations and by Provincial Governments and municipalities. any assistance which the Canadians are prepared to give us on these lines could resonably be expected to be given in pursuance of their own expressed objective ofdiverting purchases from the United States and without our having to give anything in return.
Tariff Concessions and Holding Sterling21. The &quot; no-new-preference &quot; rule of the G.A.T.T. precludes any increase by canada in the preferential margins which we enjoyed in 1939. Where these marginshave since been narrowed restoration of the 1939 margin would, of course, improve our competitive position. But Canada would have to negotiate with the UnitedStates and other foreign countries interested her freedom to restore the margin toits 1939 size, and this would normally be an expensive operation which we must expect the Canadians to be reluctant to undertake. Our best hope in the tarifffield will, therefore, be to persuade the Canadians to bind the existing position where a binding would be of value to us. Such an outcome would not achieveany diversion of trade from the United States, but would at least help to arrestthe trend in the other direction.  Our concern would be:  (i) to get margins of preference bound on goods where the main competitionto our exporters comes from foreign suppliers. Bindings of the marginwould preclude the Canadians from negotiating with, say, the UnitedStates a reduction in the most-favoured-nation rate (not matched by an equal reduction in the preferential rate) in exchange for some reductionin the United States tariff of value to Canadian exporting industries.(ii) To get preferential rates bound on goods where the main competition toour exporters comes from Canadian industry.22. We might secure from the Canadians anything from a very iimitednumber of concessions, such as would not give rise to any difficulties with theirmanufacturers or exporters, to concessions over a wide range of items including some where the concession would hurt important domestic industries and accordingly would be of real value to us. The probability is, however, that weshould not get far up the scale. For the Canadian Government, which has already given some indication that it may be more responsive than its predecessor topressures from its domestic industries for protection or other assistance, is unlikely to be willing to tie its hands by giving us bindings on goods covering importantsections of industry.23. In the tariff field there is very little that we can do for Canada in returnfor any tariff concessions she might make, since she already enjoys free entry intothe United Kingdom for almost all her goods. We could, however, offer to bindpreference margins in suitable cases subject to a waiver, where necessary, in respectof the European Free Trade Area. If the tariff concessions offered to us wereunimportant it might not be necessary to go beyond this. If, however, the canadians were prepared to negotiate substantial tariff concessions we should, nodoubt, have to offer relaxations to our quantitative restrictions. What we give inthe way of quantitative restrictions relaxations would be a matter of negotiation and would depend on the scale of the tariff concessions oh offer. We should haveto do the best deal we could, bearing in mind the additional cost of imports fromthe United States arising from our non-discrimination obligations. Salmon(canned and fresh), apples and cheese are commodities in which Canada has the major supplying interest and would probably value concessions. The additionaltrade resulting from freeing these items might be worth  2 millions a year to canada on the average. If we had to go further, an increased quota of  1 million for token imports (with an equivalent increase for the United States) might be appropriate. Relaxation of quantitative restrictions on chemicals or machinery would be a more substantial concession and also would be of a greater help to our economy, but imports of these classes of goods would come predominantly fromthe United States.24. In the event of the Canadians offering us really important concessions,whether in the tariff field or by their agreeing to hold a proportion of their reserves in sterling or both, we should have to consider the removal of quantitative restrictions on a large scale. This might lead to an increase in our imports (ratherthan to switches in our source of supply). We must not, however, lose sight ofthe effect on the balance of payments of the other changes in our economy whichwould go with it (e.g., the use to which we could put the resource^ released by the extra imports from production for the home market). The scope&quot;in. this field, thepayments arrangements which would be necessary,; and the consequentialrelaxations in imports from the United States have already been referred:to inparagraphs 16-18. Any such arrangements would no doubt involve us ih^aV^imed52117 d
commitment to remove discrimination over, say, two or three years and this wehave always so far avoided. But the time in which we can continue these restrictions. is obviously drawing towards a close, and it is worth considering atimed commitment to.remove.discrimination in return for some fortification of thergseryes if as would no doubt be the case, we could secure a balance of paymentsescape,,clause fox use if we were using quantitative restrictions on imports from elsewhere. In terms of our long-term economic interests and of commonwealth relations, this course is&apos;perhaps the best of all because it would do so much to eliminate the divergence of ways.in the economic field which has, during and since-the;war, developed between Canada and the rest.of the Commonwealth.25. Commonwealth Sugar. The preference guarantee at present afforded by canada to sugar imported from the Commonwealth is of great value both to theBritish West Indies&apos; economy and to the Sterling Area&apos;s foreign exchange position.It would, therefore, be valuable to secure an undertaking by Canada to maintain this preference for a period. We should probably be expected in return to grantincreased facilities for Canadian (and United States) exports to the British west indies.26. Wheat. As mentioned in paragraph 15 the Canadians may ask forassurances about the market in this country for their wheat. This raises great difficulties for us and there is really little that we can do because our wheat marketis already free and the Canadians are already supplying such substantial quantitiesof wheat to us that they could scarcely ask us to enter into special arrangements totake more. They might, however, wish us to take action against the import ofcompetitive hard wheat which is subsidised (e.g., from the United States) thoughthe evidence is that they are more concerned at present with United States exportsunder aid to other destinations. The various issues will be dealt with fully in thebriefs. .A Free Trade Area27. One way of building up Anglo-Canadian trade and assisting in theswitch proposed by Mr. Diefenbaker would be to set up a free trade area betweenthe United Kingdom and Canada. This would justify open discrimination by canada against the United States though the United States reaction would almost certainly be strong even though the discrimination would be justifiable under I.M.F.and G.A.T.T. A free trade area would be more attractive to us than to Canada.This in itself is not unreasonable given the existing imbalance in trade. But theproposal would present very great difficulties to the Canadians whose growingindustries would lose their tariff protection against our exports. NeverthelessMinisters might float the suggestion in Ottawa as a proposal meriting full examination. We can expect the idea to be rejected because of its difficulties forthe Canadians and Ministers will therefore want to be cautious in choosing theterms in which they put the idea forward. They should also appreciate that overa period it is likely that a free trade area between the United Kingdom and canada and a free trade area in Europe would be likely to merge, even if the canadians did not raise this possibility at the outset; this would have far-reachingimplications for our commercial position and our tariff preferences in Canada(see also paragraph 29 below).28. While we have no tariffs and little quantitative restrictions againstCanada&apos;s agriculture, the Canadians would no doubt wish to &quot; include agriculture &quot;in any free trade area in the sense that they would wish to limit any return to restrictions by us. The suggestion that agriculture should be included in a free trade area with Canada could certainly not be rejected but it raises a number of questions which would need examination, including the impact on our negotiationswith Europe and the impact on the rest of the Commonwealth.29. If the suggestion of a United Kingdom-Canada Free Trade Area is madeto Canada they may rejoin that a free trade area with Europe including theUnited Kingdom might be more attractive for them. The implications of this for us would need very careful examination and we have not been able toundertake this examination in the time. If this idea were put forward by Canadian ministers, our Ministers should treat it very cautiously and limit themselves tosaying that it was a far-reaching proposal; it was by no means clear that the europeans would find it acceptable; the idea would need much further study.
Summary of Trade and Payments Possibilities30.   To: sum up:  (i) The Canadians might take certain steps such as &quot; Buy British &quot; campaigns,fostering trade missions and the issue of directives relating to purchaseson public account. These steps would not warrant anything from usin return (paragraph 20).(ii) They might make tariff concessions.   Modest concessions might be met by modest relaxations by us in the field of quantitative restrictions(paragraphs 22-23).(iii) The Canadians are likely to press for the dismantling of quantitative restrictions on a large scale with perhaps a timed commitment. Inreturn we might get from them a package made up of some mixture of tariff concessions and fortification of the reserves. We should haveto look very carefully at the exact composition of any bargain on theselines which emerged. It would be necessary to negotiate with theUnited States arrangements for relaxing our quantitative restrictions on imports from them (paragraphs 16-18 and 24).(iv) Ministers might float the idea of a free trade area with Canada, though in cautious terms as the difficulties which it would create for the canadians might well lead them to reject it (paragraphs 27-29).Investment31. We have considered the possibilities in this field and have reached thefollowing conclusions:  (a) We are already spending a sum approaching $ 100 millions a year on direct investment in Canada and cannot afford more.(b)If the Canadians were to offer to waive or defer payments on theCanadian loan, various possibilities for greater investment in Canadaor in the Commonwealth would be open for consideration; but wecould not ourselves take the initiative in seeking such an offer.(c) A limited switch from United States to Canadian securities in theExchange Equalisation Account (E.E.A.) might be worth offering,notwithstanding the difficulties.
