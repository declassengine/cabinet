CobTHE ECONOMIC situation memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic and Political DangerMy own thoughts have been moving very much in the samedirection as the Prime Ministers, and I should like to supplement his paper (C.(57) 194) by setting out my own view of the dangers which con-front us and of the steps which we should take to combat them.   I said in a recent paper that &quot;on the basis of existing policies the question wasnot whether we devalued the pound but when&quot;.   Nothing that has happenedsince inclines me to change that view.2.     Loss of confidence in the value of our money, both at home andabroad, continues to be the major threat to our economic interests.Fundamentally, these doubts are based on a disbelief in our willingness to take the steps needed to stop the constant inflation of prices.Scepticism abroad is strengthened by opinion at home and vice versa.Neither the people of this country nor the world outside believe that wepossess the wit or courage to set our house in order.3.     We should be under no illusion as to the nature of the dangers,political and well as economic, which confront us.   I believe that anotherdevaluation, however it might be presented or wrapped up, would spellpolitical disaster.   A continued rapid rise in the cost of living, even ifthere is no devaluation, will have most serious electoral consequences.4.      It is perfectly true that many people feel that they are doing wellout of the inflation, but there is no evidence that we are picking up manyrecruits from the prosperous majority.    What is certain is that a great number of those who are suffering from inflation are just the people whoform the hard core of the Tory Party - the men and women who do the hard slogging work in the constituencies.   My colleagues will know fromtheir own experience how bitterly such people feel about the way thingshave gone.   To enter a difficult electoral battle with the &quot;old guard&quot;disaffected is to risk a smashing defeat.5.      Moreover the problem of sterling has political implications out-side this island.   If we are forced to what could in effect be anotherdevaluation, it is unlikely that most of the other countries of the sterling area wili be willing to maintain the present system.   The Tory Party maylose the next election anyway.   What matters is not whether it loses it butwhy.   If we are thrown out because we are thought to have been too toughin defence of what we conceive to be our national and imperial interests the circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of........................... ,TOP SECRET Copy No. /.....C.(57) 1957th September, 1957CABINET
and have allowed a modest growth in unemployment, we shall be returnedagain, perhaps quite soon.   If we are thrown out because we haveflinched from our duty and allowed our economy to drift into disaster,I see no particular reason why we should ever be asked to resume control.6.      The meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington on24th September will cause intense speculation about exchange rates.   Afew days later we shall be meeting the Finance Ministers of theCommonwealth at Mont Tremblant.   In October we shall be giving an account of our stewardship to the Conservative Party at Brighton.   I donot anticipate that at the Washington talks we shall be altruisticallybailed out by a new German Government.   The Germans in their heartsare not sorry to see the Deutschmark strong and the pound weak.   Iexpect that during and after these talks the most likely thing is a steady increase in the pressure against sterling.   We have no time to wait for something to turn up and our chances of holding the exchange value ofthe pound in the next few months depend on action now.   I proposetherefore before leaving for Washington to state what we propose to doand to stand on the existing sterling exchange rate when I get there.The Growing Inflation7.     Now as to the facts.   They are harsh.   The index of retail prices has risen by 7 per cent since January, 1956.   In the same period the index of weekly wage rates has risen by 11 per cent.   Yet the Trade Unions areactively preparing both new wage claims, and demands for a shorter working week which are thinly disguised wage claims, since they want the same pay for shorter hours, and more overtime.   These will be themore difficult to resist if the present employment position remains unchanged.   Unemployment in July was only about 1. 1 per cent of thelabour force, about the same figure as that of a year ago and only about. 2 per cent above the low point reached in the summer of 1955.   Unfilledvacancies reported to Labour Exchanges now out-number the unemployed in the ratio of 14 to 10.   Although there is a seasonal element in thesefigures, they imply a considerable excess demand for labour.8.      As the unemployment figures show, we are running the economyabove the pressure which it can stand.   The economists may never agreewhether we are suffering from a cost-push or a demand inflation; the essence may well be that we are suffering from both.   Costs are certainlybeing pushed up by inflated wage claims:  and these wage claims arebeing conceded in the expectation that the level of demand will be such asto enable the increased costs and more to be passed on in prices.   At themeeting of the National Production Advisory Council for Industry on26th August, where the problem of inflation was discussed, it was clear tome that although employers and the more responsible Trade union leaders are an anxious about the situation as we are, they feel that itis almost impossible for restraint to be effective when there are too many jobs available and when employers can pass on cost increases soeasily.9.      The effect of an inflation unchecked or checked only intermittentlyover the years has now spread to wider fields.   The lose of domesticconfidence, which began some years ago in the movement from gilt-edgedsecurities to equities, has now reached a point at which it is virtually impossible to fund Government debt.   This means that in spite of all our efforts the floating debt continues at a size which constantly threatensthe monetary system.   Commonwealth countries, including the Colonies,
cannot raise loans on the London market.   The alternative sometimessuggested of what is called Exchequer Finance has come in effect to mean adding once more both to the volume of the floating debt and to the pressure of the inflation.10.   Externally, we have lost $225 millions from the reserves inAugust and we will have to pay $135 millions in September to the european payments Union for our August deficit.   Our total losses from the reserves in September will certainly not be less than our losses inAugust and very likely will be more.   Although most of these losses are due to speculative buying of German currency, this buying is done withsterling because our own prices are expected to go on rising.11.    Whatever we may think of what is happening in ether countries such as Germany, the defence of sterling is our own responsibility;   Itis what we do here in this island which will determine our future.   Itis our domestic situation which is, or could be, under our own control.It is upon our ability to deal with this that we shall certainly be judged.The Supply of Money12.    I have come to the conclusion that the continual increase in wagesand prices rests in the last resort on the belief in the country that theGovernment will always make enough money available to support full,arid indeed over-full, employment, whatever the heights to which wages and prices rise.   Until we show that this cannot be counted on we shall make no progress.   The policy of appeals to employers and unions for restraint,which has been tried for ten years by our predecessors and ourselves, hasbeen shown to be ineffectual under existing conditions of demand.13.    I propose therefore that we should make it clear that theGovernment is no longer willing to underwrite a situation which mustbefore long lead to economic disaster.   The essence of my proposal isthat we take steps - and be seen to take steps - which will limit the levelof money available in the economy and which will hold it at that leveluntil such time as it can with safety be enlarged.   We must do this by cutting back expenditure.   I do not think it right to attempt to take moneyaway from the public by still higher taxation (which some urge upon thebasis that what is wrong is that we consume too much) since this merelyincreases the use of a remedy which is already doing more harm than good to the patient.   What is needed is to make it rather harder to makemoney but rather easier and rather more rewarding to save it.   until we have done this we shall not be able to meet more of the Governmentsneeds by borrowing from the public.14.    The point of this limitation in the money supply by restrainingexpenditure should be clearly understood.   It would mean that if costs and prices rise further in these fields there will not be an elastic supplyof funds to support the increase.   In other words we must not go onfinancing the inflation by simply making more funds available.   Lessactivity will have to be undertaken or fewer people employed.   I havenever held the view that massive large-scale unemployment was a solu-tion to our problems and have explicitly said so.   Nevertheless anunemployment rate of just over 1 per cent is at the other extreme andrepresents the measure of the pressure which we are under.   We mustbe prepared to see the rate rise to around 3 per cent, since unless wecan get away from the idea that over-full employment must be supportedat all costs we have no hope of curing the inflation.
15.    There are nevertheless two sectors of public expenditure withwhich I do not propose to deal in detail in this paper - the current expenditure of the Government and the current expenditure of localauthorities.   The Governments current expenditure is dealt with throughthe Estimates.  As to civil expenditure, the Prime Minister, in his minute M. 405/57 of 10th August, 1957, has asked all Ministers to acceptthe aim of holding total civil expenditure next year within this year&apos;slimit.   Defence expenditure must be held below a firm ceiling of 1,450 millions next year, and the necessary decisions of policy must betaken to ensure that it is further reduced thereafter.   The investment expenditure of local authorities is covered by the proposals I makebelow.   Their other expenditure continues to grow, and represents an increasing threat to the general economic situation.   I am sure that mycolleagues who are concerned with Local Government expenditure will do all they can to restrict it; but an important reinforcement to our generalpolicy will soon be available in the shape of the general grant which willprovide the local authorities with a greater incentive to restrain theirown expenditure.16.   Nevertheless, a policy of cutting the amount of money availablein the system by retrenchment in expenditure, if it is to be effective and indeed i  it is to be acceptable, must be applied in both the public and private sectors.   Inevitably the greater part of what we are able to do in thepublic sector must necessarily be in the field of public investment, whetherby Government, the nationalised industries or other authorities.   I dealwith the flow of money into public sector investment and to the private sector successively in what follows.Public Sector Investment17.    The present estimates are set out in the Annex.   They are vastnow and unless a limit is placed upon them they will rapidly becomevaster still. The plain truth is that we cannot re-equip our basic industries, build schools, hospitals and roads, and clear the slums all atthe same time and at the present pace, let alone a growing pace.18.    I propose that we take immediate steps designed to keep theaggregate expenditure on investment by public authorities - centralGovernment, local authorities and nationalised industries - in the years1958/59 and 1959/60 within a money limit of  1,500 millions in eachyear.   This figure of  1,500 millions is likely to approximate to theactual expenditure in 1957/58, so that we would be aiming, broadly speaking,at maintaining expenditure on public investment in 1958/59 and 1959/60 atthe high level to which it is expected to rise in 1957/58.   (The estimatein the Annex -  1,450 millions - is at 1956 prices.   The figure of 1,500 millions makes some allowance for price increases since then.)19.   In order to keep expenditure in 1958/59 and 1959/60 within amoney limit of  1,500 millions in each year we shall have to adjust the programmes of public investment in 1958/59 and 1959/60 implied in the annex (i. e. at 1956 prices) by about 10 per cent, that is, about  320millions off the total of  3,170 millions over the two years.   The divisionof this amount between the two years might be  120 millions in 1958/59and  200 millions in 1959/60, to allow for the fact that more of theexpenditure in 1958/59 is already firmly committed.   This will involvemodification of programmes and policies which have already been announced.   I hope it will be possible to avoid contract cancellations and similar dislocation, but if necessary this will have to be faced. -
20.    On the other hand, I hope that when we have made these adjust-ments to the various programmes for 1958/59 and 1959/60 we shall beable thereafter to leave them undisturbed.   I am well aware of thefrustration and inefficiency which may result from repeated Governmentalattempts to make short-term changes.   When we have carried out thisadjustment for the next two years, I would propose that we conduct a review of our long-term commitments for investment by public authorities,and do the necessary re-phasing to ensure that the future load does not out-run the prospective supply of savings available for these purposes.21.    In this process of short-term and long-term adjustment, we musthold the balance fairly between investment in basic industries and services (upon which the nation&apos;s future industrial activity and growthdepend) and housing and other social service investment.   But I must make it clear that a big cut in public housing, put into effect at once, isinescapable.   We cannot have the power stations, the houses and the schools; we have got to choose.22.    I am having preliminary proposals worked out now for discussions between officials of the Treasury and of the appropriate Departments.Pending a Cabinet decision on these detailed proposals, Ministers shouldslow down as much as possible authorisations of capital expenditure by their Departments and the appropriate Ministers should ask the nationalised bodies to do likewise.   This will reduce the need for cancellation-tions.   It is essential that so far as possible we should stop a proportionof the orders that would be placed during the remainder of this year.Fewer starts sanctioned now will mean less heavy pressure on the economy in twelve months1 time.   I hope my colleagues will therefore agree thatin the meantime Ministers should be instructed to slow down authorisation-tions for capital expenditure by the Departments and the nationalisedbodies.23.    If we are going to cut down the level of public housing, I thinkthat we shall have to consider reintroducing building control.   Not thatI believe that much luxury construction would be going on, but becauseat a time of severe capital shortage and within a few months of the passingof the Rent Act, it would be extremely difficult to justify politically a situation in which the building of houses by local authorities was beingseverely cut back while nothing at all was being done to take parallelaction to restrict the building of office blocks, shops, petrol stations,etc.   It might even be argued, however illogically, that action oughtalso to be taken to control private house-building.   Whether we made animmediate announcement of this would be a different matter, which weshould have to consider.   It would inevitably take some time to prepare a workable scheme of control and it would be a mistake to allow too longa gap between the announcement and the introduction of the new scheme,since otherwise there would be a good deal of scope for forestalling.The Private Sector24.    If we can achieve the objective proposed above in relation   to public investment, this will put us in a better position than we have beenhitherto to expect acceptance of stronger measures to control the funds available to the private sector.   If we take no action we must expect that,apart from seasonal fluctuation, bank advances will show a fairly steady increase.   We must, I suggest, take action to reverse this trend.   Such a restriction of credit as would flow from a reduction in the level of bank
advances would further limit the use of bank overdrafts for capitalexpenditure - a particularly inflationary type of finance.   The aim shouldbe, in my view, to secure a reduction in advances of about  100 millions(i.e. about 5 per cent) which would bring them back to their level at theend of January of this year.   The aim should be to achieve this reductionby the end of the year.   As for 1958/59 I propose that the level of advances be held at an average level 5 per cent below the level reached in the previous twelve months.   I believe that we can only secure thisby direct action on the level of advances rather than by attempting to operate through the liquidity ratio; and it may be that the banks them-selves would prefer that the ultimate responsibility of this action shouldbe the Governmenfs rather than to attempt to push far further the presentsystem of voluntary co-operation.   There are, of course, difficultiesin such a proposal, but they are as  nothing to those which will manifestthemselves if we drift on as we are.   It is possible, but by no means certain, that the Bank of England may wish, if such a step was taken, toraise the Bank Rate as well.   We need not consider this problem at thepresent time.2 5.    I do not think that it would be right, economically, politically orpsychologically, to take relatively drastic action to limit investmentwithout doing anything parallel to check consumption.   Experience hasshown that one of the quickest and most effective ways of reducingconsumption is through the statutory control over hire purchase terms.I am discussing with the President of the Board of Trade whether we might tighten this control for the time being.26.    The current directive to the Capital Issues Committee, dated17th February, 1956, instructs the Committee to &quot;recommend consentonly when it is satisfied that the purpose has a definite urgency undercurrent requirements&quot;.   I propose that this directive should be publiclyrestated and should be re-enforced by instructions to the Committee toapply it more stringently.   At the same time &quot;sponsoring Departments&quot;will be reminded that they should regard the Committee&apos;s instructions as applying to them when they report on applications.conclusions 7.    The above paragraphs describe the policies which I regard as necessary if we are to have any chance of maintaining the value of ourcurrency.   They are not easy.   Their success would probably be reflected in an increase in the level of unemployment to around 3 percent.   This would be forgiven us.   A collapse of the pound would not.2 8.    What I need now is approval of the general line of policy described above in order that I can make the necessary policy announcements before leaving for Washington and against which I can defend a parity level forsterling of $2. 80.   I do not attach the draft of such a statement, but itwould include the following points -(a) that we have no intention of going below $2. 80 either toa new parity or floating;(b) that our balance of payments outlook is healthy and we arenot out of line with the dollar;(c) that we intend to ensure that the volume of money availablefor public and private expenditure is limited in such a way as to prevent inflation.
P.T.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.7th September, 1957(d) that public expenditure in the investment fields (&apos;i. e. by-Government Departments, nationalised bodies and localauthorities) will be limited over the next two years to thepresent level and this will involve a reduction of 320 millions on present estimates of future expenditure,including, among other things, a substantial cut in public housing;(e) that the level of bank advances will be reduced and will beheld down until it can be increased with safety;(f) that since it would be wrong that investment should bear thewhole brunt, the level of consumption will be checked by atightening of hire purchase terms;(g) that we recognise that if the limitations in capitalexpenditure and in bank advances fail to moderate increases in wages, salaries and profits, there is bound to be resultingunemployment, until increased productivity can be achievedto compensate for such increases;(h) that the Government will persist in its measures and ifnecessary press them further as a prerequisite to achievingstable prices and a sound currency, recognising the hardshipwhich may be caused but which is preferable to the evilsof continued inflation.
