Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 17726th July, 1957CABINETOLD AGE pensions memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Lord Privy SealIt may be helpful if I outline in this Paper the points on which the cabinet will need to reach a decision at its next meeting, both as respects the long-term plan and as respects the intermediate operation.The Intermediate Operation2. It will be for the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance to adviseabout the practicability and the timing. I do not deal in this Paper with the tacticsin Parliament. What I say in these paragraphs applies whether the operationdates from next December or from next April.3.   The three points for decision are:  (i) The amount of the increase.(ii) The amount of the contribution.(iii) The tobacco concession.These three points are inter-related, and also depend to some extent on what is done about the long-term plan.The Amount of the Increase4. If the increase were only 5s., it is fairly certain that a further increase wouldbe necessary before the end of this Parliament i.e., before the introduction of afurther long-term plan. It would also be impossible to get rid of the tobaccoconcession. One of the reasons for an increase as much as 10s. is that the tobaccoconcession could go.5. An increase of 10s. is, however, about double what is required on cost-of-living grounds. Although it does not have an immediately unfavourable effect onthe Exchequer if heavily increased contributions are collected, it does not of coursecure the Exchequer^ difficulties: indeed, it increases them, though it alters the timing of their incidence. A decision in favour of 10s. can best be justified if it is accompanied by a decision to introduce a long-term plan which eases theExchequer&apos;s difficulties.6. We should also have to make it clear that this increase was designed tohold the situation until the introduction of the long-term plan i.e., whatever thesituation is during the remainder of this Parliament.51977
The Rate of Contribution7. If we decide that the present fiat-rate system is to be replaced in 1960by a new system, then what principally matters is to ensure that the burden on theExchequer is not too heavy during the next two or three years. If, on the otherhand, we decide that the flat-rate system is to continue indefinitely, we must? - consider fixing a contribution high enough to reduce substantially the emerging4* F deficit which would otherwise fall on the Exchequer with increasing severity as theyears go by. This would involve a heavily overloaded contribution say, a contribution of 18s. 4d. for men, which the Minister of Pensions originallysuggested, or even more.8. Assuming a 10s. rise and the abolition of the tobacco concession, and taking account of all the consequential factors, the extra charge on the Exchequer,as compared with the current year, would be about  35 million in 1958-59 if an18s. Ad. contribution were charged, and about  44 million if a 17s. 6d. contributionwere charged. In 1959-60 these figures would be  34 million and  75 million respectively. (The extra cost which the Exchequer would have to meet next year if no change were made in the National Insurance rates would be about  55 million as compared with this year. This is mainly due to the emerging deficit in the fund which it is our aim to reduce.)The Tobacco Concession9. I suggest that if we go to 10s., we should abolish the tobacco concession.If we do not, the figures of extra cost to the Exchequer given in the above paragraphwould be increased by  18-20 million. This shows the relative importance of doingaway with the tobacco concession.The Long-term  Plan10. The question for the Cabinet is whether they agree in principle to a plan on the lines indicated in paragraphs 9-13 and the Appendix of my previous paper(C. (57) 165) i.e., a graduated plan.11. My colleagues will see that the plan assumes that the basic benefits willbe 10s. higher than at present. If something higher still were contemplated, then the finances of the plan would have to be recast. This, therefore, ties in with thepoint I make in paragraph 6 above, viz., that we should recognise that an increaseof 10s. in the near future will not be followed by any further increases before theintroduction of the graduated plan.12. The Cabinet wished further consideration to be given to the question of&quot; contracting out &quot; that is, whether contributors who are members of an approvedoccupational scheme should be allowed to contract out of the top slice of the graduated plan (C.C. (57) 54th Conclusion, Minute 4). This means that they wouldforgo the graduated benefits in excess of the basic rate, and would be excused somuch of the contribution as relates to those benefits.13. Representatives of the insurance companies have indicated to us that,provided that the graduated element of the plan is kept as small as at present, theyare not too alarmed about the effect of the plan on the private sector, and theywould not themselves wish to ask for the plan to include a contracting-outprovision.  This removes one of the arguments for having such a provision.14. However, bearing in mind the wish expressed to include a &quot; contracting out&quot; provision, if practicable, we asked officials to have further discussions withthe representatives of the insurance companies.15. The contribution under the plan is 8 per cent, of all earnings. the contribution which would be excused would be about half the contribution on earnings in excess of  8. There would be substantial difficulties both for employersand for the Government in the collection of contributions at different rates for different contributors. It is thought that it would not be feasible to give individualoption, and that contracting out would have to apply to all members of a particularoccupational scheme, or to none.16. The occupational scheme would have to be &quot; approved,&quot; and conditions for that approval imposed. This would cause a good deal of friction and increasethe difficulties of administration.  The question would arise whether an employer
who was unwilling to adjust his scheme so as to comply with the conditions thusdebarring his employees from contracting out of the national scheme should be compelled to adjust it if the majority of his employees wished him to.17. It is impossible to estimate how many contributors would contract out.The effect of contracting out on the finances of the plan is to reduce the Fund&apos;income immediately without materially reducing its expenditure for many years to come. A rough estimate suggests that the loss to the Fund could well be asmuch as  50 millions a year if existing members of existing schemes were allowedto contract out. This loss would steadily increase if the right were extended to future members of existing schemes; it would increase still more if it were extendedto future schemes.18. To restore the finances of the scheme, it would be necessary to increasethe contribution. The alternative would be to put up the  750 limit, which waschosen with the deliberate object of so limiting the scheme&apos;s impact on the private sector that a provision for contracting out would be unnecessary. It is thought thatan increase in the top limit would render the scheme wholly unacceptable to theprivate sector.  It would in any case probably defeat its own object.19. Contracting out is important politically, but its inclusion, limited as itshould be to contribution to existing schemes, would have a serious effect on the finances of a graduated scheme and would make it necessary to recast it and toincrease the contributions. Apart from this financial difficulty there are practical problems which would need to be examined further.20. We must, however, decide in principle whether the next increase inflat-rate contributions and benefits is to be followed by the graduated scheme, sincethe amount of the increase and the new rate of contribution is affected by thisdecision. If we decide that the increase should be 10s. and the rate of contribution17s. 6d., .we could only do so in the light of a decision to introduce a graduated scheme, even if financial and practical difficulties may bring into doubt the praticability of contracting out.21. If the Cabinet decide in favour of the graduated scheme, moreconsideration will have to be given to such questions as whether sickness and unemployment benefit should have a graduated element on top of the increasedbasic benefit, the treatment of married women, and the question of pension ages.I suggest that the National Insurance Committee should remain in being in orderto handle these questions.R.
