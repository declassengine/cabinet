THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. July 1957SECRET Copy No. 58C. (57) 17219th July, 1957CABINETNEW TOWNSMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh, AffairsThe Secretary of State for Scotland and I propose that statements should bemade in the House before the summer recess on the Government^ policy aboutthe future administration of New Towns. The substance of that policy, whichwas approved by the Home Affairs Committee, is that the land and buildings atpresent owned by the Development Corporations should not, when the Townsare substantially completed, be handed over to the local authorities as providedfor by the New Towns Act, 1946, but that legislation should be introduced tobring about a different arrangement.2. So far as concerns England and Wales, where some New Towns arenearing completion, my proposal is to announce that a new Government agencywould be established to own, manage and, as appropriate, dispose of the assets;and that a Departmental Committee should be set up to advise on the organisationappropriate for the purpose. The Scottish New Towns, none of which will becompleted for several years, would be left over for consideration at some futurestage.3. I attach a copy of the statement Ihave had it in mind to make, as amended in the light of discussion by the Home Affairs Committee.4. The Committee requested that their conclusions be brought to the attentionof the Prime Minister. He has asked that the matter should be brought before theCabinet so that they may decide whether it is necessary to make a statement at thisstage.5. I have two main reasons for wishing to make a Government statementnow:  (a) Before we can frame the amending legislation, there are several questions to be answered about the sort of organisation we should set up and itsrelationship to both central and local government. On these we need the assistance of people not in Government service; people in the NewTown Corporations, in local government, in estate and housingmanagement. In order to start the necessary discussions we must havea public announcement of some kind, otherwise there is bound to bea leakage to the Press: and a statement to the House appears to be themost appropriate course. Since, in my view, we ought to do our best to legislate before the Election, it is essential to start these discussions very soon.(b) I am told by Members for New Town constituencies that they consider anearly statement of policy to be imperative. Continued uncertainty aboutthe Governments intentions is raising acute anxieties among theindustrialists and others with capital sunk in the Towns (who feartransfer of ownership to the authorities). The Chairmen of all the New51923
Town Corporations would welcome a statement, to put an end touncertainties. Most of those concerned have the notion that theGovernment intend to amend the Act, but no one can be sure. I thinkthat the New Town Members are right, and that relationships in theNew Towns are becoming unnecessarily difficult for want of a clear statement.6. We cannot legislate next Session. Apart from the fact that the necessaryParliamentary time could not be found, we need &quot; outside &quot; advice before we canput forward detailed proposals. If we are to do the job properly, and carry thepublic with us, it is desirable not merely to consult outside opinion, but to do it insuch a way as to reassure the inhabitants of the Towns, and to avoid creating any impression that the Government are settling their future without giving everyoneconcerned a reasonable chance of being heard. I think there may be conflictingviews about the form of the organisation to be adopted: some will be for centralisedcontrol, with no representation for local opinion, others for a form more amenable to local feelings. I would not want to appear to determine such matters without seeking views both from those who understand large-scale estate management, andfrom those who have experience, on the ground, of the New Town problems. nor would I want to produce proposals about housing management without consultingexperts in that field. Even if we decided not to have a Committee (and it wouldin my view be a mistake so to decide) it would still be necessary to make an announcement, so that we could in other ways openly consult those whose advicewe need.7. I appreciate that a statement in the House invites the Opposition to openan attack. No doubt they will do so. But their attack is more likely to concentrate on the policy to be adopted by the new agency when it is established,than on the decision to establish it. They will not find it easy to decry the basicproposition that, on financial grounds, the assets must be retained in Governmentownership for some time to come; and even if some Opposition Members wereprepared to maintain that the whole of the New Towns enterprise ought at some stage to pass into the hands of the local authorities, I have reason to think thatothers, taking a longer view, are uneasy at that prospect. The statement is likelyto be universally popular with Government supporters.8. It must be kept in mind that during next Session there will be necessity tointroduce a Bill (for which a place is being kept) to authorise increased Exchequeradvances to the New Towns. I am certain to be pressed then for a statement ofmy intentions; and I would feel much happier about handling that debate and asking the House for more money if an announcement had previously been made.9. I ask accordingly that I may be authorised to announce the Government^intentions before the recess which I could do in answer to an arranged question or otherwise.H. B.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,18th July, 1957.
AnnexStatement on the Future Administration of New Towns in England and wales to be made by the. Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentSeveral of the Development Corporations set up, under the new Towns Act,1946, in England and Wales, will substantially complete the building of their townsduring the next few years. The Government accordingly consider that the time hascome to review the provisions of the Act for winding up the Corporations and forthe subsequent ownership of their properties.2. The Act provides that when the purposes for which a Corporation was setup are &quot; substantially achieved &quot; the Corporation will be wound up unless financial considerations make it expedient to defer doing so; and that the undertaking, or anypart of it, may then be transferred, on terms to be settled, to the local authority (or authorities) within whose area the new town is situated.3. The Government have however come to the conclusion that it would be impracticable to reach a satisfactory settlement for wholesale transfer as envisaged by the Act, especially as the towns will be far from having reached a financialequilibrium by the time the Corporations have completed their tasks.4. In any event the Government do not consider that it would be desirable for a large part of the land and buildings in any town to be owned by localauthorities. In their view the ultimate objective should be to make the new townsas much like normal towns as possible; and this implies diverse ownership.5. There can be no doubt that on financial grounds the Government should,for years to come, retain ownership of a good deal of the property. the corporations are financed by advances from the Consolidated Fund, and up to31st March last the advances to the English and Welsh towns amounted to about 155 millions. The advances are repayable, with interest, over 60 years. Revenueis building up, but this is necessarily a slow process. Some of the Corporations arealready earning enough to meet their annual repayments; but it will be many years before they overtake the accumulated deficits, due mainly to their early heavy expenditure on the provision of main services. If the Exchequer is ever to recoverwhat has been spent and is being spent on developing the towns, the government must postpone disposal of the properties until the opportunity is favourable.6. This could, perhaps, be achieved under the Act by retaining the corporations in being. But these Corporations have been established to carry outdevelopment; and a different sort of agency is required once the development is substantially completed. The Government accordingly propose to amend the new towns Act.7. The amending legislation will provide for the establishment ofCommissioners who will take over the property and the liabilities of the corporations in England and Wales as they are wound up, and will thereaftermanage their estates.8. The Commissioners will be required to manage the property, and to dispose of it as and when appropriate, with the object of recovering the maximum returnfor the Exechequer, proper regard being paid to the interests of the inhabitants ofthe towns. They will retain, either directly or through associations established forthe purpose, the ownership of the rented nouses, though the sale of some of these to the local authorities would not be excluded.9. Various questions arise on the best form of organisation for this purpose,and before reaching conclusions on this it will be desirable to have the advice of experts on organisation, estate management, including house management, and finance. Ministerial responsibility must be retained; and the right relationship between the Commissioners and the Government is a matter requiring examination.The relationship between the Commissioners and local government is also important, and on this the representatives of local authorities should be consulted.For these purposes I propose to appoint a small Committee whose terms ofreference will be to advise upon the arrangements to be made to give effect to theGovernment^ decision that Commissioners should be established for the purposesdescribed in the foregoing announcement.
