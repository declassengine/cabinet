WHITE PAPER ON OVERSEAS INFORMATION services. As a nation Great Britain has a great deal to offer in the shaping of world&apos; society. We have brought to a fine art the working of democraticinstitutions. We have high standards of justice, tolerance and truth. We have great resources of scientific knowledge and inventiveness. We possess industrialskill of the highest order. Yet we delude ourselves if we think that in afiercely competitive world these things are self evident. We can exerciseour full influence only if we are prepared to devote enough effort and resources to ensuring that the peoples of other countries have every opportunity to understand our ideas, our policies and our objectives. Further-more we shall strengthen our economic position only if our efforts includevigorous salesmanship overseas.2. Through the information services policy is promoted and public opinioninfluenced. They are a means by which men&apos;s minds are drawn towardsthe acceptance of the values, the political and economic objectives and thesocial standards for which this country stands. We must apply to their organisation the principles and practices proved to be effective in other fields of public communication.3. Our information services must reflect the interests and prestige of GreatBritain as the centre of a unique Commonwealth of free nations. They mustleave the world in no doubt that Britain&apos;s colonial record is one of enlighten-ment and.steady progress. They must create understanding of our economic prospects and trade policies, foster I goodwill towards British products, iandinform the world of our technological and scientific progress. They mustpresent the picture of a people, proud of the past but living in the presentand confident of the future a reliable ally and a tenacious and resourcefulopponent.4. It is with such considerations in mind that the Government has re-examined our Overseas Information Services, taking as the starting point theReport summarised in a White Paper published in 1953 of the independent committee of Enquiry into Overseas Information Services, under the Chair-manship of Lord Drogheda. They have drawn fully upon the analysis, thearguments and the conclusions of this document.5. The information effort must be geared to policy and deployed accordingto certain general principles as well as to geographical priorities. It mustswiftly react to any change of emphasis in policy which events may require.6. The objectives of information activity, political and economic, shouldbe clearly defined and fully understood by information staff both for general application and to meet the particular requirements of individual areas. the primary emphasis should be placed on retaining the goodwill and under-standing of our friends and on winning the respect of uncommitted countries.Stability and continuity of effort are needed if the maximum impact is tobe achieved. While it is essential to attract and retain the sympathy of theinfluential few in each country, it is important in many areas to enlist the goodwill of the mass audiences. The structure of Information services should be such as to enable the emphasis to be switched, as the need may arise, from one area to another.The Structure7. The &quot;field&quot; elements of the Information staffs are maintained abroadmainly by the Overseas Departments the Foreign Office, the Commonwealth
Relations Office, the Colonial Office and the British Council. Besides servingtheir parent departments these staffs work for the Board of Trade. The centralservices are mainly supplied by the headquarters of the Overseas Departments,the British Council, the B.B.C. and the Central Office of Information.8. The Government have examined the Information Services in &quot; thefield&quot; in relation to the basic principles summarised in paragraph 6. In anumber of respects there is need for redeployment and some, augmentation.Today the Foreign Office engages in considerable information activity, inthe United States, in. .N.A.T.O. countries particularly in Germany-in theMiddle East and in South-East Asia. Additional information staff and equip-ment will be provided in Burma, Indonesia, Iran, Morocco, Persian Gulf,and Tunisia. In the Commonwealth there are information services in all member-countries. These will be strengthened in Australia, Canada, Pakistan,Ghana and the Federation of Malaya: a new information office will be opened in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Increased provision will bemade for visitors to and from Commonwealth countries. The Information workof the Colonial Office is carried out partly through its own offices in theWest Indies and Nigeria and partly through the Information Offices of colonial Governments. Additional provision is to be made in Nigeria, andnew Services are to be provided in East Africa and Singapore.Central Office of Information9. It is to the,Central Office of Information that the Overseas Depart-ments look for the supply of material and services to the Information posts.It is an excellent organisation with an output of high quality. The Governmenthas decided to strengthen the service for overseas posts. The magazines whichthe C.O.I. supplies to the Commonwealth and the Middle East will be improved and new magazines introduced. There will be more prestigeexhibitions in the Commonwealth, more provision for official visitors whocome to see Britain and the British way of life for themselves, an expansion and improvement of the London Press Service (sent daily by radio to most *- p&amp;rts of the free world), of the photographic services, and of the newsreelssent to the Middle East. Lastly, there is to be further development of theCentral Office of Information film and television services, dealt with in asubsequen t section of this paper.Overseas Broadcasting. 10. The 1952 Licence and Agreement with the B.B.C. provides that&quot; The Corporation shall consult and collaborate with the [oversea] depart-ments, and shall obtain and accept from them such information regardingconditions&apos;in, arid the policies of Her Majesty&apos;s Government towards, thecountries so prescribed and other countries as will enable the corporation to plan and prepare its programmes in its external services in the national interest&quot;. In i short the B.B.C. enjoys independence of programme content.It is required to consult, to listen and to enquire and then to plan its pro-grammes in the national interest. In the Governments view this independenceshould be maintained. The impartial and objective character of the B.B.C.&apos;streatment of controversial subject-matter is a national asset.11. The difficult day-to-day problem of translating policy into terms ofbroadcast scripts calls for close liaison between Overseas Departments andthe B.B.C. on a. basis of mutual confidence and understanding. arrangements have been riaade for such liaison. . ,
12. The external services of the B.B.C. at present cost nearly  5$ millions a year including nearly  400,000 for the monitoring service. Hours of weeklybroadcasting overseas are as follows:  Areas WeeklyHoursEurope (including Iron Curtain countries)......... 158 General Overseas Service in English       ......... 147Russia and satellites   .................. 78$Middle East    ...................... 66iCommonwealth (self-governing)      ......      ...... 64 *Latin America         .................. 29JSouth-East Asia and Far East        ...      ...... 26iCommonwealth (Colonies)    .........58213. There are certain ways in which overseas broadcasting need to be expanded. The Government has already approved the expansion of the B.B.C.Arabic service from 4J hours to 9  hours a day. It has decided to approve the restoration of the General Overseas Service from 21 to 24 hours daily ;the expansion of sound transcription service output; further development inprogramme expenditure, publicity and audience research; new services inHausa, Swahili and Somali; minor extension of service to Russia and poland and certain other minor adjustments. The estimated annual cost of theseexpansions is  258.000.14. Much of the B.B.C.&apos;s equipment needs replacing or modernising.Two transmitters which began service in 1932 need to be replaced now, asdo two others installed in 1937. There is a long-term programme for progres-sive replacement of the remaining transmitters over a period of 15 years.Improved wave-changing facilities and aerial switching arrangements arerequired on six transmitters. Consideration needs to be given to the adequacy of existing relay facilities. This programme of capital replacement the Govern-ment has approved in principle and will discuss its phasing with theCorporation.15. The Government has decided that in the Middle East there is neededa &quot; light&quot; programme, locally produced, commercial in character and likelyto make an appeal to the largest possible audience. It is considering arrange-ments to this end.16. The Drogheda Committee recommended the complete abolition of theFrench, Italian, Danish, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish and Portuguese services.These services still command a certain audience, and there is a danger ofmistaken political conclusions being drawn from their abandonment. But theaudience for these services is smaller than it was at the end of the war andis likely to decline still further with the growth of television and V.H.F.broadcasting. In some parts of Europe, B.B.C. broadcasts are becomingprogressively more difficult to hear in comfort as the ether becomes morecrowded. And Western Europe is an area with which we possess many othereffective means of communication.17. Nevertheless, the Government has decided against the complete abolition of all these services. The closing down of the transmitting stationsinvolved would mean the weakening of the transmissions across the Iron* Includes the North American service (40 hours) and &quot; London CallingAsia in English &quot; (5^ hours).
Curtain. For this reason and as an earnest of its continuing interest in western europe, the Government will ask the B.B.C. to continue broadcasting to thearea in the main European languages, i.e., English, French, German, italian and Spanish, though certain reductions will be made in some of those services.These reductions, together with certain other minor economies, will bring atotal saving of some  200,000 a year. These include the contraction of thescope of the French and Italian services ; the integration of services to austria and Germany ; the abolition of the Portuguese, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedishand Danish services.Television18. As a means of international broadcasting, the scope of television isas yet very limited. And in many countries, there is no early prospect of television supplanting sound broadcasting. Nevertheless, television is a power-ful medium of growing scope and importance. Our information services must take full advantage of the opportunities it offers. The demand for televisionmaterial of all kinds news, entertainment, educational and political material is growing fast and we must expect competition from other countries in meeting it.19. The Central Office of Information is responsible to the overseas departments for obtaining material for showing on television overseas, con-tracting with broadcasting bodies, the documentary film industry, and news-reel companies for its production. The material includes news, material witha direct political message and background material to illustrate Britishachievements and the British way of life.20. The Central Office of Information are now supplying T.V. material for 32 territories and much of it is shown in the cinemas as well. It includesmonthly television interview programmes for Canada, Australia and the UnitedStates.21. The B.B.C. supplies material directly to Europe, through Eurovision,and to Commonwealth countries and the United States in the form of tele-recordings of programmes originally broadcast in the Home television service. The programme companies of the Independent Television authority are doing an increasing business in selling tele-recordings overseas. In news-reels there is growing activity. The B.B.C. is collaborating with a commercialundertaking^ the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation j and the AustralianBroadcasting Commission for the distribution of newsreel material abroadthrough the British Commonwealth International News Film Agency Ltd.which will &quot; provide a service of International news on film for subscribersanywhere in the world &quot;. The Independent Television News Company hassecured the showing of its newsreel material through exchange and salearrangements in many countries including Canada, Australia, the UnitedStates, France and South America. The Government strongly welcome suchdevelopments. These are commercial activities and no cost falls on theGovernment.22. The Government has decided on an expansion in its television activities.In so far as the various agencies concerned with the promotion of televisionoverseas, including the B.B.C., can secure the export of their own materialthey are warmly encouraged to do so. Where the BJB.C. or the programme companies of the I.T.A. produce for home consumption television material which the Foreign Office, the Commonwealth Relations Office, the ColonialOffice or the Board of Trade feuad/useful to have exhibited in an overseas I ftmk % Varea although commercial showing would be unremunerative, the central office of Information will be authorised to acquire the rights in that material
for the area concerned. In this way the broadcasting bodies will be free toextend their activities on a sale or exchange basis and, by arrangement withthe Government Information Services, to secure the showing of material in areas where there is no prospect of economic return.23. The Central Office of Information contracting with the B.B.C., Inde-pendcnt Television Authority programme companies and film producingcompanies as appropriate will substantially increase its activity and expendi-ture in the development of -television material. As a first step C.O.I plan tooffer about an hour a week of British material to the principal stations inmost countries (other than behind the Iron Curtain) where television operates.The C.O.I. expect to employ the full range of the film and television producingindustries in this country. They will provide for example, a weekly ColonialNews; a weekly Arabic News; a weekly news service for South Americaand corresponding services for Commonwealth countries. They are doubling the existing series of Commonwealth Televiews and will introduce seriesprogrammes in foreign languages. They will also supply to selected postsoverseas libraries of background shots of material about Britain for use intelevision programmes. They already have extensive arrangements with british commercial and industrial firms for the acquisition of film material, and they intend to develop and exploit these more intensively for presentation abroadon television as a general background to British achievement.24. This television service is still in an early and experimental stage andthese arrangements should be regarded as a first step.British Council25. Careful study has been made of the work of the British Council, whichis an independent body though largely financed from public funds. Thefundamental principle which underlies all British Council work is that it mustbe of benefit both to the United Kingdom and to the &quot; receiving &quot; country:The work, though it has political and commercial effects in the broadestsense, is confined to the educational, scientific, professional and cultural fields.For such long-term work as this stability is no less important than expansion.The Government is greatly impressed by the high quality of material which itproduces and the valuable work which it does in fostering contacts withinfluential individuals, particularly in the professional classes and. withstudents who are likely to be leaders of opinion in their own countries. Alarge part of its resources is devoted to the care of students who come to thiscountry from the Commonwealth and from foreign countries, and to the teaching of English. The Government attaches the highest importance to both these activities. It has been suggested that the British Council is concerned only with the encouragement of the more high-brow of the arts. In fact only  per cent, of the CounciPs total expenditure goes on drama, music and thefine arts.26. After consulting the British Council, the Government has decidedthat certain extensions are urgently necessary. These are in relation firstly toits overseas posts and secondly to the teaching of English. In the foreign fieldthere is to be expansion in Burma, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, the Persian Gulf,South America, the Sudan, Thailand, Turkey and Yugoslavia. In the Com-commonwealth there is to be expansion in Ceylon, India, and Pakistan; in theColonies in Hong Kong, Nigeria and Uganda.27. The English language is a commodity: in great demand all over theworld. It is a key to our literature and so to our culture. It is a valuable andcoveted export for which many nations are prepared to pay. English is an.export likely to attract other exports-British advisers and technicians, British
technological or university education and British plant and equipment. Thereare clear commercial advantages to be gained from increasing the number of potential customers who can read technical and trade publicity materialwritten in English.28. The demand for the teaching of English greatly exceeds the supply.There is need to stimulate recruitment of United Kingdom teachers of english. The main factors which deter United Kingdom teachers from takingposts overseas (other than in the Colonies) are lack of assurance aboutadequate salary and security of contract and uncertainty of re-employment on return.29. The Government has decided that teachers going overseas (except to appointments in colonial territories with Colonial Governments) shouldhave a contract where possible with the British Council, which will accept responsibility for filling: the post on behalf of the oversea authority. Wherethe need is proved, the&quot; Government will consider making up the differencebetween the salary paid overseas and what is here regarded as sufficient to attract teachers to take such overseas posts.30. The Ministry of Education and the Scottish Office will establish an agency to assist both the Colonial Office and the British Council in recruitingteachers for overseas posts including teachers for subjects other than theEnglish language. This agency will facilitate contacts between these two bodies and education authorities and help in the work of reinstatement on the teacher&apos;s return.31. Scholarships will be established 50 in the first year rising to 100in the fourth year to enable additional key students from overseas to cometo this country for training in teaching English as a foreign language. Pro-vision will be made for the training of teachers in English as a foreignlanguage within the public teachers training scheme. Steps will be taken tostrengthen the existing arrangements for the training of oversea teachers intheir own countries.32. The B.B.C. will be asked not only to expand its &quot; English by radio &quot;programmes but also to consider the inclusion of more such material in other programmes.33. The Government have decided on other forms of expansion in theBritish CounciFs central services. They include the necessary staff expansionat headquarters and in the regions, an improved staff pension scheme, theincreased supply of British Council books and periodicals to libraries, andthe expansion of the British CounciFs programme for the care of visitors,including courses, studentships and bursaries, chiefly from the Commonwealth,the Middle East and Turkey. It has been decided to increase the grants avail-able for the inter-university exchange scheme, for the expansion of studentwelfare services and for a modest expansion of the arts programme to be concentrated on drama.Future Co-ordination34. The review upon which these decisions have been based has been concentrated on the structure of British Information Services. But more needs to be done to ensure that the quality is high. For example, there is neededa central focus to co-ordinate Overseas information activities, to formulatecommon themes expressing policy and to translate them into informationactivity by the various Departments and agencies. There are problems of staffing and training to be examined. Opportunity and encouragement shouldbe provided for people and interests outside the Government service to play
their part. The full impact of Britain&apos;s influence can. only be achieved if the cultural, industrial, commercial and social elements which make up the Britishdemocratic community are enabled to play their fullest part. The officialservice is but part of the whole.35. To deal with these and other problems and to co-ordinate the overseas information services, the necessary administrative arrangements, Ministerialand official, have been made. There will be no encroachment on the responsi-bility of individual Ministers for the work of their information staffs. Nor is there any intention to establish a Ministry of Information,Cost36. The estimated cost in a full year of the expanded services is of theorder of  15 million, compared with the  13 million now expended, though this figure is unlikely to be reached for some time. The expansion envisagedtherefore is of the order of 15 per cent in terms of annual revenue expenditure.In addition the capital items envisaged may cost up to  5  million spreadover 15 years. This expansion is necessary to maintain Britain&apos;s information services at a level consistent with our world-wide responsibility and to ensurethe necessary reinforcement of our political and economic policies, and our association in the defence of the free world.(30215) wt.Printed and published in Great Britain by her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office2, 100  7/57  d.l.
