1   : -      95(ThJs. DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL******C.(57) 166 COPY NO.15th July, 1957CABINETJUTE industry note by the president  of the Board of trade the Prime Minister has asked me to inform my colleagues ofthe terms of the attached statement on the jute industry which has been authorised by the Economic Policy Committee and which I am proposing to make after Questions on Wednesday.2.      Arrangements have been made for the Secretary of State forScotland and me to see the x,ord Provost of Dundee and representativesof both sides of the industry on Tuesday afternoon.D.E.Board of Trade, S.W.1.15th July, 1957PROPOSED STATEMENT TO parliament on THE JUTE industry as the House is aware the jute industry is protected by a uniquesystem of State trading.   The Jute Control is the sole importer of thegreat bulk of jute goods supplied from overseas.   It sells these goods at prices comparable with those at which an efficient cross section of the domestic industry can put equivalent goods on the market.2. These arrangements, particularly as they affect hessians importedfor making sacks, are increasingly operating against the interest of users of jute goods and of jute as an industrial material.3.       There are two reasons for this.First the price of jute sacks has to be kept so high that agricultural and industrial users are penalised.
Second because the price is so high there is a growing substitution of other materials in the making of sacks.4.       This state of affairs is causing concern to those who make and usejute sacks in this country and also in India and Pakistan; it would not berealistic to allow it to continue.   I have discussed the problem with bothsides of the industry, and decided, at this stage, to alter the basis ofthe Control&apos;s selling prices for the principal types of hessians importedfor making sacks.5.       The mark-up for these hessians is now about 40 per cent.   Thiswill be reduced to a flat  30 per cent.6.       As a result sacks made out of imported jute cloth will be cheaper.This will affect the production of the home industry unless it can reduceits costs.   But if no reduction in the price of jute sacks is made, themarket for them will inevitably be lost to substitutes.7.       The Government believe that the best prospect for Dundee andthe surrounding area is increased diversification of industry.   I am confident that firms in the jute industry will do their utmost to adapttheir resources to changing conditions.   The Government, for their part,will step up their efforts to get new industries to go to the Dundee area.Over the past ten years the new factories which have been started in thearea have provided nearly 6,000 new jobs; factory building now in progress will further increase the jobs available.   The Board of Trade will meet any reasonable request to provide additional factory space for leasing to firms already established and to others coming into the area for the first time, and in appropriate cases Treasury loans to such firms will beavailable under the Distribution of Industry Acts.
