THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1957SECRET Copy No.C. (57) 1541st July, 1957CABINETTHE AIRCRAFT industry memorandum by the Minister of supply the difficulties of the aircraft industry have become such that the government need to consider their future policy towards it.2.   The industry has a two-fold importance:  (i) It provides the means, whether these be manned or unmanned, both ofdelivering the nuclear deterrent and of defending it; its efficiency istherefore indispensable to an effective deterrent policy.(ii) It has become an industry of considerable economic consequence.   its work involves the application of a high degree of technical skill to a relatively small quantity of imported raw materials. It is an industry of rapidly developing technique, and its progress has brought in its trainaccompanying advances in other fields e.g., metallurgy, lightengineering, fuel efficiency, electrics and electronics advances whichwould certainly not have been achieved without its stimulus. By its nature therefore it is very much the kind of industry we ought to have.Further, it is our second largest individual exporter of engineering products, with exports now running at over  100 million a year. To theextent that United Kingdom and other Commonwealth air operatorspurchase its products instead of importing from abroad it saves foreign currency, chiefly dollars; e.g., the adoption by the British overseas airways Corporation of the Vickers VC. 10 will avoid spending over 100 million in dollars. At the present rate of increase, world air trafficwill double itself in the next six years. There is a strong presumptionof economic advantage in seeking to capture as large a share as possible of the resulting market for aircraft and aero-engines and so reapingthe maximum dividend from our past investment in the industry.3. These two considerations, the military and the civil, reinforce each other.The military demand helps the industry the better to equip itself for its commercialbattles indeed it has been the foundation on which the industry has been built;while the commercial demand conduces to the better discharge of the militaryfunction. And the industry has grown up as one, serving alike military and civilaviation.4. The industry&apos;s main overseas competitor is the American aircraft industry,which enjoys the natural advantage of a large domestic market and thus theprospect of a handsome return to offset the inevitably heavy outlay on research and development.5. This natural advantage of the American industry has been   reinforced byState action in two main forms:  (i) Research,  carried out  by  the National  Advisory  Committee forAeronautics, the United States Air Force and the United States Navy,has been, conducted almost entirely with State fund is.(ii) The military demand for aircraft for transport purposes- ha* been a-powerful? addition to the civil demand and more often* than not has51836
preceded it. For example, military orders for the Service version ofthe Boeing strato--Cruiser numbered over 850. And the Boeing 707 is largely identical with the KC. 135 tanker, for which there are also verylarge military orders. In contrast, R.A.F. Transport Commands ordersfor Britannias and Comets are 20 and 13 respectively.6. Another State-supported though weaker competitor is the French aircraft industry, which is partly nationalised, while in the longer term formidablecompetition is threatened by the Russians.7. In Britain, State support of the industry has been given in the following ways:  (i) Research work has been carried out in Ministry of Supply Establishments,e.g., the Royal Aircraft Establishment and the National Gas TurbineEstablishment, with assistance from the National Physical Laboratoryand the Universities. The Establishments have also given assistance in overcoming specific difficulties with new civil types, e.g., the Comet andthe Britannia engine. Sometimes, when it has been a question of tryingout ideas of special novelty, the Ministry of Supply has placed contracts with one or more chosen firms for the design and construction ofexperimental aircraft.(ii) In the case of aircraft for operational use, military or civil, the productionorder has usually been preceded by a development contract placed bythe Ministry of Supply with a chosen firm. The State has usuallycontributed the whole cost of development in the case of military aircraft, and the major part of the cost of developing civil aircraft. Inreturn for its contribution the State receives a levy (now running at 5-6 million a year) on all aircraft sold to non-Government customers.State contributions to the development of civil aircraft were begun afterthe war as part of the policy of re-establishing the industry in civil aircraft manufacture. In the early days there was little expectation of recovering the whole or even a substantial part of the original Stateoutlay. In recent years, however, the situation has changed and thecompanies themselves have been contributing increasingly to the costof development as well as bearing the initial cost of production.8. In both the United States and the United Kingdom, then, research has beenfinanced by the State; but in the case of civil operational aircraft, State support inthe United States has been indirect by way of orders, while in the United Kingdomit has been direct by way of a financial contribution to development, thoughdecreasingly so.9. The White Paper on Defence cannot but make infinitely more difficult the transition from Government finance for civil aircraft to private venture. Not onlydo the reductions in military orders reduce the turnover on which overheads canbe recovered; they also deprive the civil side of some of the benefit of theexperimentation which first took place in the military field. The principles governing flight are the same, whether the purpose is military or civil; but themain advances have first been pioneered in military aviation and subsequentlyadapted to civil use. For instance: nearly every aero-engine that has powered a civil aircraft and half the civil aircraft in the world have British aero-engines was first tried out in a military aircraft, so that its safety and reliability were provedbefore it was brought into civil use. For the first time since the war there is nowno forward-looking aero-engine in the programme. Nor can work on guided weapons, though a branch of the general science of aeronautics, contribute, asdid that on manned military aircraft, to the technical advance of civil aircraft.In our new situation the British aircraft industry has been suddenly and severelyhit, while its American rival is untouched, and there arises in an acute form thequestion how research and development for civil purposes is henceforth to be done.10. The cost of research and of experimental aircraft, while of ultimatebenefit both to military and civil aviation, has hitherto been borne as part of thecost of defence. Similarly the cost of developing an aero-engine, though itssubsequent application may have been civil as well as military, has been carriedon the Defence Budget. What is to happen to this work of potential civil use inthe light of the reduced emphasis on military aircraft? To discontinue it or to stop it at an arbitrary point e.g., limiting it to below certain speeds would block
further progress both in manned aircraft and guided missiles and sooner or laterleave us so far behind other countries that we should be forced to retire from theair business altogether. To saddle the industry with the cost of research wouldbe to impose a burden which not even its more powerful American competitorbears and would sink it. I suggest that while we must seek to shape the industryso as to increase its self-reliance still further, we must also maintain the momentumof forward research at Government expense and give effective, if graduallydiminishing, State support to the development of selected civil projects.11. The industry must clearly contract to a size commensurate with the reduced military load. But if the civil role is to expand, the units of the industry,while fewer in number, must also be made individually more powerful, financially,in their technical and production resources, and in their sales and servicingorganisations overseas. Government influence should therefore be brought to bearto hasten the formation of suitable groupings.12.   In outline I recommend the following policy:  (i) The Government should use their power both of persuasion and of contracts to shape the industry into units which are fewer in numberbut larger in size.(ii) The one consideration which above all others will induce a manufacturerto develop a new civil aircraft as a private venture is an initial domesticorder of adequate size. The Government should therefore seek, where possible, to match together the requirements of the Corporations andof Transport Command so as to ensure that the initial domestic order is as large as possible. The machinery for this already exists in theTransport Aircraft Requirements Committee.(iii) In the light of their success with (i) and (ii) above, the Government shouldincreasingly look to the industry itself to finance the cost of developingcivil aircraft and their engines. Individual projects will, however, need to be examined on their merits. And certain major projects, such asa supersonic transport with its related engine, and a helicopter of advanced design, will not be realisable without a considerable measureof Government finance.(iv) The momentum of research and of experimental aircraft work should bemaintained and its cost should continue to be borne by theGovernment. There should, however, be an increasing shift to thecivil Budget from the defence Budget, and applied research should be increasingly directed to the transport role of aircraft in place of thecombat role. This change of ultimate objective should lead to some reduction in expenditure under the general head of research.13.  I seek the approval of my colleagues for this policy.A. J.Ministry of Supply, W.C. 2,28th June, 1957.
