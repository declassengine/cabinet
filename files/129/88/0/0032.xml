Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1957SECRETC. (57) 18230th July, 1957CABINETTHE ECONOMIC COST OF INDUSTRIAL DISPUTESMemorandum by the Prime MinisterSome time ago, I asked for an assessment to be made of the economic effects of major strikes. This has been studied by officials of the Departments mainly concerned, who have now submitted the attached report. Their findings are brieflystated in the summary prefixed to the report. The main points which emerge arethe following:  (1) The economic damage caused by strikes seems to be less than is commonlybelieved (see paragraph 14 of the summary).(2) The strike which would be most damaging to the economy would be astrike at electric power stations: this, happily, is not very probable. Next after this would be a long strike on coal-mining or railways the latter being criticalmainly because it would stop the movement of coal. Engineering is such a large part of industry that a complete stoppage for a period of weeks would be bound tobe damaging. A nation-wide dock strike would be less damaging industriallythan a strike affecting coal, but it would soon have serious effects on food supplies.(3) The report deals only with strikes in major industries. There are, ofcourse, many particularly sensitive parts of the economy not here analysed in detailwhere strikes (e.g., by drivers of oil tanker lorries) would have effects on the economydisproportionate to the numbers engaged and the wage issues at stake.(4) The duration of a strike is, of course, a crucial factor. If a stoppage in akey sector lasted for more than about four weeks the damage could be very great.But, as I read the arguments in paragraphs 11-17 of the main report, it seems unlikely that a strike for a wage increase would last for so long provided, ofcourse, that the door was being kept open to a reasonable settlement and that noCopy No.3
issues emerged which would lead the Unions to believe that their fundamentalrights were being challenged. If such issues were raised, the strike might spreadrapidly to other industries. And it should be remembered that the estimates ofeconomic damage given in this report are made on the basis that each of the possiblestrikes examined is taken in isolation.(5) The Emergency Organisation is in good order, but we must remember the limitations on its use (paragraph 26 of the main report). It is not a strike-breakingorganisation, and it cannot be used for the purpose of mitigating the economiceffects of a strike. It can be invoked only for the purposes of preserving order and maintaining supplies &quot; essential to the life of the community,&quot; and it cannotbe used at all in a strike which does not imperil those supplies.(6) In paragraph 9 of the summary attention is rightly drawn to the importanceof coal stocks as a factor in enabling the economy to withstand the disruptionof a major strike.(7) The report does not examine the damage to the economy caused byacceptance of exorbitant wage demands. In terms of the internal and externalvalue of the currency, the damage on this score may well be greater than the damage from a stoppage provided, of course, that the strike is ultimately settledon less exorbitant terms.(8) Paragraph 3 of the main report is of interest as showing that the workersin nationalised industries have not fared better in wage claims over the last fewyears than workers in industry generally. Although they have sometimes led theway as the Transport Commission settlement did this year this has not alwaysbeen the case.(9) The main conclusion which emerges is that we should try to correct the view which has recently gained ground among the public and the Press thatit is the Governments duty in the interests of the national economy to preventstrikes at almost any cost. Obviously the Governments attitude to a strike must depend on the circumstances in each particular case and cannot be decided as amatter of general principle in advance. But it seems to me that we should emphasise the economic damage of cost inflation rather than the economic damageof stoppages of production.H. M.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,29th July, 1957.
INDUSTRIAL DISPUTESNote by officials. We were asked to assess the main probable effects on the economy of major strikes, particularly in the transport and power industries.2. We must first emphasise that there is little recent experience on which todraw. The post-war years have been free from widespread and protractedstoppages. Much less working time has been lost even than in the 1930&apos;s; andthe loss has been trivial compared with the 1920&apos;s. Even in times of full employment, thirty times as much time is lost from unemployment as fromstoppages.  (Part II of the attached report.)3. Many of the major stoppages have not been on wages issues at all. the comparatively small number of serious strikes on wages issues since the war is largely due to the fact that in the inflationary conditions that have prevailedemployers have been more ready to make concessions, and this also explains the short duration of the strikes that have occurred. It is impossible to say what wouldbe the outcome if a major strike were keenly contested. Since the big strikes of ageneration ago, there has been a transformation in the wage-earners&apos; economicand social conditions. Some of the changes greatly strengthen the unions&apos;resistance power; some weaken it. In the meantime it would be imprudent in theextreme to doubt the unions&apos; ability to command the full and continued supportof their members.  (Part III.)4. We have considered the Emergency Organisation arrangements for maintaining essential services in a major dispute. These are in good working order, for there have been repeated threats of strikes for which preparation wasnecessary. The closer Departmental contacts with industry, the Governmenfsregional machinery, the tacit acceptance of the Governmenfs responsibility tosecure the continuity of essential services these make for considerable strength.But of course this acceptance would vanish if any attempt were made to use theGovernmental apparatus (including the use of troops) for any other purpose butthe continuity of services essential to life.   (Part IV.)5. We have considered the effects of strikes for a four-week period, at the worst period of the year. Much depends upon the extent and speed at which a major strike would spread. We have considered various strikes in isolation, but of course account must also be taken of the possibility that they might occursimultaneously and that in some cases deliberate efforts would be made to spreadthem into other industries.  (Part V.)6. There is no doubt that the most paralysing of all strikes would be that ofthe electric power stations. This would lead immediately to a crippling of industry(and much besides). Fortunately, such a strike has not happened for very manyyears, and is not very probable; there is well-developed machinery for negotiation and settling disputes (in which the Electrical Trades Union has only a minorityrepresentation), and there is in addition some restraint in the provisions of the conspiracy and Protection of Property Act of 1875 as extended by the Electricity(Supply) Act, 1919.7. The next most damaging would be a coal strike or a railway strike. these would have similar consequences, for the most vital and indispensable function ofthe railways is to move coal. The stoppage or drastic curtailment of coal supply would gradually lead to substantial interference with industry as stocks wereexhausted. About the end of the second week, industry would begin to run intoserious difficulties, which would extend rapidly jn the third, fourth and subsequentweeks.
8. In a four-week coal strike, the loss is estimated at 1  per cent, of a year&apos;industrial production; but by that time we should expect industrial production tobe no more than about 50 per cent, of normal, and falling. It must be emphasised that the duration is the important point. A two weeks&apos; coal strike or railway strike would not involve serious economic damage; a six weeks&apos; strike would bea formidable blow to the economy.9. The size and distribution of coal stocks is vital in determining the resistingpower of the economy. But any attempt to build up more stocks, as a matter of long-term policy, would present practical and financial problems and might well be frustrated by the miners.10. A dock strike would be less serious in its initial industrial effects (unless it interrupted searborne coal for power stations), for industry is normally wellstocked with raw material. The most serious effect would be on the food supply,particularly wheat and sugar; this might lead to shortages after two or three weeks.Effects throughout the whole economy would begin to become serious after, say,three weeks.11. As distinct from these strikes in the key sectors, we have also consideredthe effect of a four-week strike in engineering industries employing nearly4 million people and representing about one-third of industrial production. Therewould be an immediate and substantial loss of industrial production and exports.But the rate of loss would not grow fast.  (Part VI.)12. Thus, a fortnight&apos;s engineering strike would be much more damaging tothe national economy than a fortnight&apos;s strike in coal or railways (the main effectof which would fall upon the convenience of the public rather than the economic structure). The damage in the second fortnight might be about equal in the two cases. In the third fortnight, the damage of the coal or railway strike would bemuch greater than that of the engineering strike.  (Part VII.)13! These are rough-and-ready illustrations, but they show the point. Itmust be added, however, that the economic damage even of a prolonged strike inan important range of industries such as engineering is not necessarily as great asthe damage to the national economy from an excessive wage concession assuming (what cannot be certain) that this could be moderated by resistance. Thescale of damage to the national economy from stoppages outside the key services isvery often overestimated and the long-term damage from a costly settlementunderestimated.14. It is difficult to illustrate the point quantitatively, but our crude estimates of loss of output in a four weeks&apos; strike in no case (except electric power) amountto more than 3 per cent, of a year&apos;s industrial production a loss equivalent tothe sacrifice of a year&apos;s normal expansion of production. Account must also betaken of the probability that some of the loss would be made good by harder workafter the end of a strike.15. A major strike would.be likely to lose us exports and so damage thecurrent balance of payments, but the damage might be less than that caused by alarge wage increase. In terms of foreign confidence in sterling, a strike mightsimilarly be less damaging than a large wage increase: indeed, if it were seen tobe a result of Government determination to resist inflationary wage settlements itmight improve confidence.16. It must be remembered that the scope of action by the Government inthis whole field is limited. There is a tendency to overlook the fact that the vast majority of wage settlements are achieved peacefully without any question ofGovernment intervention; and that resistance to inflationary wage demands in onesector of the economy does not necessarily affect the attitude of employers inother sectors.
REPORT ON INDUSTRIAL DISPUTESI. introduction. This report, prepared by officials of the Treasury, the Home Office, theBoard of Trade, the Ministry of Labour and National Service, the Ministry of power, the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation and the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food, attempts to assess the main probable effects onthe national economy of major strikes, particularly in the transport and powerindustries. We deal principally with the effects that might be produced by strikeswithin the next twelve months or so; but a good many of the points we discusswould also be relevant over a longer period.2. It is necessary to distinguish between three types of effect. In the firstplace, a strike is likely to cause immediate inconvenience to the public and reducedcurrent consumption e.g., during the railway strike of 1955 many people spentlonger than usual in travelling to and from work, and accordingly had less leisuretime; in the printing strike of 1956 people could not buy certain newspapers and periodicals. We have not regarded it as part of our task to examine ways and means of minimising this kind of inconvenience, generally speaking; from some points of view, indeed, it ought not to be minimised, for it is very desirable thatthe public should fully realise that strikes are bound to have unpleasant and damaging effects. Secondly, there may be interruption of supplies and services essential to the life, health or safety of the community: we describe in Part IV ofthis report the organisation which exists to deal with this. Really severe short-termhardship (e.g., in the case of a serious shortage of domestic coal) may be in this category, i.e., may have to be regarded as a threat to the health of the communityrather than as a mere inconvenience. Thirdly, there may be more far-reachingdamage to the economy by way of adverse movements in the balance of payments(e.g., by interference with our export trade), adverse effects on confidence in sterling(not necessarily justified by the ultimate balance of payments effects), delays in investment, and inflationary pressure.3. We have studied from this point of view, in Part V of this report, theprobable consequences of strikes in the coal mines, inland transport, the docks and the power stations respectively. These, obviously are the key sectors in this context: * stoppages in these services threaten the whole economy. They coverabout 8 per cent, of the employed population, or about If million workers. Theyare mainly in public ownership and commercial pressures are not necessarily thedetermining factor in their wage negotiations: and the Government can exercisemore influence over their ability and willingness to face increased wage costs thanit can in the case of private industry. Thus they often tend to act, or areaccused of acting, as bellwethers to private industry in wages. This, however, isnot invariably the case, for earnings comparisons between these sectors and manufacturing and constructional industry generally over the last seven yearsshow that, for adult males in particular, their increases have fallen somewhat belowthe general average:  Changes in Earnings in Certain Industries between April, 1949 and October, 1956All WorkersAdult MalesAll manufacturing and con-structional industries   ...Coalmining ...British RailwaysroadGoods transport by(excluding B.R.S.)Tramway and omnibus ser-vices (excluding london transport)Dock labour        ......Electricity supply......Per cent.

4. Strikes outside these sectors may be expected, generally speaking, to beless damaging to the economy. In Part VI we consider the consequences of strikes outside the key sectors, taking the engineering industry as an example.5.   Effects on the national economy will naturally vary considerably vaccording to the length of a strike and the time of year at which it takes place. Forsimplicity, we have assumed in each case a four-week strike at the worst possibletime of year. In the coal and electricity industries this means the month ofMarch, i.e., the end of the winter when coal stocks are at their lowest, and forthe railways we have taken March also, since, as we shall show, the mostimportant single effect of a railway strike is its interference with the movementof coal. In the case of the docks, we have assumed September, since theirseasonal trade tends to be highest around that time. In Part VI we have assumed that effects would not vary significantly according to the time of year.II. Recent Experience and ComparisonsNo. of	Aggregateworkers	workinginvolved	days lost26,000	230,0001,072,600	1,072,6009,000	239,0008,700	485,50026,500	530,20077,300	467,00070,000	865,00021,300	673,0007,100	233,40016,000	370,000165,000	2,150,000615,000	4,000,0006. In general, since the war, strikes have been more frequent than in theinter-war years, but they have been shorter. The only major stoppages since1951 have been as follows:  Year1951    Docks     .........1953   *Engineering       ............1953    Motor car manufacturing      ......1954    Ship-repairing    .............1954    Docks     ...............1955    Coalmining............1955   *Railways...............1955    Docks     ............1955    Aero-engine manufacturing    ......1956   *Printing...............1957 *Shipbuilding and ship-repairing1957   *Engineering       ............(Those asterisked arose out of wage disputes, the others out of disputes on other matters.)It will be noted that the recent shipbuilding and engineering strikes resulted in far greater aggregate numbers of working days lost than any other strikes since 1951.7. The big strikes listed in the preceding paragraph, however, represent only about half the time lost by industrial disputes in the period in question. As muchagain was lost by small strikes to which individually it would have been neitherpossible nor desirable for the Government to devote any special attention. Thegreat majority of those small strikes were the short stoppages endemic in the coal-mining industry.8. Even including the small strikes, the annual average loss of working days in the years 1946-56 was only 2-2 million (or 0-04 per cent, of total working time)compared with 3-5 million in 1929-39 and with 20-5 million in 1919-29(excluding 1926, when the total loss was 162 million). It will be seen from paragraph 6 that the 1957 figure is already well above the 1946-56 average.However, disputes during the last five years have caused the loss of less than3 per cent, of the working time lost by unemployment and less than 1 per cent,of the time lost by sickness. We think these comparisons put the problem in a useful perspective.9. Appendix I contains a comparative statement showing the working timelost through disputes per thousand persons employed in mining, manufacturing,construction and transport in various countries. Of our more importantcompetitors, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands have had smaller losses onthis account than we have had in recent years; in the United States, on the otherhand, the relative loss of working time has been several times as great as in thiscountry, and in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France and Japan it has also been,substantially greater.10. Although our actual losses of working time through strikes in recentyears have been very small, we must point out at this stage that a major strike
of the type discussed in Parts V and VI of this report would cause a far greaterloss. A four-week strike in coal mining, for instance, would represent about 15million working days.III. Factors Likely to Influence the Development and Extension of strikes at the Present Time11. We must note the strengthening of the trade unions in the last twenty years. There are now nearly 10 million trade union members, compared with^ million in 1926, of whom 1^ million took part in the general strike. The powerof the trade unions is more concentrated than it used to be; six big unions havebetween them 4^- million members. National organisation has increased and national agreements are more common; supervisory and non-manual workers are better organised than they used to be. All this would make it possible for thestrike weapon to be used more effectively and quickly, backed by bigger member-ships and by more powerful political and propaganda apparatus. It has not in fact been so used to any great extent in recent years, because it has not been necessaryto do so.12. The attitude of mind of the individual worker towards strike actionmerits consideration. Full employment might be supposed to tend towards greaterreadiness to strike, but there are many factors tending in the other direction.Although the worker is to some extent now cushioned by income tax rebates and national Assistance Board support for his family, the difference between regular weekly earnings and strike pay is much greater than it was before the war.Workers accustomed to a high standard of living and heavily involved in hire purchase commitments are much more reluctant to face a sharp loss of incomethan in the past. The importance of individual inclinations should not, however,be overestimated. In the last resort, trade union executives will decide to call astrike if they consider there is a sufficiently important issue of principle at stake,and the social and industrial penalties of blacklegging are so great that when anofficial strike is called the individual worker has little alternative but to obey,even if his loyalty to the union is not in itself sufficient.13. The financial situation of the trade unions has also some relevance andthis may be a factor tending towards a larger number of shorter and less costlystrikes. Appendix II shows the memberships, total general (excluding political)funds and dispute benefits of the six largest unions in the industries concerned.The effect on union funds of a national official strike depends on the industry andtype of union involved; e.g., in the case of a dock strike, the T. &amp; G.W.U., being a general union, would have only a relatively small proportion of its membershipinvolved, whilst a railway or coal strike would involve the whole of the N.U.R.or N.U.M. Where only a proportion of the membership is on strike special leviesmay be made on those remaining at work to help the strikers. The levy capacityof the members is probably of greater importance than the immediate size of union funds, and while full employment continues the unions have, in the ability of their members to pay a special levy, a far greater financial reserve than theyhave ever enjoyed before. An interesting recent example of the effect of a large-scale strike on union funds is that of A.S.L.E.F. in 1955. During that year theSociety paid  329,000 as dispute benefit, and at the end of the year it owed 318,000 on bank overdraft. But the possibility that militancy may pay dividendsis demonstrated by the fact that during 1955 the total membership of A.S.L.E.F.increased by 4,400, whilst that of the N.U.R. decreased by 4,000.14. Total union funds are higher than they have ever been, but it does notnecessarily follow that the unions could sustain any prolonged drain on them.Increases in their working expenses, although considerably less than the general increase in the cost of living, have nevertheless well exceeded the increase in contributions per member. The unions are not so well equipped financially to sustain large-scale and protracted strikes as is generally supposed. The financial aspect is not, however, necessarily decisive, and where a dispute gives rise to strong feelings caution may well be thrown to the winds or a policy of militancy at all costs may override financial prudence. E.g., the E.T.U., which is known to be in serious financial trouble, was foremost in urging the continuance of the recentengineering and shipbuilding strikes.   On the other hand, the A.E.U. and
N.U.G.M.W., both better off financially, were largely responsible for calling offthe strikes, and it is believed that financial considerations were partly responsiblefor their attitude.15. The ways in which a strike, once begun, may spread to other workers are considered where possible in the sections of this report dealing with strikes in particular industries, but some general comments may be made here.Sympathetic strikes are not, broadly speaking, illegal: a note on the legal positionis contained in Appendix III. In general, the likelihood of sympathetic action by trade unions not directly involved in a dispute is impossible to assess in advance,but clearly it is most likely where the matter at issue arouses sympathy of other unions to a pronounced degree, or involves a principle regarded as vitally affectingthe interests of the trade union movement. These circumstances do not necessarilyarise from a wages claim but may emerge from disputes over non-unionism,redundancy and the like. The use of troops to replace essential workers on strikemay be liable to provoke a sympathetic stoppage, though it has not often done so in recent years.16. An uncertain factor in the spread of any major industrial dispute at thepresent time is the attitude of the T. &amp; G.W.U., under the Secretaryship of Mr.F. Cousins. This union has ramifications extending through a very wide range ofindustries including docks, road transport, civil aviation, gas, electricity and water.A threat to use this widespread power to reinforce a particular strike action wasmade in the recent Briggs and engineering and shipbuilding disputes, and was actually put into effect last year, on a limited scale, in the British Motor Corporationstrike, when buses serving some of the firm&apos;s works were stopped and theCorporation^ products &quot; blacked &quot; at the docks. Whether this technique could be successfully employed to a greater extent, or whether more serious threats of this nature would prove to be empty ones, is by no means certain at present; but thetendency is disturbing.17. So far as negotiating processes are concerned, there is no specialprobability at the present time that a strike in a particular key industry will inevitably develop into a general strike. Each industry has its own separatenegotiating machinery which operates completely independently. negotiations in respect of road transport employees of individual manufacturing and tradingcompanies (&quot; C &quot; licence holders) are normally carried on within the separateindustries or trades concerned. However, while we have considered each of ourselected strikes in isolation, it must of course be borne in mind that more thanone might occur simultaneously, and that in some cases deliberate efforts would bemade by the trade unions to spread the stoppage to other industries.IV. Existing Government Machinery for Dealing With Effects of StrikesThe Emergencies Organisation18. There is in existence an Emergencies Organisation, created to co-ordinateGovernment action in any civil emergency which threatens supplies or services essential to the life of the Community. The Organisation consists of a ministerial committee under the Chairmanship. of the Home Secretary, a Central Inter-departmental Official Committee under the Chairmanship of the Permanent Under-Secretary of State, Home Office and Regional Committees.19. The Official Committee and the Regional Committees are deliberativeand co-ordinating bodies, and responsibility for taking positive action falls upon theDepartment which would normally take that action or have responsibility for the sector, industry or service affected.20. The Official Committee advises Ministers whether the powers conferred by the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, should be exercised. This Act provides forthe making of regulations which &quot; may confer or impose on a Secretary of State orother Government Department or on any persons in Her Majesty&apos;s service or acting on Her Majesty&apos;s behalf such powers and duties as Her Majesty may deem necessary for the preservation of the peace, for securing and regulating the supplyand distribution of food, water, fuel, light and other necessities, for maintaining themeans of transit or locomotion, and for any other purposes essential to the public
safety and the life of the community.&quot; The Act specifically prohibits the making of any regulations imposing any form of compulsory military service or industrialconscription.21. An emergency has been declared on the following occasions since thewar:--1948 London Dock Strike.Proclamation of emergency, but no regulations made because of suddenend of strike.1949 London Dock Strike.Proclamation of emergency and regulations made.1955 National (A.S.L.E.F.) Railway Strike.Proclamation of emergency and regulations made.So far as possible, however, action is taken without recourse to emergency powers.In the years immediately after 1945, use was made of powers conferred by&quot;war-timeDefence Regulations and continued in force under the Supplies and Services Acts,but as these powers have lapsed one by one it has been necessary to increase thescope of the regulations made when the powers conferred by the 1920 Act havebeen invoked. The precise regulations needed in an individual case depend uponthe circumstances, but there would normally be little difficulty in adding to andadapting previous sets of regulations to meet the requirements of a new situation.22. For the use of troops in maintaining essential supplies and services,reliance is normally placed on Regulation 6 of the Defence (Armed Forces)Regulations, which provides that a command given by a superior officer in relationto work approved by the Service authorities as being urgent work of national importance shall be a lawful command. If this regulation were to lapse and notbe replaced by permanent legislation proposals for which are now before theEmergency Legislation (Ministerial) Committee the Emergency Powers Act wouldhave to be invoked whenever it was desired to use troops on the maintenance of essential supplies and services in any industrial dispute, so as to avoid any questionof the lawfulness of this action.23. The Emergencies Organisation has proved a valuable focus of consultation and co-ordination of Government action in the strikes affecting essential supplies and services which have occurred in recent years. The Official Committee has met frequently and an extremely useful fund of experience has been accumulated.The regional machinery of the Departments, and the departmental contacts with industry, now much closer than they were before the war, also contribute to thestrength of an organisation which is now, so far as can be judged, substantially more efficient than was the corresponding administrative mechanism in 1926.Public opinion nowadays, moreover, is on the whole readier than it used to be toaccept as a matter of course that the Government must take steps of this nature tosecure the continuity of essential services. Even the trade unions have not reactedstrongly against such action, though it must be borne in mind that the experienceof the use of troops since the war has been almost entirely confined to strikes whichwere not officially supported by the unions and. with two exceptions only, tookplace while a Labour Government was in office.24. The main positive contribution of the Organisation has been in providingfor the supply of troops to do essential work.The following is a list of the occasions on which troops have been so usedsince the war:  1947 Glasgow and London Dock Strikes.Troops unloaded perishable foodstuffs from ships.1947 Smithfield Lorry Drivers Strike.Troops carried meat from market to wholesalers&apos; vehicles.1948 London Dock Strike.Troops unloaded perishable foodstuffs from ships.1949 London and Avonmouth Dock Strike.Troops unloaded perishable foodstuffs from ships.
1949 London Electricity Strike.Troops kept power stations going.1950 London Dock Strike.Unloading.1950 Smithfield.Unloading.1950 London Gas Strike.Troops did stoking and labouring work at gasworks.1953 London Oil Tanker Drivers Strike.Troops delivered oil and petrol to retailers.1955 Railway Strike.Troops carried mails on trunk routes for G.P.O.However, both in numbers and in experience the available troops fall far short ofwhat would be needed wholly to replace strikers engaged on essential services inthe case of a major dispute. The number of men who could be made availablevaries greatly according to the disposition of the Armed Forces: without priorwarning, it is seldom possible to produce more than a few thousand troops, andeven these require about 72 hours for their deployment, though thereafter there canbe a steady build-up. In the next twelve months it is not likely that more than about 100,000 men could be made available even in a grave emergency; the services could also provide about 7,000 lorries with regular drivers and a further 5,000 lorrieswith, less highly trained drivers. Jobs which troops cannot undertake includethe mining of coal; the maintenance of a normal signalling service on the railways(though they could provide a few train crews); and the replacement of lightermenat the docks.25. Arrangements could be made in an emergency to recruit civilian volunteersthrough the local offices of the Ministry of Labour to replace strikers on essential work, but there has been no recent experience of this, and it is impossible to say what the response would be in any particular situation which might arise.26. It is essential to bear in mind that the Emergencies Organisation operatesin a limited field. It is concerned only with the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the general public: it is not a part of its functions to concern itself with the economic effects of industrial disputes or, for example, with themaintenance of export trade. The general acceptance of the necessity forGovernment action of the kind undertaken by the Organisation, to which we have referred in paragraph 23 above, would certainly disappear if its activities were extended in this way. Moreover, bringing in troops, which as mentioned above is the main step the Organisation can take, is a form of Government action whichmay provoke sympathetic stoppages. The Organisation must be regarded,therefore, as a means of keeping the community alive rather than of safeguardingits prosperity to any degree.Statistics A vailable27. Under the heading of &quot; existing Government machinery &quot; it is alsoconvenient to mention the statistical information that is available about the stocksof various commodities, which is an essential prerequisite both for judging inadvance the probable effects of any particular strikes, and for taking steps to minimise damage to the economy once a strike has begun. Statistics of stocks arecollected for a very long list of commodities, both foodstuffs and industrial materials; most of them are collected monthly (a few of the less important quarterly),but coal stocks are known weekly. Broadly speaking, end-March stock figures are centrally available in the Central Statistical Office by about the end of April,and are published in the Monthly Digest of Statistics, or in its Secret Supplement,in May. The weekly information on coal stocks is available with a ten-day timelag. Most of the stocks are expressed as absolute figures, but it is easy to calculateroughly how many weeks&apos; consumption they represent. No information isregularly collected centrally about the geographical distribution of stocks, but theMinistry of Power has regional figures of coal stocks, and similar information
could readily be obtained in emergency for steel. We do not think it would be worth while to devote manpower and effort to obtaining more information of thiskind for the purposes with which we are concerned.V. Strikes in Key Sectors of the Economy(A).   Coalmining28. The biggest coal strike in recent years was in Yorkshire in 1955; thislost nearly 1 million tons of coal and affected supplies to gas works, coke ovensand the house coal market. The last national coal strike was in 1926, when coal production was reduced by over 100 million tons by a strike lasting some seven months. Over half of this reduction was met by cutting back exports and bunkercoal by 40 million tons and importing in 1926 and 1927 (to build up stocks again)nearly 25 million tons of coal and coke; in terms of current prices, this would represent a cost of about  500 million to the balance of payments. For the rest,consumers generally in the 1920&apos;s had high stocks both of coal and of other goods:there were 5 million tons of coal in stock at collieries at the end of March 1926,gas works had over eight weeks&apos; supply, power stations eight weeks, and therailways five weeks, while industry&apos;s stocks were estimated at over four weeks&apos;supply and merchants&apos; stocks of domestic coal were thought to be between two andthree weeks&apos; supply.29. Coal consumption was maintained at the previous year&apos;s level at gasworks and power stations; there was, however, a shortage of domestic coal duringthe summer and retail prices rose in November to a peak two and a half timesabove the pre-strike level. As regards the effect of the strike on the economy asa whole, total imports fell only slightly compared with 1925, and exports were only 7 per cent. down. Unemployment of insured workers rose from 9 per cent,to \3\ Per cent- Thus the effects were not disastrous. But it has to be borne inmind that in 1926 we had two large cushions which would no longer be big enoughto help us withstand the shock of a national coal strike great flexibility in our overseas coal trading, and very high stocks of coal and other commodities.30. At the present time, a national coal strike does not seem very likely. ANational Conciliation Scheme for the industry was introduced in 1946; under this,comprehensive machinery exists at each level (pit, district and national) for thesettlement of disputes by conciliation or, if that fails, by arbitration, and thenational agreement provides that arbitration awards shall be binding upon theNational Coal Board and upon the National Union of Mineworkers and its members. On at least one issue the Union has hinted that it would not put a claimto arbitration, implying that it would be prepared to go to the length of a national strike if a claim of great importance were not met; and it is also conceivable thatan issue might arise which the Union might claim was not within the scope of theScheme. But generally speaking, the Union seems to attach a great deal ofimportance to the Conciliation Scheme and would probably be reluctant- to actofficially in breach of it.

But generally speaking, the Union seems to attach a great deal ofimportance to the Conciliation Scheme and would probably be reluctant to actofficially in breach of it. It has done its best to limit local unofficial strikes onminor issues.31. It would be possible for a small section of the industry, the winding .engine men, to stop the pits from working altogether; they have in fact done so inthe past, but they are now members of the N.U.M. and less likely to strikeindependently. Another small section, the National Association of CollieryOvermen, Deputies and Shot-firers, is not part of the N.U.M. but has separatenegotiating arrangements, and as it is composed of supervisory workers who arein something of a key position it could by striking produce a serious effect on theindustry for a time at least; but an all-out strike by this association is also unlikely.In any case, in recent stoppages by these sections of the industry miners with suitable qualifications have often been able to take over their jobs successfully and keep production going.32. In the following paragraphs we attempt to assess the effect of ahypothetical national coal strike lasting four weeks in the month of March. (wage negotiations in coalmining, as in industry generally, tend to arrive at a climax inthe autumn and winter months.) The number of working days lost by such a strikecould readily be obtained in emergency for steel. We do not think it would be worth while to devote manpower and effort to obtaining more information of thiskind for the purposes with which we are concerned.
would be about 15 million and the amount of coal production lost would be about16 million tons.33. The use of alternative fuels could be of some help in such a strike,but it must be remembered that coal still provides 85 per cent, of the country&apos;total energy requirements. Oil is the only alternative as a basic fuel, and industry has very little dual-firing equipment. The main alternatives, especially for spaceheating in industry or in the home, would be gas and electricity, and of coursethese industries in turn depend largely on coal. The flexibility in switching fromoil to coal which became evident during the recent oil shortage would not be soeasily achieved in the reverse direction.34. The number of weeks&apos; supply of coal held in stock by consumers would therefore be all-important. The following table shows the stocks held by the maingroups of consumers at the end of February, 1957, and sets them againstrequirements at the rate of consumption which obtained in the last week ofFebruary, 1956: this was a very cold week and therefore represents a high levelof consumption.User Weekly use Stocks(million tons) (weeks)Electricity           .................. 1-2                5-3Gas........................ -7                3-3Coke ovens        ............      ...      ... &quot;6                2-iron and steel     ......&apos;     ......      ...... -1                2-6Engineering        .................. -1                4-other industry    .................. -7                4-0Railways   ......      ............... &quot;25              2-3House coal (merchants&apos; stocks)        ......... -75              1-2*Total       ......... 5-2 3-135.. Within each group, stocks are likely to be lowest near the coalfields andhighest at places remote from the coalfields: stock-holding policy is in generaldirected to the possibility of transport difficulties rather than to that of a coal strike. Most users will be relying on incoming supplies before their stock figuresactually reach zero: for example, in the case of house coal a figure of half a week&apos;sstocks held by merchants really means that most depots are empty.36. The table shows that if this year&apos;s stock experience were repeated thecountry would have, on average, about three weeks&apos; coal in hand. But therewould, of course, be wide variations around this average. Stocks lower than theaverage would include those of the coke ovens and railways, and of house coalmerchants; gas and particularly electricity would have better stocks than theaverage, but their usage would increase substantially in the early weeks of astrike because coal consumers would turn to gas and electricity as far as theycould.37. There would be certain supplies in the pipeline: at any time something like one week&apos;s output is in transit from the pits to users, and all of this would beavailable if the coal strike did not spread to the railways or to road transport.In addition, there might be about 1 million tons of stocks in wagons at collieries,and there would also be ground stocks of small coal at the collieries, although theminers probably would not permit the latter to be lifted unless, as is the case here and there, they were held well away from the pits. In any event the pipeline wouldhave to be re-filled before supplies could be fully restored, so that the use of thesesupplementary supplies would not reduce the total period of shortage so muchas delay its onset.38. Open-cast working could probably continue; this would produce aboutI million tons a week, and 1 million tons might be available from stocks at open-cast sites. Some additional coal imports from abroad might possibly be arrangedquickly; they could not arrive, however, until the third or fourth week of astrike, unless American coal coming to continental markets could be diverted, andeven then dock and transport workers might refuse to handle them. All of thesepossible supplements to supplies taken together could hardly add more than about an extra week to the national stocks and this help might vary considerably in itsincidence as between different parts of the country.39. Shortages of house coal would begin to occur within two weeks and insevere weather they would result in great hardship to families without alternative* The totals quoted in this paragraph relate to all users of coal and not merely to the majorusers listed.
means of heating. Some industries would almost certainly be in difficulties after about two weeks, and among the first to suffer might be the gas industry, thecoke ovens, and the steel industry. (Very little coking coal is produced by open-castworking.) We have considered whether those industries in particular should be encouraged to build up higher coal stocks against the possibility of a strike; asindicated in paragraph 28, they did in fact carry much higher stocks in the 1920&apos;sthan they do now, and it seems clear that any such strategic action taken beforehandwould be most usefully directed to these sectors of the economy. There might,however, be considerable practical difficulties both as regards availability of the types of coal required and as regards the cost of storage; and of course if the minersbecame aware of the nature and purpose of any such stock-building, they mightwell take steps to frustrate it. In any event, the gas and steel industries mightnowadays prefer to meet a coal shortage by greater use of oil and other fuels.40. Arrangements would have to be made to alter the normal pattern of distribution so as to safeguard the stocks of the more important and/or vulnerableconsumers. There are limits to what can be done in this direction, because manyconsumers can use only a narrowly defined type of coal, but some priority would be needed for such consumers as industries operating continuous processes,hospitals, &amp;c. The detailed arrangements would best be operated by the national coal Board, but guidance as to priorities would have to be given on theGovernment^ responsibility. Some thought was given to this in 1954 and 1955 inthe anticipation that a railway strike might involve serious interference with coal supplies, and it was clear that there would be extremely difficult problems. Cutsin the supplies of house coal would be peculiarly difficult: it is the poorestsections of the community in general who are most dependent on coal, and leastable to switch to other fuels such as gas and electricity. As regards industry, the basic industries on which all the others depend are the heaviest users of coal:it might have to be decided whether their supplies should take precedence over those of the secondary industries, taking into account that the latter, generallyspeaking, use relatively small amounts of coal both in proportion to theemployment they provide and in proportion to their export performance, so thatcuts in their coal supplies would have disproportionate effects in those fields. Inthe winter of 1950-51, when a serious coal shortage was feared, the F.B.I. and theT.U.C. were strongly opposed to a scheme of differential cuts; but it is by nomeans certain that a cut spread evenly over all industrial consumers would be thebest arrangement for the economy as a whole. Similar problems would have arisen in relation to fuel oil had it been necessary to impose greater reductions in fuel oil consumption during the recent Suez crisis, though they would have been less acute than in relation to coal as more consumers are wholly dependent on coal than on fuel oil. It is of interest that the F.B.I. (who initially suggested a15 per cent, cut in fuel oil all round) accepted that should further cuts be necessarythey would have to be discriminatory.41. The loss of industrial production resulting from a coal strike would consist partly in loss of coal output and partly in loss of output by otherindustries. The coal lost is worth about  5 per ton at the pithead, but in calculating the percentage of total industrial production lost on this account itis statistically more accurate to reckon only the net output figure of  3 per tonwhich is normally reckoned as the coal industry&apos;s contribution to total industrial production. On the latter basis the loss in respect of coal output during a four-week strike would be about  50 million; some of this might be made up laterwhen the miners worked harder to make up for lost earnings, but the amount ofoffset cannot be estimated. As regards other industries, on the assumption that output would cease when coal stocks reached the February 1947 level, there mightbe little or no loss of production by the end of the second week of a coal strike,but by the end of the fourth week there might be a loss of about  100 million,and the figure would increase very rapidly thereafter. The total effect of a four-week strike might be a loss of  150 million of industrial production or 1  per cent,of total annual industrial production: this would of course be equivalent to a loss of 18 per cent, of normal industrial production for the month concerned. Ifthe strike continued for another two weeks, the percentage of annual industrial production lost might rise to 3 . The loss of exports from a four-week strikemight be  35 million, or 1 per cent, of our total annual exports, and this loss also would rise very rapidly in later weeks if the strike continued.
42.   The indirect effects would include the following:  (a) Without rationing of gas, which in itself presents an almost insolubleproblem, gas supply would very largely cease after the second week ofa coal strike. On the average, manufacturing industry depends on gasfor about 5 per cent, of its total fuel supplies. Without a very detailed examination of all industrial processes it is impossible to say whatwould be the effect on production of a virtual stoppage of the supplyof gas, or how far industry could take steps to mitigate its effects, but where gas is vital to a particular process (e.g., pottery kilns) it might cause quite disproportionate damage.(b) The industrial customers for steel have, on average, adequate stocks of finished and crude steel, and there should be no widespread indirecteffects on these industries from a stoppage in the iron and steel industrycaused by lack of coal.(c) Railways would probably run out of coal for all but the most vital servicesbefore the end of four weeks, but the effects of this upon manufacturing industry would probably not be very large. The main difficulty mightbe that finished goods might pile up at the end of the production line and cause congestion; and there might be a marked effect upon exportswhere there were not enough goods in the dock warehouses to fill theempty ships, but the long-term effect on the volume of exports from thiscause would certainly be negligible.(d) The other industries mainly affected directly would be the non-metalliferousmining industries (bricks, china, cement, &amp;c), whose output would ceaseon average after two weeks. The main industrial customer for their products is the building and contracting trade. As this industry includes a very large number of small firms many of whom may only have asmall stock of materials, there would probably be some effect upon it,but merchants&apos; stocks would help and it is unlikely that the effect in four weeks would be very large.(e) Coal stocks would be run down to an extent that almost certainly couldnot be made up by increased production during the summer. Therewould therefore be a risk that we should enter upon the following winterwith inadequate stocks, with consequent danger of serious dislocationbefore the end of that winter. Alternatively, there would have to bea substantial increase in coal imports at considerable cost to the balanceof payments.(B).   Railways43. The experience of the 1955 railway strike, which involved only A.S.L.E.F.,throws little light on the conditions which might prevail if there were a complete stoppage of work on the railways. During the three weeks of that strike, the freight tonnage carried by the railways fell from about 15 million to 7 million tons;but with N.U.R. staff available, it was possible to organise trains to carry substantial quantities of commodities which were either well suited to rail transport or vital to the economy. A strike involving both A.S.L.E.F. and the N.U.R., or the N.U.R.alone, which would mean a complete stoppage of the signalling system, &amp;c, wouldbe a very different matter.44. One important feature of the 1955 strike, moreover, was the carriage ofa considerable quantity of coal by road; by the end of the strike, about 300,000 tonsa day, three times the normal amount, were being so carried. We think it reasonable to assume that in any complete railway strike the road transport workers wouldnot strike also, but that a considerable tonnage of goods (including coal) normallycarried by the railways would be refused by the road transport workers.45. We attempt to assess the effects of a hypothetical four-week railway strike in March. As regards passenger transport, there would probably be little damage to the economy, providing that petrol and derv were freely available for public transport and private use. About 16,000 million passenger journeys per annUmare carried out on buses and underground (most of them journeys to and from work) as against 1,000 million per annum by rail; and of course many people get to work without using any public transport. The railways, therefore, carry only avery small proportion of passenger transport to and from work.
46. As regards the movement of goods, the normal carryings on the railwaysduring March would be of the following order:  Million tonsCoal ...      ...      ...      ...      ...Iron ore      ...      ...      ...Materials for the iron and steel industry ...Semi-finished goods        .........Other heavy minerals and merchandise ...In the same period, road transport, functioning normally, would carry about90 million tons of goods of all types, including about 3 million tons of coal frompits and open-cast sites. In terms of ton-miles, however, railways and road transport would be approximately equal 1,800 million ton-miles each.47. The principal effect of a railway strike upon industrial production wouldbe a serious interruption in the movement of coal. The short-term effects of thiswould be on very much the same lines as those indicated in the previous sectionof this report dealing with a coal strike; they would be less serious in so far as some coal would continue to be moved by road and by sea, but in the case of a coal strike, on the other hand, some alleviation would be secured in the early stages by emptying coal in the railway pipeline at the points where it was most needed. The railways themselves would not be consuming coal in a railway strike,which would save about \ million tons a week, but this would help the situationonly if the coal could be freely moved away from the pitheads; otherwise,congestion of storage space at the colleries would eventually lead to the shuttingdown of coal production. Serious difficulties in maintaining coal supplies couldbe expected to arise by about the end of the second week of a railway strike.48. The main effects of a railway strike on the iron and steel industry wouldbe shortage of raw materials and inability to dispose of finished products. steel production might be expected to suffer by the third or fourth week, though thisis difficult to estimate with any certainty because of the many differing methodsof steel production, variations in stocks of coal and raw materials, and variations in the amount of output transported by road.49. As regards food, about 80 per cent, of food and animal foodstuffs movesby road and 20 per cent, by rail, though these proportions vary considerablybetween individual commodities, e.g., 80 per cent, of fish is conveyed by rail, butonly 5 per cent, of bacon and tea. Experience has shown that the food tradesare very resilient and, apart from the initial disclocations and local difficulties,given relaxation of restrictions on &quot; C &quot; licensed vehicles and priority in the useof available road haulage, a reasonably adequate distribution of food, other thanmilk, could be maintained. Milk would be a difficulty. London&apos;s daily normalrequirement in March is some 750-800,000 gallons, of which some 400,000 gallonsis conveyed by rail from South Wales and South-West England, requiring ninetrains per day. The maximum number of road tankers which could be broughtinto operation to replace rail transport without seriously affecting the supply of milk to other parts of the country is limited, and there might be a deficiency ofsome 300,000 gallons in London&apos;s daily requirement. As milk production isnearing its peak in March any dislocation of normal movement would result inconsiderable wastage in production areas.50. If a railway strike spread to road transport, a serious food situation could arise, and indeed a purely road strike could produce great difficulty in this respect.The road transport industry is diversified, however, with many small businesseswhere vehicles may be driven by the owner or members of his family, or bydrivers who are not members of a union, so that it is most unlikely that allmovement of food by road would stop. In the general strike of 1926, the strikersat first attempted to discriminate in the transport of food, but the Governmentrefused to recognise such discrimination, and it appears that it would in any case have been inherently impracticable.51. Oil is largely moved by road tankers, and, on the assumption that the oil companies had advance warning of a railway strike and were able to stock up,and that their employees co-operated, it should be possible to maintain normalsupplies of petrol, paraffin and diesel oil, although there might well be an increased demand for all these fuels. Black oils are carried by rail to a greater extent, andthere might well be difficulties here in the second week.
52. As regards other commodities, it is extremely difficult to make any usefulforecast. In total industry holds enough stocks of raw materials other than coal to be able to withstand a four-week stoppage of transport simply by calling on itsstocks, which on average are enough to last for about six weeks. But this averageconceals great differences between individual factories and there would be a good many that would be in serious difficulty much sooner. A certain amount ofproduction would be stopped by congestion of finished goods which could notbe moved away from the factories. The industries most affected would be thosedealing with bulky goods, e:g., the iron and steel industry as indicated inparagraph 48 above: in their case the effect would begin to be felt after two weeks.53. For these other commodities also, much would depend on the availability of road transport. In theory, if the strike did not spread, and if road transport were not required to carry any additional coal or steel, it could cope with the remainder of the railway&apos;s carryings by an increase of 50 per cent, in output, and the Ministry of Transport. would not regard this as an impossibletarget; but as it assumes the coal and steel difficulties solved, it is of course highlytheoretical. The use of Service transport and drivers would ease the problem;volunteer civilian drivers could also be called for, but the numbers qualified to drive lorries is limited, and there would be very substantial problems of organisation.It is doubtful whether an emergency road transport organisation could be workingefficiently much before the end of the four-week period.54. If road and canal services had to be concentrated on essential food and coal distribution, probably little transport would be left for distributing industrial materials, and they would accumulate in port storage. At some point this storagewould, become choked, and acceptance of further imports would have to be checked. This stage might be developing rapidly at the end of four weeks. Andalthough the imports themselves might be affected, the effect on payments forthem might well be negligible. The final result would depend on how muchindustrial production was irretrievably lost as a result of the internal transportproblems; if, as seems likely, it was small, there would be little net effect on imports in the long run. As regards exports, the reserve of goods awaiting loading forexport at the ports would probably be sufficient to keep up the flow of exportsfor two weeks or so (and with a further two weeks&apos; documentation time-lag,recorded exports would probably not show any effect for a month after the strikebegan). Thereafter exports might fall and in the long run there might be some loss of exports owing to cancellation of orders.55. The loss of industrial production from a railway strike might be slightly less than from a coal strike of the same length, say 1  per cent, of total annualindustrial production as compared with 1+ per cent, for a coal strike (see para-graph 41 above). The loss of general industrial output would be roughly the same,the loss of coal output somewhat less in so far as coal would continue to be moved by other forms of transport. In this case also the rate of loss would increaserapidly if the strike continued beyond four weeks.56. As regards the aftermath of a railway strike, it should be physicallyeasier to make up for the losses and delays suffered than it would be to make upthe production lost in a coal strike. The period of reduced exports might lastless than four weeks if extra efforts were made to get goods to the ports after the resumption of normal rail working. One probable consequence of a railway strike, however, would be that some of the traffic diverted to road transport wouldnot return to the railways after the strike was over, and this would do somepermanent damage to the economic position of the railways.,   (G). . Docks57. There has been no national dock strike for many years, but the effects of a major strike even at London or Liverpool alone would in themselves be sosevere as to create a national emergency; These two ports together handle about one-third of the total trade of the United Kingdom by weight, and about two-thirdsby value. No other ports come anywhere near this traffic volume. The two portstogether employ more than half the country&apos;s dock labour force.58. In October, 1954, when the Port of London was gradually brought toan almost complete standstill and the strike was also fairly widespread on the mersey, both London and Liverpool import traffic dropped to 77 per cent, of
their normal monthly average; exports dropped to 65 per cent, in London and 80per cent, in Liverpool. These reductions were less than might have been expected,but most of the traffic must have been handled at the beginning of the monthbefore the strike developed. In May to July 1955, when there was a partial dockstrike, imports dropped to about 75 per cent.; exports from London dropped to51 per cent, of the normal and from Merseyside to 25 per cent, of the normal the strike being most complete in the Merseyside areas which normally handleexports.59. Of the principal disputes in the docks since 1947, only one related to anational wages issue, and in that case the strike was unofficial protest action after an agreement had been reached through the constitutional machinery by theunion officials. The only official stoppages were those of the comparatively smallStevedores&apos; and Lightermen&apos;s Unions; but there is considerable significance inthe fact that these official strikes by relatively small numbers of men attractedthe support of T. &amp; G.W.U. members, although the T. &amp; G.W.U. itself was opposedto the strike. In the stevedores&apos; &quot; recognition &quot; strike, the paradoxical situationarose that in a dispute which was essentially of an inter-union character as betweenthe N.A.S.D. and the T. &amp; G.W.U. large numbers of T. &amp; G.W.U. men came out on strike in support of the stevedores. This illustrates the situation that in the docksindustry the workers are dock workers first and union members second, and thefollowing quotation from the Leggett Report on Unofficial Stoppages in the london docks is of interest:  &quot; It appears to be incredibly easy to bring dock workers out on strike.We were given repeated instances of men stopping work almost automatically,with little or no idea why they were stopping. In the words of one witness,himself a dock worker, &apos; All that was needed was for a man to go round the docks shouting &quot; All out&quot; and waving the men off the ships and out theywould come.&apos; Many dock workers, themselves firm supporters of constitutional methods and resolutely opposed to the activities of unofficialelements, told us frankly that it was too much to expect of the average dockworker that he should remain at work when his mates were out, irrespective of his opinion of the merits of the dispute.&quot;60. National wages claims within the docks industry are dealt with throughthe National Joint Council for the Port Transport Industry. The council is usuallyable to reach agreement, and where it cannot it has in the past referred the matter to the Ministry of Labour for voluntary arbitration.61. Communist influence in the docks has been a serious factor in some ofthe unofficial strikes in recent years, not so much by way of deliberatelyengineering a stoppage&apos; from its inception as by exploiting issues which have caused comparatively minor disputes until they develop into major stoppages. Asectional stoppage by tally clerks or crane drivers can bring practically the wholeof the dock labour force to a standstill. On the other hand, recent dock strikeshave not spread, extensively beyond the ports, although they have, hadrepercussions on ancillary industries such as road haulage and cold storage.62. We have assumed a hypothetical national dock strike lasting four weeks in September, when seasonal trade, particularly in food, is highest. broadly speaking, such a strike would affect all commodities equally. Coastwisemovements of coal would be affected by a nation-wide dock strike, and imports ofcoal also. Grain elevator teams would be involved in the strike, and grainimports would therefore suffer. A strike confined to the docks would, however,leave oil imports virtually unaffected, since they are normally handled at specialterminals by oil company employees. But there is a risk that the strike wouldspread to T. &amp; G.W.U. oil company employees, as well as to tugmen andlightermen in the Thames Estuary. In this case the distribution of oil fromrefineries would also be affected; how far this would affect supplies to consumerswould depend upon the stock levels in the oil company depots cut off, and theextent to which the companies could bridge into these depots by other means, e.g.,road and rail.63. The value of overseas trade which would be affected by a complete strike in all United Kingdom ports amounts to about  350 million a month for imports, 280 million a month for exports, and  12 million a month for re-exports.Imports, as recorded in the Trade and Navigation Accounts, would be affected firstby a complete dock strike, as the time-lag between physical movement and statistical
recording is less for imports than for exports. Sea-borne imports would almost immediately drop to nil, but imports by air, if not declared &quot; black,&quot; might riseabove their present rate of  6 million a month. During the strike some cargoes,particularly of perishable foodstuffs (mainly fruits and vegetables), would be diverted to other destinations or would not be despatched at all. On resumptionof normal working at the ports, imports would again respond first, because imports would have to be unloaded before exports could be stowed, but because ofdiversions they would not re-attain their normal rate immediately. Probably (onthe assumption that industrial production would not be greatly affected by a four-week dock strike) nearly all the diverted cargoes other than perishables would eventually be delivered, but there would be a final loss which might be put at thetoken value of, say,  20 million (f per cent, of our annual imports). It might take up to six months before imports resumed their normal level.64. Exports, as recorded in the Trade and Navigation Accounts, would notappear to fall as quickly as imports at the beginning of a dock strike because oftime-lags in documentation, so that misleadingly &quot; favourable &quot; trade figures wouldresult. Diversion by air routes, if not &quot; blacked,&quot; might be greater for exportsthan for imports; at present about  8 million a month is exported by air. exports would take longer to recover after the resumption of normal port working, asindicated in the previous paragraph. For perhaps about two months after the endof the strike, therefore, the trade figures would be very unfavourable, with highimports and low exports. Some exports would be lost owing to cancellation oforders and diversion to the home market; this might amount to  20- 30 million.The time required to overtake the hold-up in exports would probably be betweensix and nine months.65. The most serious effect of a dock strike would be on imports of food,particularly wheat and sugar. Distribution of flour would break down before theend of the four-week period, though possibly the dockers might decide to resume the unloading of foodships before that position was reached (or troops might haveto be used for that purpose).66. A dock strike of four weeks would not be likely seriously to reduceindustrial production through a shortage of raw materials, but it would interruptsupplies of coal to a number of important electricity generating stations, and unless these could be made up by other forms of transport these stations might bebrought to a halt by the fourth week, with very serious effects on production insome areas. Production for export might be curtailed owing to a pile-up of finished goods at the docks and factories, and after, say, three weeks the difficultiesin maintaining industrial output would mount rapidly. The loss of industrial production by the end of the fourth week might not exceed about  25 million, butif the strike continued for two weeks more it might rise to, say,  100 million, or1 per cent, of total annual industrial production. It has to be remembered, ofcourse, that a dock strike that promised to be prolonged would affect businessexpectations and decisions, and so have repercussions on the economy perhapsearlier than the statistics would indicate.(D).   Electricity Supply67. There has been no national strike in the electricity supply industry formany years, but the effects that a national stoppage would have are indicated bythe experience of the fuel crisis in the winter of 1947, when unemployment rose toa peak of 1-8 million and it was calculated that the effect on the industrial production for the year was nearly 1^ per cent. The effects of an electricity strike at the present time could be very considerably worse than this, partly becauseindustry is now much more heavily dependent on electricity, and partly becausethe 1947 crisis was foreseen and steps were taken to prepare for it.68. Terms and conditions of employment in the electricity supply industry are settled by a National Joint Industrial Council, on the trade union side of whichthe E.T.U. has only three representatives out of twelve. Mr. Frank Foulkes, theGeneral President of the E.T.U., is the leader of the trade union side and is, ofcourse, a well-known Communist; but he has not shown any disposition to floutthe constitutional procedure of the Joint Council. The constitution of the Councilprovides that where in any case the Council is unable to reach agreement it shall,at the request of the majority of either side, refer the difference to arbitration, and
that any award made is binding upon both sides. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the E.T.U. might seek to strike in isolation, in which event serious location would no doubt be caused in the power stations: the extent of thiswould depend very materially upon the attitude of the other unions, and their readiness to undertake duties normally carried out by members of the E.T.U.69. In recent months the Electrical Power Engineers&apos; Association, theorganisation representing supervisory grades in the power stations, caused seriousapprehension about the maintenance of electricity supply by threatening to workto rule: the threat was averted by conciliation.70. Special provisions apply to strikes by employees in the electricity supply industry under the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, as amended by the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1919 see paragraph 5 of Appendix III.71. Practically all industry is now heavily dependent on electricity for itsmotive power, and it is quite certain that any major interruption of supplies wouldhave a crippling effect on industrial production as well as on essential public services such as water, hospitals, transport or sewage pumping. The industriesmost seriously affected would probably be metal manufacture, all kinds of engineering and coalmining. Most other industries are, of course, to a greater or lesser extent dependent on electricity. However, agriculture, building, glass,chemicals and food processing might be relatively unaffected except for lighting.Some 20 per cent, of industrial electricity is generated privately, and this mightmoderate the effects of a strike. But the workers employed in private generationin general belong to the same unions as those employed by the Central electricity authority and Area Boards, and might strike too.72. The extent to which supplies to non-industrial users could be cut in orderto keep industry going is very limited in areas which are both residential andindustrial. In any event, some non-industrial users (e.g., hospitals and water undertakings) would have to have priority even over industry. It would be possibleto economise by cutting supplies to non-industrial users who have their owncircuits (for instance, London Transport); the railways could be expected to diverttraffic as far as possible from electrified to non-electrified lines. Economies couldaiso be made by cutting voltage and frequency.73. Nevertheless, an electricity strike would have more serious effects than any of the other strikes we have considered. The loss of industrial production ina four-week strike might well be 50 per cent, of the industrial production for thefour weeks in question. And this damage would not build up gradually as in a coal, railway or dock strike, but would occur from the very beginning. In practice,the effects would have to be somewhat moderated, as the strike went on, by theuse of troops; standing arrangements exist for calling in troops as needed, andprobably a proportion of the generating plant could be kept in operation. Someplant, however, would have to be shut down, and the damage to the economy would still be very serious. Supplies to consumers would have to be restricted assoon as possible and enforcement problems would multiply; it is hardlyconceivable that the strike could in fact be allowed to continue for as long as four weeks.VI. Strikes in Other Sectors of the Economy74. To illustrate the effects of a strike outside the key sectors of the economy,we have assumed a four-week engineering strike bringing the engineering tradesto a complete standstill. We have assumed that such a strike would not extend tothe large number of engineers and maintenance engineers in other trades, e.g., inthe power industries and in building and contracting.75. The loss in output from an engineering strike would be something betweenthe gross and the net output of the engineering industries. A proportion of the materials that had not been used up in the course of production during the four weeks of strike would be available for production in the future, so the loss wouldbe smaller than the engineering industries&apos; gross output, but as those industries&quot;suppliers would be bound to cut back production to some extent the loss to the economy as a whole would be bigger than the net output of the engineering industries alone. The immediate export loss would be the gross output of engineering goods for export in the four weeks.
76. The current levels of production per month in the engineering trades,* at current prices, are as follows: -Total Production   MillionsGross output        ......      ...      ...      ...      ...&quot;    600Net output  ............      ......      ...      280ExportsGross output ...     1.........      ...      ...      11077. The net output of the engineering trades is about 40 per cent, of the total output of manufacturing industry; the gross value of exports of engineering goods isabout 40 per cent, of our total exports. Thus, net engineering output for one month is about 3 per cent, of a year&apos;s output of manufacturing industry and amonth&apos;s engineering exports are about 3 per cent, of our total annual exports:these percentages give an order of magnitude for the possible loss that anengineering strike would cause, though it is impossible to estimate precisely. It isnot certain that a strike would succeed in completely shutting down all engineeringestablishments. Moreover after the end of the strike the workers would probablywant to recover some of their lost earnings by working overtime, and this mightcut down the loss by as much as a third.78. The secondary effects upon other industries of an engineering strike arevery difficult to measure. Broadly speaking the engineering trades produce fixed capital goods, durable consumer goods, replacements and intermediates. delay in the production, and therefore in the delivery, of fixed capital goods would have only small immediate effects on other industries, but a stoppage in the productionof spare parts might have immediate effects in scattered areas of industry. It seems likely that these effects would not be very large, because the other industries concerned would have stocks of spare parts, as would the engineering manufacturersthemselves. It is unlikely that the strikers would be able to deny the access of theengineering manufacturers to their own warehouses containing finished goods.Here again, if output in other industries were lost as a result of the strike, theworkers in those industries might try to catch up afterwards and thus reduce theloss.79. While the loss of industrial production in a four-week engineering strikemight be substantial, the rate of loss would not in this case mount so rapidly afterthe end of the fourth week as it would in key sector cases we have considered.VII. Conclusions on the Economic Effects of Strikes80. The following table brings together the rough calculations we have made regarding the possible losses of industrial production resulting from various types of strike. The figures in brackets are percentages of net annual industrial production:  Net Output Lost		Number of					workers	2 weeks	4 weeks	6 weeks			  million	  million	  million.

As regards the other keysectors, the table illustrates the rapidity with which the damage caused by strikesis likely to increase after four weeks.81. External effects. All the strikes described would have some permanenteffect on exports, the extent depending on how far immediate deliveries could be* Covering Orders VI, VII, VIII, and IX of the Standard Industrial Classification. The assump-tion that all these trades would strike simultaneously would be extreme and somewhat unrealistic.
met out of stocks (though this, of course, does not apply to a dock strike), and howquickly the loss in production could be made up afterwards, in relation to thenormal period taken to produce the exports concerned (e.g., a shipbuilding strike of four weeks would not be likely to have much effect on existing orders for shipsdue to take two or three years to build). The effect would probably be in loss ofnew orders rather than in cancellation of existing orders. Imports would also bereduced in the short run either through immobilisation of transport facilities or through reduced demand as a result of lower industrial production; but importsof commodities which are already scarce (e.g., coal and steel) might be increased if the production of those commodities lost in the strike period could not be made up afterwards. The balance of payments would be adversely affected; anelectricity strike, which would very seriously affect it, would probably have to be stopped on other grounds before it reached the point of doing so, but a four-weekengineering strike could also involve a balance of payments loss of perhaps 100 million.82. The main impact of a strike on the current balance of payments, however,would end with the strike or fairly soon afterwards. Continued wage increases which make us uncompetitive would be far more dangerous because they would lose us export markets at least until such time as we managed to becomecompetitive again. A strike is something that ends, but a wage increase is something that continues.83. It is fair to add that the antithesis is not always between a wage increase on the one hand and an unsuccessful strike resulting in no wage increase on theother: a more probable alternative may be a fairly short strike followed byacceptance of a wage increase lower than that which might otherwise have been secured. Each case must be considered on its merits, and the circumstances ofparticular industries at particular times will differ. But there will clearly be caseswhere, in terms of the current balance of payments, a strike will be preferable toa large wage increase. As regards foreign confidence in sterlingj this may well bemore weakened in the longer run by undue nervousness on the part of theGovernment and by wage settlements which appear clearly inflationary than bya strike which is faced by the country and the Government calmly and withoutpanic: indeed, if a strike were seen to be the result of a determination to resistinflationary wage tendencies it might improve confidence rather than damage it.84. Internal effects. As regards effects on the balance of home supply and demand, the danger is that output might be reduced by more than money incomes,causing a rise in prices. This danger probably need not be taken very seriously.Even 50 per cent, of the month&apos;s industrial production permanently lost meansonly about 2 per cent, of the gross national product; our rough estimates of theloss of output from four-week strikes in coal, railways, docks and engineering eachamount to about 1 per cent, of the gross national product. It is unrealistic to suppose that there would be an inflationary scramble for reduced supplies, though there might well be a temporary sharp increase in the price of some foodstuffs, atany rate locally. There would be some reduction in personal incomes as a resultof short-time working and laying off, and the existence of hire-purchasecommitments might reduce demand more than proportionately. Only one-quarterof consumers&apos; expenditure is on manufactured goods, and there are large stocks ofthese, so that strikes interfering with manufacturing output would not causeinflationary pressure. The other components of home demand (government expenditure and investment) would not build up as a result of temporaryinterruption of supplies. Thus the long-term effects on the internal economy of even a serious strike need not be very large: less would be produced during theperiod, but demand would also fall.85. A more serious effect would be immediate hardship: this indeed mightbe the economic effect which the country would be least able to bear. There mightbe substantial unemployment over a short period, though it probably would not last long. Most serious in this context might perhaps be the interruption ofsupplies of coal and power. Not only might absolutely essential services (such ashospitals) have to be suspended, but the hardship, especially to the very old andthe very young, of living without warmth or light at the coldest time of the yearmight be intolerable. This, indeed, may be the limiting factor in deciding whether in &quot;any practical sense strikes in these key sectors could be &quot; borne&quot; by thecommunity.

There has been a gradual decline in the emphasis placed by the unions on provident benefits since the First World War, owing largely to the growth of national insurance and pensions. The present expenditure of the unions onsuch benefits varies widely but, nevertheless, in some cases remains a substantial commitment;e.g., in 1955 the T. &amp; G.W.U. spent 3s. lOd. per member on sickness, death and superannuationbenefits, the N.U.M. 3s. Id. and the A.E.U. 24s. 2d.(2) The assets of which the funds are composed may not be readily realisable. It was estimated in1950 that 24 per cent, of the assets of all unions was held as cash and bank deposits, 50 per cent,in British Government securities and over 10 per cent, in British municipal securities. Asinvestment in Government securities tended to take place on a large scale during and justafter the end of the war, the unions would be faced with the prospect of heavy losses if the need arose for any large-scale realisation of these securities.(3) Depreciation may not have been fully provided for.(4) The figures do not take account of expenditure on dispute benefit during the recent ship-building and engineering strikes, which is reported in some instances to have been substantial.
APPENDIX IIINote on the Legal Position of Sympathetic Strikes1. Section 5 (3) of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, provides that in that Actand in the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, the expression &quot; trade dispute&quot; means any dispute between employers and workmen, or betweenworkmen and workmen, which is connected with the employment or non-employment or the terms of the employment, or with the conditions of labour,of any person, and that the expression &quot; workmen &quot; means all persons employedin trade or industry, whether or not in the employment of the employer with whom a trade dispute arises.2. The effect of the words that are italicised is that the protection of theundermentioned provisions in the Acts of 1875 and 1906 is not restricted to strikesarising out of trade disputes between an employer and his own workmen. Thatprotection will also extend to cases where, there being a trade dispute betweenemployer A and his own workmen, other workmen who have no quarrel withtheir own employers and no direct quarrel with employer A, join in the. dispute in sympathy. It may be, for example, that these other workmen consider thattheir own interests are threatened and that they strike against their own employer to bring pressure upon employer A in order to force him to observe standard orrecognised terms and conditions or to employ union labour.3. Provided that a strike, whether direct or merely sympathetic, was in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, those concerned or taking part inthe strike would be entitled to the protection of the following statutory provisions:  (a) section 3 of the Act of 1875, which provides that an agreement orcombination by two or more persons to do or procure to be done any act in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute shall not beindictable as a conspiracy if such act committed by one person wouldnot be punishable as a crime;(b) the provision, added to the said section 3 of the Act of 1875 by section 1of the Act of 1906, that an act done in pursuance of an agreement orcombination by two or more persons shall, if done in contemplation orfurtherance of a trade dispute, not be actionable unless the act, if done without any such agreement or combination, would be actionable;(c) section 2 (1) of the Act of 1906, which provides that it shall be lawful forone or more persons, acting on their own behalf or on behalf of a trade union or of an individual employer or firm in contemplation orfurtherance of a trade dispute, to attend at or near a house or place where a person resides or works or carries on business or happens to be,if they so attend merely for the purpose of peacefully obtaining orcommunicating information, or of peacefully persuading any person towork or abstain from working; and(d) section 3 of the Act of 1906, which provides that an act done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute shall not be actionableon the ground only that it induces some other person to break a contract of employment or that it is an interference with the trade, business, or employment of some other person, or with the right of some other person to dispose of his capital or his labour as he wills. [But an individualworker who took part in a strike, whether direct or merely sympathetic,would be liable to his employer in damages if his action involved a breach of his contract of employment.]4. It will be observed that the above-mentioned statutory protection extend to acts done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute. &quot; If, however,some meddler sought to use the trade dispute as a cloak beneath which to interferewith impunity in other people&apos;s work or business, the jury would be entirely justifiedin saying that what he did was done in contemplation or in furtherance, not of thetrade dispute, but of his own designs, sectarian, political, or purely mischievous,as the case might be &quot; (per Lord Loreburn, L.C., in Conway v. Wade [1909] A.C.at p. 512).
5. Section 4 of the Act of 1875, as extended by section 31 of the Electricity(Supply) Act, 1919, provides that a person employed in a gas or electricity or watersupply undertaking who wilfully and maliciously breaks his contract knowing thathis action, either alone or in combination with others, will deprive the consumerseither wholly or to a great extent of their supply is liable to a fine not exceeding  20or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months.6. Section 5 of the Act of 1875 contains the further provision that a personwilfully and maliciously breaking a contract of service knowing that the probableconsequences of so doing, either alone or in combination with others, will be to endanger human life or cause serious bodily injury, or expose valuable property to destruction or serious injury, is liable to a fine not exceeding  20 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months.
