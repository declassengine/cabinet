(47) 78StA March, 1947CABINETPARLIAMENTARY PROCEDUREMemorandum by the Lord Privy SealIT will be necessary before long to give the House an indication of our attitude to the Third Report of the Select Committee on Procedure, which was presented on 31st October. 1946 * The Report was first examined by the Machineryof Government (Parliamentary Procedure) Sub-Committee under the chairman-ship of the Solicitor-General; their report, which is reproduced as Annex IIto this memorandum, has, at the Prime Ministers request, been considered by aCommittee under my chairmanship, consisting of the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Home Secretary, the Solicitor-General and the Chief Whip.2. The Sub-Committee dealt in their report both with the positiverecommendations of the Select Committee (Part I of Annex II). and with certain proposals put forward on behalf of the Government, which were rejected by theSelect Committee (Part II of Annex II). The recommendations of the Sub-Committee on both groups of proposals are summarised in paragraph 42 of annex II.   The most important matters dealt with are : (a) Reorganisation of Supply Procedure (paragraphs 5-11).(&amp;) Inquiry into Delegated Legislation (paragraphs 12-14).(c) Public Expenditure Committee (paragraphs 15-19).(a) Private Members&apos; Time (paragraphs 20-23).(e) Formalisation   of   the   Report   Stage   of   the   Budget   Resolutions(paragraphs 26-29).3. We agree with the Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendations, subject to thefollowing : (a) Though the proposal for a Public Expenditure Committee should be rejected (paragraph 19 of Annex II). we think that all possible steps should be taken to improve the effectiveness of the existing Committees,especially the Estimates Committee. We understand that the treasury are alive to the need for helping these Committees, and suggest that reference be made to this in any statement rejecting the SelectCommittee&apos;s proposal.(b) While we are in favour of accepting the Select Committee&apos;s proposalfor making up time spent on adjournment motions under standing order No. 8 (paragraph 25 of Annex IT), we think that there mightwell be a similar provision for making up time spent on opposed private business introduced by the Chairman of Ways and Means at 7 o&apos;clockunder Standing Order No. 6. The point may well be taken in debate and we suggest that if it is. the Government spokesman should beauthorised to accept it in principle.(c) We are strongly in favour of the proposal to abolish the present restric-tions on the power of the Chairman of Ways and Means and the deputy Chairman to accept the closure (paragraphs 34 and 35 of* H.C. 189: full version with Minutes of Evidence, H.C. 189-1.[33270] . s
Annex II). Since these officers now have power to accept the closurein Committee, and in the House when the Speaker&apos;s unavoidableabsence has been announced, we see no force in the Select Committeescontention that to enable them to do so on other occasions would blurthe distinction between them and the Speaker. While, therefore, we agree that the Speaker should be consulted, we think that unless hehas very strong views against the proposal, it should be put to theHouse.Id) We understand that it would be difficult to find time to debate the SelectCommittee&apos;s report before Easter, and that in the circumstances theChancellor does not wish to press the suggestion, referred to in para-graph 43 of Annex II, that the new Budget procedure should be inoperation by then. This being so, we think that the best course wouldbe to arrange the debate later in the Session, with a view to bringingall the changes into operation at the beginning of the next Session.4. We think that the most convenient way of announcing the governments intentions would be in answer to a Parliamentary Question. Sir Robert Young,the Chairman of the Select Committee, who has for some time been pressing fora statement, has put down a question for answer on Monday, 17th March. If theCabinet approve the proposals summarised above I will arrange to reply on thelines of the draft set out in Annex I.A. G.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1,Sth March, 1947.
s.1..ANNEX draft AnnouncementQ-Sir Robert Young: To ask the Prime Minister whether the last Report of theSelect Committee on Parliamentary Procedure has been considered; andwhen a statement regarding its recommendations will be made.   (For oralanswer on Monday, 17th March.)A. The Government have given careful consideration to the Report, forwhich the House is much indebted to the Chairman and members of the SelectCommittee.  The Government are in general agreement, subject to certain modifi-cations, with the recommendations of the Select Committee for the reorganisation of Supply procedure; they are favourably disposed to the new scheme for private members&apos; time, for use when such time can be restored, and they accept theproposal for making up time spent on adjournment motions under Standing-Order No. 8.   The Government have also reviewed, in the light of the Report,the suggestions which they themselves submitted to the Select Committee andhave decided to put to the House four of these, of which the most important isthe formalisation of the Report Stage of the Budget Resolutions.It is the Governments intention to afford time for a debate on the SelectCommittee&apos;s Report before the end of this Session, so that those changes in procedure which are acceptable to the House may be brought into operation atthe beginning of next Session.With the Hon. Membets permission, I will circulate in the Official reports detailed statement of the Governments conclusions.Draft Statement for the Official ReportIn their Third Report (H.C. 189, presented on 31st October, 1946), the SelectCommittee made five main recommendations, and considered, but did not accept,seven suggestions by the Government. The Governments views on these are summarised below.Recommendations of the Select Committee(1) Reorganisation of Supply Procedure. The Government agree with theSelect Committee&apos;s proposal, except that they consider that there should be 26allotted days instead of 28, and that there should be no limitation on the numberof occasions when debate may arise on the motion : &apos;&apos; That Mr. Speaker do nowleave the Chair.&quot;(2) Inquiry into Delegated Legislation. The Government consider that suchan inquiry would be premature, so long as the scope and form of subordinate legislation is influenced by war-time powers, and until experience has been gained of the working of the Statutory Instruments Act, 1946.(3) Public Expenditure Committee. The Government are opposed to thisproposal, since they hold that the Public Accounts Committee and the estimates committee have distinct functions which would be confused by amalgamation.The Government will continue to give the utmost possible help to both Com-mittees to enable them to be effective instruments of the House.(4) Private Members&apos; Time: When private Members&apos; time can be restored,the Government would favour the introduction of a scheme on the lines proposedby the Select Committee.(5) Adjournment Motions under Standing Order No. 8. The government agree with the Select Committee&apos;s proposal.Government Proposals Rejected, by the Select CommitteeHaving considered the Select Committee&apos;s objections, the Government pro-pose to drop three of their proposals, but to put the following to the House : (1) In Committee of Ways and Means on the Budget Resolutions, all theresolutions except one should be taken immediately after the Chancellors budget speech, the Committee dividing if necessary, and on the Report Stage, the ques-tion should be put without amendment or debate.
(2) The Chairman of &quot;Ways and Means and the Deputy Chairman shouldhave power to accept the closure whenever either of them is sitting as DeputySpeaker, and not, as&quot;at present, only when the unavoidable absence of Mr. Speakerhas previously been announced.(3) There should be a Committee of the House, consisting of the membersof the Chairmen&apos;s panel and five other members nominated by Mr. Speaker, withthe &quot;function of sub-dividing the time allocated, by guillotine resolution or vohm-tary agreement, to the Committee Stage of any Bill taken on the floor of the House,or to the Eeport Stage of any Bill.(4) In any proceedings in Committee, the Chairman should have power todisallow debate on the question : &quot; That the Clause stand part,&quot; if he is ofopinion that the principle of the Clause, and all substantial points arising thereon,have been adequately discussed oh amendments.
5in(M.G. (P) (47) 4, 24^ February, 1947)ANNEX ii report BY THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT (PARLIAMEN-TARY PROCEDURE) SUB-COMMITTEEIntroduction1. At the request of the Lord President of the Council, we have consideredthe Third Report^ of the Select Committee on Parliamentary Procedure, and now submit the following comments, together with our recommendations on theattitude to be adopted by the Government. At the time of the Lord Presidentsrequest, our Chairman,&apos;the Attorney-General, was in the United States; ourproceedings have, therefore, been conducted under the Chairmanship of the solicitor-General, whom we have authorised to sign this report on our behalf.2. The Select Committee were appointed in August 1945, on the motion of the Government, &apos;&apos; to consider the Procedure in the Public Business of this house, and to report what alterations, if any, are desirable for the more efficientdespatch of such business.&quot; In accordance with their instructions, the Committeefirst reported on proposals submitted to them by the Government for the acceleration-tion of proceedings on public bills. In the course of this inquiry they invited the Clerk of the House to prepare a comprehensive scheme for the reform ofparliamentary procedure; and the memorandum! which Sir Gilbert Campionsubmitted as a result of this request formed the starting point for their subsequentinquiry and is the main basis of their Third Report.3. Sir G. Campion&apos;s memorandum, which contained nine major proposalsfor procedural reform, was communication ed to the Government for their observa-tions. In a memorandum^: submitted to the Committee by the Lord President ofthe Council, the Government indicated that they were favourably disposed to only one of Sir G. Campion&apos;s proposals, but put forward seven alternative sugges-tions. The Select Committee have accepted, with modifications, three ofSir G. Campion&apos;s proposals, including the one favoured by the Government, andhave taken two others as the basis for fresh proposals of their own; they have however rejected, either explicitly or by implication, all the suggestions of theGovernment.4. We have assumed that no further consideration need be given to thoseof Sir G. Campion&apos;s proposals which have been rejected both by the Governmentand the Select Committee. Our report, therefore, consists, in Part I, of an examination of the recommendations of the Select Committee in the light of theviews already expressed on behalf of the Government, and, in Part II, of a recon-sideration of the Governments proposals in the light of the Select Committee^rejection of them. In Part III we summarise our conclusions and set out theproposals which we suggest that the Government should put to the House. for convenience of reference we append tabular statements summarising (Appendix I)Sir G. Campion&apos;s proposals with the comments originally made by the Govern-ment, the recommendations of the Select Committee and our own views, and(Appendix II) the Governments alternative proposals, the comments of the SelectCommittee and our recommendations.* H.C. 189; full version, including Minutes of Evidence, is H.O. 189-1t Appendix to TI.C. 189-1, pp. xxi-lxiv.I H.C. 189-1, pp. 97-102.
I. -Recommendations of the Select CommitteeReorganisation of Procedure in Supply5.   The Select Committee&apos;s recommendations on this matter are : &quot; (a) Supplementary Estimates and the four days on which Mr. Speaker ismoved out of the Chair on first going into Committee of Supply shouldbe included in the number of allotted days; the number of allotted daysshould be increased to 28, and they should be spaced evenly over the session. This arrangement should not be regarded as diminishing thenormal claims of the Opposition upon the time of the House. Thereshould be two guillotines, one in March and one in July.(b) It should be permissible by agreement between the Government and theOpposition through the usual channels on not more than four allotteddays in addition to the four days on which Mr. Speaker is moved outof the chair on first going into Committee of Supply to have a debate on the question &quot; That Mr. Speaker do now leave the chair.&quot;(c) Debate on the question &quot;That Mr. Speaker do now leave the chair&quot;should be freed from the rule which forbids reference to mattersinvolving legislation.(d) The ballot for precedence in moving amendments to the question &quot; ThatMr. Speaker do now leave the chair &quot; should be retained for the four days on first going into Committee of Supply. On any other day whenthe new procedure may be agreed upon, the right to frame theamendment should be exercised by the Opposition.&quot;6. This scheme originates from the only one of Sir G. Campion&apos;s proposalswhich was favourably received by the Government. It is probably the mostimportant single recommendation now under consideration; it is certainly theone from which the greatest saving of Parliamentary time may be expected. sir g. Campion based it on the argument that the function of the House which isdischarged through the supply procedure is now hardly at all the review offinancial policy, but primarily the control of administrative policy; and that from his point of view the existing procedure suffers from the following defects : (a) The discussion of Supplementary Estimates often consumes a disproportionate-tionate amount of time, being exempt from any form of guillotine.(&amp;) The opportunities provided by the days allotted to Supply are concen-trated in a short period of the session between March and July,whereas they are needed throughout the session.(c) Debate on a Vote in Committee of Supply, when the only possible formof amendment is a conventional reduction of the Vote by a small sum,affords at best a very rough and ready peg on which to hang criticism of administrative policy.(d) The rule forbidding reference to matters requiring legislation is restric-tive, and capricious in its application.These arguments are in principle accepted in the Government&apos;s memorandum and the Select Committee&apos;s report. Both the Government and the Select Com-mittee, however, felt it necessary to modify in certain respects the actualproposals put forward by Sir G. Campion; and as the modifications are notidentical, the scheme recommended by the Committee, as set out in paragraph 5above, differs from that favoured by the Government in a number of details,which are considered in the following paragraphs.7. The number of Allotted Days. The Select Committee, agreeing on thispoint with Sir G. Campion, propose that the number should be 28. This figure is reached by adding together the 20 Supply Days allotted at present, the 4 dayson which the Speaker is first moved out of the Chair, and the 4 days which onthe average have been spent on Spring Supplementary Estimates. The Govern-ment, however, noted that on two of the 28 days Sir G. Campion proposed thatprecedence should be given to Reports of the proposed Committee on public expenditure, so that the number of days actually available for supply might inany given Session be reduced to 26; and as they were not in favour of setting upthe proposed Committee at all, and in any case took the view that the time spent on Spring Supplementaries ha,d often been excessive, they suggested that28 days were too many, and proposed 26. We have no hesitation in recommending that this view should be adhered to, for the reasons given. The difference is not one of principle so much as1 of expediency; and the saving of time which this
4 1* 2j&quot; v.V iLoffers is one of the Government&apos;s chief objectives in supporting the scheme asa whole. Later in this Eeport (paragraphs 15-19), we recommend that theGovernment should maintain their opposition to the recommendation for a public expenditure Committee; if so, the case for devoting two allotted days to itsreports falls to the ground *8. Spreading of Allotted Days. One of the chief features of this schemeis that the allotted days, instead of being concentrated, as at present, in theoeriod between March and July, should be spaced evenly over the session. Sir G.Campion himself went further, suggesting that there might be ia return to the oldpractice of setting apart for this purpose a particular day of the week -hesuggested Thursday. The Government regarded this as too inflexible, pointing out that on occasion it might be the general desire to take two allotted daystogether for a single debate. The Select Committee agree that a rigid rule wouldbe impracticable, and make no reference to the point in their recommendations,but in the body of their Report (paragraph 20) appear to favour &quot; a general understanding&apos;&apos; that Thursday would normally be an allotted day. We recom-mend that the Government adhere to their former view on this point, opposeany proposal for the introduction of a rigid rule, and make it clear that they regard complete flexibility as essential.9. Claims of the Opposition. The Select Committee have made the irrecommendation subject to a proviso that the normal claims of the Oppositionupon the time of the House should not be diminished. They apparently fear that when allotted days are more readily available for debates on general policy the Government may be more reluctant to give time on other days for such debates,and as a result the total amount of time devoted to such purposes may tend to diminish. This does not appear to us to call for any specific action on the partof the Government; if the point is raised, it should be sufficient to indicate thatthe Government have no intention of disregarding the claims of the Opposition.10. New Opportunities for Debate on Moving the Speaker out of the chair. This is the other main feature of the scheme that it should be possibleto have debates on the question : &quot; That Mr. Speaker do now leave the chair &quot;on allotted days, in addition to the four days on which such debates are held atpresent, and that on all such occasions debate should be freed from the rule whichforbids reference to matters requiring legislation. In principle this proposal was accepted by the Government: the Select Committee&apos;s recommendation differs from their own, however, on the following points of detail: (a) The Select Committee recommend that the decision to hold such a debate should be taken by agreement between the Government and theOpposition through the usual channels; the Government on the otherhand, proposed that they alone should decide. We believe, however,that what the Government had in mind was not that they shouldhave the right to insist on holding such a debate against the wishes of the Opposition, but that it should not be possible for such debatesto be held without the Governments consent. This is fully safe-guarded by the recommendation of the Select Committee, and wesuggest that it can be accepted.(b) Whereas the Government did not suggest any specific limitation on thenumber of such debates, the Select Committee recommend that thereshould be not more than four (in addition to the four held at present).The Committee have apparently put this forward to meet the pointmade in the Government memorandum that it would be undesirable for such debates to be held more frequently than debates in Committeeof Supply itself, since this would change the whole character of the debates and the estimates themselves might never become open to debate at all. While admitting the force of this point, we doubt whether the remedy proposed by the Select Committee is the right one.A provision that there should be &quot; not more than four &quot; might easilybecome a practice that there should be four : and in any given sessionthis might be too much. Conversely, if the procedure proved con-venient, it would be a pity that it should be subject to an arbitrary* Standing Orders at present allow the reports of the Public Accounts Committee and theEstimates Committee to be debated on a Supply Day, and there is no intention of altering this.In practice, however, the provision has been a dead letter, since there lias been no demand forsuch debates.
limitation. The fact that the agreement of both Government and opposition is required should, in our view, be sufficient to ensure thatthe new procedure is not used too frequently, and we recommend thatno limitation should be placed on it.(c) The Select Committee propose that on any day (other than the first four)on which it may be agreed to work under the new procedure, theright to frame the amendment should be exercised by the Opposition.The Government memorandum contained no proposal on this point:we think it clear, however, that the assumption underlying the wholeof the Governments comments was that the Opposition would framethe amendment, and it seems to us right on merits that the Opposi-tion should in this way choose the subject for debate on these as on other allotted days. We therefore recommend the acceptance of thisproposal.11. Reference to Matters Requiring Legislation. Although there is nowno difference of view on this point between the Government and the Select Com-mittee, it is of sufficient importance to warrant special mention. Sir G. Campion&apos;original proposal was that debates on moving the Speaker out of the chair shouldbe free from the rule excluding matters involving legislation. In the Govern -ment memorandum the view was taken that this went too far; instead it was proposed that the rule should be automatically relaxed only on the four days when such debates arise at present, and for other such debates only if the Govem-ment put down a specific motion for the purpose. When the Lord Presidentgave evidence on this point before the Select Committee, it was suggested that,the Governments point would be met in substance if the Standing or SessionalOrder dealing with the suspension of the rule were drafted so as to limit thepermissible references to legislation to those which Avere incidental to the questionof administration under debate. The Lord President undertook to consider this, and a draft Sessional Order on these lines was approved by Ministers andcommunicated to the Select Committee, as follows : 1&quot; Notwithstanding the practice of the House which prohibits referenceto matters involving legislation in the course of debate in, or on going into,Committee of Supply, Mr. Speaker may, when an amendment to the question&apos;&apos; That Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair &apos; for Committee of Supply isunder discussion, permit such incidental reference to legislative action ashe may consider relevant to any matter of administration then under debate,when enforcement of the prohibition would, in his opinion, unduly restrict the discussion of such matter.&quot;The effect of this is to drop the requirement that on certain occasions the rule should be suspended only if the Government so move; in other words the Govern-ment now agree with the Select Committee on this point.Statutory Instruments12.   The Select Committee recommend  &apos;&apos; A select committee should be appointed in the coming session, orpreferably the House of Lords should be invited to concur in the appoint-ment of a joint committee, to inquire into the delegation of legislative powerand the procedure of the Houses in relation thereto.&quot;13. This recommendation is the result of lengthy consideration given by theSelect Committee to a suggestion by Sir G. Campion that, in order to improve the control of the House over delegated legislation, the Select Committee onStatutory Rules and Orders should be given the additional functions of(a) reporting to the House any matters it thought fit with regard to StatutoryRules and Orders subject to negative resolution, and (6) inquiring into anycomplaints with regard to any Statutory Rule or Order already in operation, and reporting their findings to the House. As in the end the Select Committee didnot accept this suggestion, there is no need to repeat here the strong objectionsto it which were advanced in the Government memorandum; it is to be noted,however, that the tone of the Select Committee&apos;s Report is generally favourable to the object of the suggestion, which would almost certainly be revived if an inquiry were instituted as recommended by the Select Committee.14. The proposal to hold such an inquiry will no doubt be widely supportedby those who disapprove of the growing use of subordinate legislation; it willbe argued that much has happened since the last time this subject was
sauthoritatively investigated, by the Donoughmore Committee on Ministers&apos;Powers, which reported in 1932. We are inclined to agree that, at some time inthe future, an inquiry would be useful; we think, however, that the time for it isnot yet ripe, for the following reasons : (a) The scope and form of delegated legislation at the present time isprobably still abnormally influenced by war-time powers and practice.When the emergency powers temporarily continued by the supplies and Services (Transitional Powers) Act and the Emergency Laws(Transitional Provisions) Act, 1946, have come to an end or been replaced by powers based on permanent legislation, the form and scope of delegated legislation will assume a more normal aspect.(b) The Statutory Instruments  Act, 1946, will, when it is brought intogeneral operation, remove a number of existing anomalies and effectcertain clmnges in procedure. The present intention is that thisshould be at the commencement of the next session. Clearly before then there would be no firm basis on which an inquiry could be made;and even afterwards, it would probably be preferable to allowsufficient time for experience to be gained of the working of the Act.We therefore recommend that the Government, while not opposing the principleof this recommendation of the Select Committee, should indicate that they do not regard the present time as appropriate for the inquiry suggested.Public Expenditure Committee15.   The Select Committee recommend : :&apos; (a) There should be a single Select Committee, called the Public expenditure committee, with an order of reference combining the functions of theCommittee of Public Accounts and the Select Committee on estimates.&quot; (&amp;) Provision should be made for securing discussion in the House of theReports of the proposed Public Expenditure Committee by giving them precedence on not more than two allotted Supply Days.&quot;16. This recommendation in effect reproduces a proposal by Sir G. Campion,to which strong objections were advanced in the Government memorandum. Thechief difference of substance is that, whereas Sir G. Campion provided for a seriesof sub-Committees under the new body, the Select Committee leave the number and duties of sub-Committees to be decided by the new body itself, and so do notreproduce the suggestion, to which the strongest objection was taken by theGovernment spokesmen, that there should be a sub-Committee for &quot; special short-term inquiries into current complaints.&quot;1.7. The grounds on which the Select Committee base their recommendationare first that, although the functions of the two existing Committees are inprinciple distinct, &quot; their subject-matter is, in fact, the same,&quot; secondly, that thePublic Accounts Committee often looks forward from the year of accountsbefore them to the current year, while the Estimates Committee often carries itsinvestigation backwards to the same years; thirdly, that the examination of accounts would assist the examination of current expenditure; and, lastly, that asystem of sub-Committees under a single Committee is the most satisfactory way of avoiding inconsistency between the Accounts and Estimates sides..18. It cannot be said that the evidence taken by the Select Committeerevealed wide support for the proposal. Sir G. Campion naturally supportedit, as did Captain Diver, who wag Clerk to the National Expenditure Committeeduring the war; the latter, however, admitted that the position of the comptroller and Auditor-General might be jeopardised if he got improperly involved inforward or current enquiries. Sir Gilbert Upcott himself (then comptroller and Auditor-General) stressed the distinction between the functions of the two existing Committees, pointed out that only one case had occurred of incon-sistency between them, and expressed the view that the reports of the public accounts Committee operated as a continuing check on wasteful expenditure.He added that the Comptroller and Auditor-General and his staff were not qualified, and should not be asked, to express views on the Estimates. Mr. Peakeand Mr. Benson, who gave evidence as the Chairman and senior member respec-tively of the Public Accounts Committee, stressed the judicial nature of thewommittee&apos;s functions.   The reports of a sub-Committee of four or five members
would not carry the same weight as those of the present Public Accounts Com-mittee, and in important matters it might be necessary for the proposed Com-mittee to hear again evidence taken by one of their sub-Committees.19. We have carefully reviewed the whole matter in the light of the SelectCommittee&apos;s report and of a memorandum submitted to us on behalf of theTreasury, in which we were informed that, in the view of the Chancellor of theExchequer, the proposal should be rejected by the Government.We agree with this view for the following reasons : (a) It is not true, as the SeOect Committee assert, that the subject-matter ofthe Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee is thesame. The former body examines a number of accounts which haveno counterpart in the Estimates.(&amp;) The charge of lack of co-ordination between the two existing Committeesis not borne out by the evidence; only one case of inconsistent reportsis known. Satisfactory liaison can be obtained by overlappingmembership and by consultation between the Chairmen and Clerks.(c) The Public Accounts Committee has a judicial character and oftenconsiders questions of constitutional importance on which it is essen-tial that all Departments should be treated alike. This will be moredifficult if the accounts are actually examined by a number of sub-committees, and in order to secure it the main Committee may have toduplicate their work. This might also be necessary in important caseswhere it was felt that the sub-committee&apos;s report would not, by itself,carry sufficient weight.(d) If several sub-committees of the proposed Committee were sitting at once,it would be difficult for sufficiently senior officers of the Exchequer andAudit Department to attend them all, and impossible to maintain thearrangement which is of long standing and to which the Treasuryattach great importance whereby the Treasury Officers of Accountsattend all meetings at which the Public Accounts Committee takesevidence.(e) Regularity of expenditure and economy of administration, secured bystrict financial control under the personal responsibility of AccountingOfficers, are of fundamental importance, and are recognised as suchby being the concern of a separate Committee, the Public accounts committee. If they become only a part of the responsibilities of aCommittee which is also concerned with the Estimates, there is aserious risk that they will be neglected, in favour of the more popularexercise of criticising current expenditure.(/) Although the Select Committee suggest that there would be no change inthe duties of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, it is most likely that he would be consulted by the new body on questions of current expenditure. This would be alien and prejudicial to his statutoryduties.(g) It has always been regarded by the Government as fundamental that theEstimates Committee should have no power to deal with policy. Thiswould apply to the proposed Committee, which is to have no powersbeyond those of the two existing bodies. The history, however, of thewar-time Select Committee on National Expenditure shows that theproposed Committee would be likely to encroach on policy and thuscome into conflict with Ministers.Private Members&apos; Time20.   The Select Committee recommend &quot; (a) Facilities for private Members to initiate business should be restored assoon as possible, and, in any case, the provision of Standing order no. 10, which enables Members to bring in Bills under &quot; The TenMinutes&apos; Rule,&quot; should be made available again.(b) The first 20 Fridays after the debate on the Address should be private members&apos; days, motions and Bills to be taken on alternate Fridays.(c) The first 6 Bill Fridays should be for second readings, the last 4 for reportstages and third readings.(d) There should be a single ballot for Bills and motions.   Members successful in the ballot should have the choice of either introducing a Bill or
moving a motion and according to their place in the list should haveprecedence in choosing a Friday. In the case of motions, notice of theterms in which it is intended to be moved should be handed in in timeto appear on the notice paper circulated on the Friday before it is tobe debated.&quot;21 The first of these proposals, that private Members&apos; time should be restored as soon as possible, is a matter of policy, which we assume to have been settled for the present session by the decision of the House on 13th November,1946 The question when any restoration will be possible is a matter for decision by the Government, in the light of the circumstances of the time. We do not therefore feel called upon to make any recommendation on this point.22. The remaining three proposals constitute a new scheme for the allocation of private Members&apos; time which can be considered without prejudice to the ques-tion of the date when such time can be restored. In commenting on a rather different scheme proposed by Sir G. Campion, the Government indicated in their memorandum that they were disposed to agree that plans might well be devised for increasing the usefulness of private Members&apos; time and that, while they hadnot examined Sir G. Campion&apos;s proposals in detail, they would welcome an oppor-tunity of considering the matter further. We have therefore examined thescheme sympathetically, and have reached the conclusion that there would be considerable advantage, from the point of view of the Government, in the pro-posal that all private Members&apos; time should be on Fridays, instead of beingdivided between Wednesdays and Fridays as hitherto. This would have the effectof making four full days in each week available for the ordinary business of theHouse, while private Members would have the day on which, owing to the difficultyof securing adequate attendance, it is seldom possible for the Government to putdown important or controversial business. The other features of the scheme areof less concern to the Government, and we do not feel competent to pronounce on them, but so far as we can judge the)^ are fair and practicable.23. The precise regulation of private Members&apos; time is, of course, a matter which is chiefly of concern to the House as a whole and particularly to private members themselves, and there may be opposition to the scheme on the groundthat, as the Select Committee note, it gives private Members rather less time thanthe previous arrangement. That being so, we think that, while the Governmentwould no doubt wish to oppose any proposal to give private Members substantially more time than they had before, within these limits they need not commit them-selves to the detailed provisions of the particular scheme put forward, and mightbe prepared to leave those to the free vote of the House. If this course were adopted it would probably be useful to take soundings beforehand of the views ofthe other principal political parties. We recommend, therefore, that the Govern-ment should indicate that they are favourably disposed to the Select Committee&apos;scheme, and that when it is possible for private Members&apos; time to be restored, theywill move the amendments to Standing Orders necessary to bring it into effect.The Adjournment Motion under Standing Order No. 824.   The Select Committee recommend :&quot; The time spent on adjournment motions under Standing Order No. 8should automatically be made up by exempting the superseded business forthe corresponding amount of time.&apos;&apos;25. This reproduces part of a proposal by Sir G. Campion, which was rejected as a whole in the Government memorandum. The chief point, however, to whichthe Government objected was Sir G. Campion&apos;s suggestion that the decision whether the matter proposed to be raised was of &quot; urgent public importance &quot;should rest not, as at present, with the Chair, but with the Member raising thematter and his supporters; and Ministers took the view that, if this suggestionwere rejected, the rest of the proposal would not be pressed. As it happens, how-ever, the Select Committee, while agreeing with the Government that the decisionon urgency and public importance should be left to the Chair, have accepted theone part of Sir G. Campion&apos;s proposal which is of advantage to the Government,in minimising the disturbance to their business which these motions inevitablycause.  We therefore recommend that the Government should accept this proposal.
II. The Government&apos;s Alternative proposals the Report Stage of the Budget Resolutions26. Attention was drawn in the Government memorandum to the repetitivecharacter of Budget debates under the present procedure, which involves duplication-tion between the Committee Stage of the Budget Resolutions and the SecondReading of the Finance Bill, and again between the Report Stage of the Resolu-tions and the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill. Since it would be difficultto formalise either of the first pair of stages, the Government proposed that, onthe Report Stage of the Resolutions, the question should be put withoutamendment or debate.27.   The Select Committee reject this proposal on the following grounds: (a) The duplication is more apparent than real, since the Report Stage ofthe Resolutions is used for general financial discussion, while theCommittee Stage of the Finance Bill is devoted to-details;(6) The stage which the Government propose to formalise is the &quot;first opportunity on which Members can express their opinion by vote on each separate proposal,&quot; and there is some advantage in having a debate then, with an interval for consideration before the introductionof the Bill;(c) The total time available for discussing taxation is not excessive, andif any of it is wasted that is the fault of Members.It should be noted that at the meeting of the Select Committee when thisproposal was rejected, only 10 of the 16 members (other than the Chairman)were present. Of these, 5 were Labour members, who voted in favour of theGovernment proposal, and 5 were Conservative, and voted against: the matter was then decided by the Chairman&apos;s casting vote.28. In our view the Government should proceed with this proposal, not-withstanding its rejection by the Select Committee. In spite of what theCommittee say, it is the fact that at present there is too much tedious repetition of debate; the Committee suggest that this may be the fault of Members, butit may equally be regarded as evidence that not all the opportunities for debateare necessary. The change will not deprive Members of the opportunity, to whichthe Select Committee attach importance, of expressing their opinion by vote on each separate Resolution; and further consideration, in the interval before theintroduction of the Finance Bill, can be based on the debate on the committee stage of the Resolutions. It would seem from the voting in the Select Committeethat the proposal will commend itself to the Government supporters in the House.It is strongly supported by the Treasury, who have informed us that theChancellor of the Exchequer wishes to have the new arrangements in operation by April next.29. If it is decided to do this, it will also be necessary, as was noted inthe Government memorandum, to provide that on the Committee Stage all theresolutions except one shall be taken immediately after the Chancellor&apos;s budget speech, the Committee dividing if necessary. This is essential if the timegained by formalising the Report Stage of the resolutions is not to be lost bya corresponding prolongation of the Committee Stage : moreover, the immediatepassing of some of the resolutions is essential to operate the machinery of theProvisional Collection of Taxes Act. At present the resolutions are passed byagreement immediately after the Chancellor &apos;s speech, but presumably the Opposi-tion may not be so ready to accept them without separate discussion, if theycannot be further discussed on Report. A number of minor questions arise inthis connection, which will be taken up by the Treasury.Report Stage of Bills kept on the Floor of the House30. It was proposed in the Government memorandum that on the report stage of Bills kept on the floor of the House, debate should be restricted, byOrder, to Government amendments, points left over at the Committee Stage forfurther consideration and new points arising after the completion of the Com-mittee Stage. This was not to apply to the Finance Bill, if the proposal regardingthe Budget resolutions was accepted; alternatively, that proposal would be dropped, if this one were accepted and applied to the Finance Bill.
31 The Select Committee reject this proposal on the ground that effect is sufficiently given to it in practice by the Speaker&apos;s selection of amendments,and that a formal rule would give rise to difficulties of interpretation; they point out that so long as it is the practice to send nearly all bills to standing committees, the rule could not save much time.32 This last point was admitted in evidence to the Select Committee bythe Lord President, who indicated a strong preference for the proposal regardingthe Budget resolutions; and if that is, as we recommend, accepted, and mconsequence the proposed rule is not to be applied to the Finance Bill, it wouldcertainly save very little time indeed. We therefore recommend that the Govern-ment should accept the view of the Select Committee, and not proceed with thisproposal.Recommittal Procedure33. This was a proposal that the procedure for the limited recommittalof a bill should be the same as that for the recommittal of the whole bill, i.e., thatthe Speaker should permit only an explanatory statement from the mover ofthe motion and a similar statement by one member opposed to it, and then put the question. The Select Committee reject it on the ground that it would makeit impossible for the terms of such motions to be extended by the addition offurther clauses and amendments. We do not propose to argue the merits ofthis point, since the chief object of the proposal was to make the preceding one more effective, by preventing evasion of the proposed restriction on amendmentsthrough the device of staging debates on motions for the recommittal of particularclauses. If, as we recommend, the former proposal is not proceeded with, thechief justification for this one disappears : we accordingly recommend that itsrejection by the Select Committee should be accepted.Powers of the Chairman of Ways and Means and the Deputy Chairman34. The Government proposed that in all proceedings of the House theChairman of Ways and Means and the Deputy Chairman should have power toaccept closure motions whenever either of them is sitting as Deputy Speaker andnot only, as at present, when the Speaker&apos;s unavoidable absence has previously been announced. The Select Committee recognise that this proposal would meet a situation which has caused inconvenience in the past; they reject it, however,on the ground that it would tend to blur the distinction between the Speaker,who is elected by the House upon a motion moved and seconded by unofficial members, and the Chairman of Ways and Means and the Deputy&apos; Chairman,who are appointed on the motion of a Minister of the Crown from the supporters of the Government. They say that Standing Order No. 80 expressly limits theauthority of these officers as Deputy Speaker to the one day on which the Speaker&apos;sunavoidable absence has been previously announced, and that this Standing order was made with the consent of the Crown and received statutory authority by the deputy Speaker Act, 1855.35. In view of the implication in the Select Committee&apos;s comment thatamendment of the Deputy Speaker Act would be necessary to effect the change proposed by the Government, we have carefully examined the basis of the present practice. The terms of the Deputy Speaker Act are quite general, and, we are advised, would not preclude amendment of Standing Order No. 80 : it has in fact been amended four times since 1855. Further, it is stated in Erskine May thatthe practice is based, not on that Standing Order, but on Standing order no. 26 (5), which is certainly not affected by the Deputy Speaker Act. Theposition is, however, confused, and it is not clear to us how the practice can bededuced from either Standing Order. This confusion and the other points madein the Select Committee&apos;s report, suggest that the proposal is capable of arousingconsiderable controversy; and having regard to the fact that inconvenience hasresulted from the present practice, so far as we are aware, only once, it is forconsideration whether the point is worth pressing. The matter is one with whichthe Speaker is closely concerned, although his viewTs on it were not heard by theSelect Committee; it might therefore be useful to consult him, since, if it appeared that he did not share the Select Committee&apos;s apprehensions, the case for proceeding would be considerably strengthened. Our recommendation is, there-fore, that the Government should not insist on the proposal, except after full consultation with the Speaker.
Business Committee36. This was a proposal that there should be a Committee of the Houseconsisting of the members of the Chairman&apos;s Panel and five other Membersnominated by Mr. Speaker, to be known as the &quot; Business Committee.&quot; Xhcfunctions of this Committee would be to subdivide any time which may be allocated, either by guillotine resolution or by voluntary agreement, to theCommittee Stage of any bill kept on the floor of the House, or to the Report Sba^eof any bill, between the various parts of the bill. This is a modified form of\proposal, which the Select Committee rejected in their First Report, that thereshould be a Committee with such functions in respect of any stage Of any billsubject to a guillotine resolution. The earlier proposal was considered by theSelect Committee chiefly in relation to the Committee stages of bills sent upstairsand for these they considered that a sub-Committee of the Standing Committeewould be preferable. This was accepted by the Government as an improvement on their own proposal. In their subsequent memorandum to the Select Committeehowever, the Government pointed out that no provision had been made for sub-dividing any time which might be allocated to stages taken on the floor of theHouse, and for this purpose revived the proposal in the present form. The SelectCommittee took the view that no new point had arisen to justify them in reopeningthe matter.37. It may admittedly be somewhat awkward to raise this again, in viewof the Lord Presidents statement in the House* that the Government accepted theSelect Committee&apos;s modification of their earlier proposal; nevertheless, it wouldfill an admitted gap in the arrangements, and on the whole we think that theGovernment would be justified in putting it to the House.Powers of the Chairman in Committee38. In this case also the Select Committee refused to reconsider a proposal which they had rejected in their First Report, that in Committee the Chairmanshould have power to disallow debate on the question &quot; That the Clause standpart,&quot; if of opinion that the principle of the clause and all substantial points arising thereon, had been adequately discussed on amendments. On this point the Lord President informed the Houset that, while the amount of time involvedwas slight, there was an opportunity in the present procedure for wasting time,and that the Government therefore proposed to ask the Select Committee to look at the question again.   This, however, the Committee have declined to do.39. In these circumstances we think that the Government should now put the proposal to the House. There is, however, one point to which we should draw attention. The original proposal concerned the powers of the Chairman in committee, that is both in Standing Committee and on the floor. When, however,it was put to the Select Committee for the second time, it was expressed as beinglimited to proceedings in Standing Committee only. So far as we can see, thisarose through an error in drafting; it was not the intention to vary the proposal in this respect, and in his oral evidence to the Select Committee the Lord Presidentindicated that in his view the proposal should apply to all Committee proceedings.Financial Resolutions40. The Select Committee make no reference in their Report to a proposal in the Government memorandum for the abolition of the rule under which a financial Resolution is required to cover provisions of a bill requiring money tobe paid into the Exchequer. This also was a proposal which had been previouslysubmitted to the Select Committee; in their First Report they said that they considered that it would be more appropriate to deal with the point in the courseof their later inquiries.; for some reason, however, they have not done so.41. In the circumstances, therefore, the Government would be justified inputting the matter to the House; the rule can be shown to be anomalous, since itdoes not apply to provisions requiring payments to be made to a particularMinister or to the Treasury, although the practical effect is the same. TheTreasury have pointed out, however, that there are very few occasions when a financial Resolution is required solely to comply with this rule. i.e., when thereare no other provisions requiring a Financial Resolution. The amount of timelikely to be saved is, therefore, very small indeed.  The Treasury suggest, and we* 15th November, 1945, 0.11., Cols. 2348-9.I 15th November, 1945, O.B., Cols. 2349-50.
wee that if the Government are to take views contrary to the Select Committeeon other much more important matters, this particular proposal need not be pressed.HI. Summary of Recommendationsa9 The points at issue between the Select Committee and the Governmentare twelve in number : five proposals by the Select Committee, and seven by theGovernment Of the former, we recommend that the Government should accepttwo and reject three; of the Government proposals, none of which were acceptedby the Select Committee, we recommend that the Government should put three to the House, drop three, and not proceed with the other except after full consultation with the Speaker.   This may be summarised as follows :-(a) Select Committee Recommendations to be accepted.(i) Reorganisation of Supply Procedure-with certain modifica-tions* (paragraphs 5-11).(ii) Scheme for private Members&apos; time without prejudice to thedate when such time can. be restored, and the decision on detailsbeing left to the free vote of the House (paragraphs 20-23).(iii) Compensation for time spent on Adjournment Motions underS.O. No. 8 (paragraphs 24 and 25).(b) Select Committee Recommendations to be rejected.(iv) Inquiry into delegated legislation at least for the present (para-graphs 12-14).(v) Public Expenditure Committee (paragraphs 15-19).(c) Government proposals to be put to the House.(vi) Formalisation of the Report Stage of the Budget Resolutions(paragraphs 26-29).(vii) Business Committee to sub-divide time allocated to certain stages of bills (paragraphs 36 and 37).(viii) Restriction of debate in Committee on the question &quot; That theClause stand part &quot; (paragraphs 38 and 39).(d) Government proposals to be dropped... (ix) Restriction of Debate on Report Stage of bills kept on the floor of the House (paragraphs 30-32).(x) Restriction of Debate on motions for the limited recommittal ofa bill (paragraph 33).(xi) Abolition of rule requiring a Financial Resolution to cover thepayment of money into the Exchequer (paragraphs 40 and 41).(e) Government proposal not to be proceeded with, except after consultationwith the Speaker.(xii) Power for the Chairman of Ways and Means and the deputy chairman to accept closure motions in all circumstances (para-graphs 34 and 35).43. If these recommendations are accepted, the next step is presumably to announce the Governments views on the Select Committee&apos;s Report and toarrange for the matter to be debated by the House. In view of the desire of theChancellor of the Exchequer that the new Budget procedure should be in opera-tion by April next, this should be done fairly soon. The announcement should state which of the Select Committee&apos;s recommendations are not acceptable to theGovernment and what steps the Government propose to take to implement thosewhich they do accept and those of their own proposals with which they intend to. proceed in spite of the Select Committee&apos;s rejection. In each case these stepswill consist in moving amendments, to the Standing Orders of the House. Mostof these could appropriately be moved at the first opportunity; the proposedreorganisation of Supply Procedure, however, could hardly be brought in as a* Twenty-six days instead oi twenty-eight, and no fixed limit on the number of days whichmay be used for debates on moving the Speaker out of the Chair[33270] D 2
whole* before the commencement of the next session, while it would be unrealto introduce the scheme for private Members&apos; time until such time can be restored. From this point of view our positive recommendations may be sum-marised as follows : (a) Reorgansiation of Supply procedure Government should announce that at the commencement of the next session they will propose amendments to Standing Orders to give effect to thefollowing : (i) Twenty-six days, spread throughout the session, should be allotted to supplementary Estimates, moving the Speaker out of the Chair andthe business of the Committee of Supply. There should be twoguillotines, fixed by reference to calendar dates, in March and July.(ii) It should be permissible, by agreement between the Government andthe Opposition, through the usual channels, to have a debate on thequestion &quot; That Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair &quot; on any allottedday, in addition to the four days on which Mr. Speaker is moved outof the chair on first going into Committee of Supply for the navy,army, air or civil estimates.(iii) Debate on the question &quot;That Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair&quot;should be freed from the rule which forbids reference to mattersinvolving legislation. (A draft Sessional Order to give effect to thisis reproduced in paragraph 11.)(iv) On the four days on which Mr. Speaker is moved out of the chair on first going into Committee of Supply for the navy, army, air or civil estimates, the ballot for precedence in moving amendments to thequestion should be retained : on any other day, when the new pro-cedure may be agreed upon, the right to frame the amendment shouldbe exercised by the Opposition.(b) Private Members&apos; TimeThe Government should indicate that, when it becomes possible to restoreprivate Members&apos; time, they would be in favour of amending the relevantStanding Orders to bring in a scheme on the following lines : (i) The first 20 Fridays after the debate on the Address should be private members&apos; days, motions and bills to be taken on alternate Fridays.(ii) The first six bill Fridays should be for second readings, the last fourfor Report stages and third readings.(iii) There should be a single ballot for bills and motions.   Memberssuccessful in the ballot should have a choice of either introducing abill or moving a motion and, according to their place in the list, shouldhave precedence in choosing a Friday. In the case of motions, noticeof the terms in which it is intended to be moved should be handed inin time to appear on the notice paper circulated on the Friday before it is to be debated.(c) Other proposals the Government should move amendments to Standing Orders to give effectto the following : (i) Adjournment Motion under Standing Order No. 8.The time spent on adjournment motions under Standing order no. 8 should automatically be made up by exempting the supersededbusiness for a corresponding amount of time.(ii) Budget Resolutions.In Committee of Ways and Means all the Budget resolutionsexcept one should be taken immediately after the Chancellor&apos;s budget speech, the Committee dividing if necessary.On the Report stage of the Budget Resolutions, the question should be put without amendment or debate.Any necessary minor consequential modifications of procedure should be made.* It would be possible, if it were thought desirable, to experiment in the remainder of thepresent session with additional debates on moving the Speaker out of the Chair, and the treeingof such debates from the rule which excludes reference to matters involving legislation.
,17J. 0 0(iii) Business Committee.There should be a Committee of the House, consisting of themembers of the Chairmen&apos;s panel and five other members nominated by Mr. Speaker, with the function of sub-dividing the time allocated,by guillotine resolution or voluntary agreement, to the committee stage of any bill kept on the floor of the House, or to the Report stage of any bill.(iv) Restriction of Debate in Committee.In any proceedings in Committee, the Chairman should have powerto disallow debate on the question &quot; That the Clause stand part,&quot; ifof opinion that the principle of the clause, and all substantial points arising thereon, have been adequately discussed on amendments.And, if after consultation with Mr. Speaker, the Government decide toproceed with it: -(v) Powers of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means.The Chairman of Ways and Means and the Deputy Chairmanshould have power to accept the closure whenever either of them issitting as Deputy Speaker, and not, as at- present, only when theunavoidable absence of Mr. Speaker has previously been announced.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee :; FRANK SOSKICE.Royal Courts of Justice, W.C. 2,24th February, 1947.
