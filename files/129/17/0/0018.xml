I ask my colleagues to agree : (i) That we should resist any claims which may be put forward for currentreparation deliveries either from Eastern or Western Germany.(ii) That as a principal condition of economic unity we should obtainRussian agreement to bearing a reasonable share in the burden alreadyborne and to be borne by the Occupying Powers in respect of reliefimports and external costs of occupation of Germany as a whole.(iii) The demand for reparations from current production should not be refused outright. It should, however, be made clear that it cannotbe considered until Germany has established a favourable foreign exchange balance and has met the expenses incurred by the occupying powers.(iv) That we should insist on an upward revision of the level of IndustryPlan with a minimum steel production level of 10 million tons, the steel using industries being adjusted to a level appropriate to thissteel output.(v) That we should insist on associating the discussion of economic problems with the consideration of the future political structure ofGermany.(vi) That for the purpose of dealing with points raised in (i)-(iv) above weshall table, at the earliest opportunity in Moscow, a new set of politicaland economic principles dealing with the treatment of germany during the second control period. A draft statement along the general lines contemplated is contained in Appendix &quot; A.&quot;2. The most crucial part of the Moscow discussions is likely to concern the short-term problems of Germany, political and economic. The political problems,so far as they can be treated independently, are discussed in detail in separatepapers circulated in the O.R.C. At the same time, the immediate political problems are very closely connected with the immediate economic problems and can only be considered in relation to them. The main economic topics likely tobe discussed in Moscow are three, namely, economic unity, level of industry and reparations. The historical background of these subjects is dealt with inAppendix &quot; B.&quot;13901   [33188] b
3. The background of long-term policy against which these immediateproblems must be viewed is as follows : Our aim in Germany is the creation of asingle State decentralised on federal lines, with her pre-war boundaries substan-tially unchanged except for the cession of some territory to Poland and Russia inthe east, and the inclusion of the Saar in the French Economic area. She shouldbe left with a sufficient industrial potential to ensure a reasonable standard ofliving, but this should be so designed as to interfere as little as possible with ourown export policy. German basic industries should be socialised. The west bankof the Rhine and the Ruhr should be occupied, the former by the. forces of thelimitrophe Powers and the latter by the forces of the western Powers, the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom. An international control should be set up overthe socialised industries of the Ruhr. The question of Russian participation inthis control should be deferred for later consideration.4. The first problem with which we are likely to be faced in Moscow is thedemand by Russia that we should recognise her right to take current reparation deliveries from her own zone and should agree to her receiving current deliveries from the Western Zones in exchange for an upward revision of the Level ofIndustry Plan. These demands can only be met at the cost of considerableadditional sacrifice by the British taxpayer. In our fusion agreement with the americans we accepted with some misgiving certain financial commitments whichin our present economic condition represent the absolute limit to which we can afford to go.  The Russian demands must therefore be rejected.-5. In the unlikely event of the Russians being prepared to accept economic unity and waive their claim to reparation deliveries, both from Eastern and western Germany, there is still no guarantee that economic unity would cost usless than it would if we were to continue to run the British and American zonesas a combined area separated from the rest of Germany. Although on presentation standards the Russian zone has a surplus of food-stuffs, it is substantiallydeficient in industrial raw materials. Moreover, industry in the Russian zonehas been largely depleted and what is left is badly in need of repair. Under thesecircumstances, there is likely to be a net outflow of goods from the Western zone and, if Russia were in practice to ignore the powers of German Central Adminis-trative Agencies throughout the whole country, these goods from the western zones could easily be shipped across the Eastern borders of Germany into poland and Russia. In other words, Russia would continue to take reparation deliveries from current production but in a disguised form.6. To safeguard ourselves against this position we should only accept unityif Russia is prepared to bear a fair share of the net liability of the occupying powers as a whole, including a share of the liability that has already been incurred by the United States and this country. This share might be equivalent to her50 per cent, claim of total reparation deliveries from Germany or at least equiva-lent to the proportion of the population of her zone to the population of the whole country.7. We should further insist on a substantial upward revision of the Level ofIndustry Plan to ensure that Germany is left with sufficient industrial capacity to render her economically viable. While we should not try to settle the details ofthe plan in Moscow we should at least seek to reach agreement on the level ofGerman steel capacity and of the related steel-using industries. We should not accept a lower figure for steel production than 10 million tons.      : i&apos; 8. We shall almost certainly be faced with demands for current reparationsat some future date. We should not refuse these demands altogether; but shouldtake the line that the question cannot be considered until Germany has estab-lished a favourable foreign exchange balance and the expenses incurred by the occupying Powers have been repaid. Should this position ever be reached thequestion could then be re-examined.... 9. Further general points on which we must insist as preconditions for economic agreement are the removal of restrictions on the inter-zonal movement ofGerman and Allied personnel and of goods, and the establishment of genuinefreedom of assembly and expression, subject to the minimum agreed requirementsof security.! : 10. Agreement on the terms outlined above will certainly meet with strongRussian opposition. We may find ourselves faced with a position in which we areurged to make small financial sacrifices in exchange for certain politico/economic
concessions. The attitude of the other Occupying Powers and of the germans and an account of the particular problems with which we are faced are elaboratedin Part II of the attached paper. In brief they suggest that if the discussions were to be confined to economic unity alone we might in certain circumstances find ourselves in a minority of one and in the eyes of the world opinion which is anxious to see unanimity amongst the Four Powers, regarded as the countryresponsible for failure.11. It is most important that this position should be avoided and that theresponsibility for failure of Potsdam and of quadripartite agreement should beplaced fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Russians, who are entirely responsible for the present state of affairs. To achieve this end, it willbe necessary to widen the discussion in order to cover the whole field of the potsdam Agreement. By ensuring that the field of discussion is extended to thepolitical and economic principles which we wish to establish, we shall reduce therisk of finding ourselves in a minority of one on economic questions. TheRussians are known to favour a centralised form of German Government. Onthe other hand, the American views are very similar to our own, while the French,who favour a confederate rather than a federal form, would support us againstthe Russians if faced with an exclusive choice.12. A comprehensive account of our policy towards Germany, which mustemerge from such discussions would be desirable not only for immediate tacticalreasons. By taking the initiative and putting forward comprehensive proposals,both political and economic, with regard to Germany, we will supply a need long-felt by the British public and. anticipate what will be an increasingly livelydemand for a further statement of policy.13. We should, therefore, table at an early opportunity a statement of thepolitical and economic principles which, in our view, should govern germany during the second period of control. This will be a logical sequel to the PotsdamAgreement which covered the initial control period and should be designed to lead up to an eventual peace treaty. A draft statement of the general sort whichI have in mind is attached at Appendix &quot;A.&quot; This is based on the broadlines of policy already laid down, which, so far as the economic sphere is con-cerned, are discussed in detail in Appendix &quot; B,&quot; and so far as concerns thepolitical sphere, in the papers submitted to the O.R.C. on the political drganisa-tion of Germany, the constitutional organisation of Germany, and interimcentral administrations.14. In the event of Russian acceptance of these new political and economicprinciples I should feel that we had made considerable progress. In the eventof failure, the Russians are far too concerned with preventing Germany from being split into two and the resources of the Ruhr from being incorporatedwithin a Western bloc, to counter a failure to reach agreement by abandoning the principle of quadripartite control. They would prefer to continue underthe present uneasy arrangements and would probably try and avoid loss of faceby asking that certain contentious points should be referred to the Deputies. Inthe meantime, we and the Americans, perhaps with the French, would continueto operate Western Germany independently of-the East, bartering the steel andindustrial products of the Ruhr for food-stuffs and other essential relief importsfrom the East. This would reduce our dollar commitments and thereby hasten the recovery of our Zone. As this economic recovery developed we should find ourselves in a stronger bargaining position with the Russians, whose one zone of occupation is likely to change from an asset to a liability as time goes on. Ifevents take this course, greater economic co-ordination will be necessary, and the consequent problem of closer political co-ordination will have to be faced.E.

APPENDIX &quot;A&quot;Principles for the Second Control PeriodPreambleIn the text of Part III of the Potsdam Agreement published on 2nd August,1948, were laid down the aims of the Allied occupation of Germany and thepolitical and economic principles to govern the treatment of Germany in the initial control period.The Controlling Powers reaffirm their acceptance of the aims and principlescontained in this Agreement. It is their purpose to extirpate Germanmilitarism and Nazism. It is not their intention to destroy or enslave the Germanpeople. It is their intention that the German people should reconstruct their lifeon a democratic and peaceful basis. They consider, however, that the initialcontrol period for which the Potsdam Principles were framed is now closed,and that the developments of events call for a further statement of the principles which should guide them during the second period of control which is now beginning. They are agreed that it will be their main task, and that of theGermans, during that period, to achieve the following aims : (1) To establish political conditions which will secure the world against any German reversion to dictatorship and any revival of Germanaggressive policy.(2) To establish economic conditions which will enable Germany to make good the damage done by Ffitler&apos;s war; and will further enableGermans and the world outside Germany to benefit from german industry and resources without re-establishing the economic foundations of an aggressive policy.(3) To establish constitutional machinery in Germany which will ensure theseends and which will be acceptable to the German people.(4) To establish, with this end in view, the maximum responsibility for and interest in political, administrative and economic developments along-democratic lines on the part of the Germans themselves.With these aims in view, the Controlling Powers have agreed upon thefollowing principles which shall guide them during the second control period, andin the execution of which Germans shall play a major part.A. Political Principles1. in furtherance of the policy of decentralising the political structure and developing local responsibility laid down in paragraph 9 of the PotsdamPrinciples, the objective of the Controlling Powers is to see eventually established in Germany a constitution based on the rule of law and providing for the divisionof powers between the constituent States or Lander and the Central government this division of powers will be made on the following principles :  (a) All powers will be vested in the Lander except such as are expresslydelegated to the Central Government, as set out in paragraph (b).(b) The Central Government as finally constituted will have legislative and executive responsibility in the subjects essential to secure : (i) The necessary political unity : especially nationality, naturalisation-tion, immigration, emigration and extradition; foreign affairs and the implementation of treaties.(ii) The necessary legal unity : especially criminal, civil and commer-cial law and procedure; copyrights, patents and trademarks;negotiable instruments, bills of lading and other documents of title to goods.(iii) The necessary economic unity : especially customs and foreign trade; import and export control; the maintenance of nationallyimportant communications by road, rail, water; posts and tele-graphs; weights and measures.(iv) The necessary financial unity : especially currency and coinage;certain powers for co-ordination of banking: the nationalpublic debt and guarantees; certain powers of taxation to beagreed; foreign exchange control.
2. The following principles will govern the ultimate form of the central german Government: (a) There shall be a President and two Chambers, one representing the nation as a whole, and the other the separate Laender. Both Chambers shallbe elected at regular intervals of not longer than five years.(&amp;) The rights and duties of the President shall be limited to those exercised by a constitutional head of State without independent executive authority.  He shall hold office for not more than five years.(c) The Chamber representing the nation as a whole shall be popularlyelected and shall be responsible for initiating and passing centrallegislation.(d) The Chamber representing the Laender shall be elected on the basis of equal representation for each Land. Its main concern will be toensure that legislation takes fully into consideration the interests ofthe Laender.(e) The members of the Central Government need not be members of theChambers, but shall be individually responsible to the popularlyelected Chamber for the exercise of their functions.(/) A Supreme Court shall be established to safeguard the constitution and determine questions of dispute between any two Laender or between any Land and the Central Government.3. The following will be the principal stages in the establishment inGermany of a constitutional democracy, as outlined in paragraphs 1 and 2 :  (a) Central Administrations, as envisaged in paragraph 9 of the PotsdamPrinciples, will be established to discharge the immediate tasks mostnecessary to ensure the economic unity of Germany.(b) A German representative body will be nominated at an early stage toadvise the Controlling Powers on the general aspects of the work ofthe central administrations and on the number and size of theLaender, and to work out within the framework of principles agreed by the Controlling Powers, on the basis of paragraphs 1 and 2 thedetails of a provisional constitution.(c) The recommendations of this advisory body will be submitted to the controlling Powers and on the basis of them elections shall be held anda provisional Government formed to operate the provisionalconstitution.(d) When due trial has been made of the provisional constitution under these:conditions the constitution will be amended after taking into account the recommendations of the provisional Government and ratified bythe German people and the Controlling Powers. At this stage anew Government will be duly elected.4. As pre-conditions for the establishment of the rule of law and for anydemocratic development in Germany the following rights shall be freely and immediately exercised by all Germans throughout Germany subject to theminimum agreed requirements of security by the Occupying Powers : freedomof speech; freedom of the press and radio; freedom of assembly; freedom of,movement and communication; freedom in religious affairs; freedom of the judiciary; freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment; and constitutionsof the Laender (and, as necessary, the constitution of the Central Government)will be so framed as to safeguard these rights.5. The Controlling Powers will reserve to themselves full authority inrespect of the following subjects :  (a) Demilitarisation and disarmament.(6) Denazification.(c) Decartelisation.(d) Security.(e) Reparations.(/) Restitution.(g) Prisoners of War and displaced persons.(h) War Criminals.(i) Immunities and requirements of the occupying forces and of the controlauthority. .    :(j) Foreign relations.Policy in the above subjects will be jointly laid down by the Controlling Powers,the execution of which shall in general be supervised by the Zone Commanders.
6. The Controlling Powers will retain forces of occupation in Germanyadequate to ensure that Germany is, and remains, disarmed and demilitarised.A quadripartite Allied Inspectorate will be established to ensure that the workof&apos; disarmament and demilitarisation is completed and maintained. The officersand agents of this Inspectorate shall conduct in any and all parts of german territory all necessary inspections, enquiries and investigations.7. The central administrative agencies refered to in paragraph 3 (a) above will be established by 1st April, 1947, and will exercise executive functions inthe fields of transport and communications, finance, foreign trade and industryand the distribution and production of essential materials and food-stuffs. their executive functions shall extend over the whole of Germany; their agents andany Allied supervisory staff will be free to travel throughout Germany. Inaccordance with paragraph 16 of the Potsdam Principles it should be brought home to the German people that the Central Agencies will operate under thepolicy direction of the Controlling Powers. The Controlling Powers will, how-ever, aim at devolving full executive responsibility on these central agencies as rapidly as circumstances permit. As soon as the provisional German CentralGovernments has been formed, it will assume the powers of the central adminis-trative agencies in so far as these are consistent with the definition of powers tobe delegated to the central authority contained in paragraph 1 above.8.   Control at this stage will be exercised as follows.: (a) The provisional Central Government, when established, shall exerciselegislative powers in the fields assigned to it by the constitutionsubject to the joint approval of the Controlling Powers and shallsupervise the execution of any such legislation by the appropriate authority and of any instructions, in the fields for which it iscompetent, of the Controlling Powers.(&amp;) The Controlling Powers may, when they think fit to do so, authorise theprovisional Central Government to enact legislation in any matters for which it is competent subject only to veto by the ControllingPowers.(c) The method of control over the exercise by Land Governments of powers for which they are exclusively competent shall be determined by ZoneCommanders.8. The Controlling Powers will exert their efforts to accelerate the repatria-tion of prisoners of war and surrendered German personnel held outsideGermany and to complete the process at the earliest practicable date. Theyfortifier reaffirm the decision of the Allied Control Council tnat no Germanshall be removed to work outside Germany without a contract signed voluntarilyand before his removal.B. Economic Principles10. It will be the aim of the Controlling Powers during the second controlperiod, subject to restrictions required in the interests of security, to enableGermany to make good the damage done by Hitler&apos;s war and to effect such furtherrestoration of her economy as may be necessary : her to pay for her essential imports from the proceeds of exportswithout external assistance;&apos; (b) to repay as soon as possible to the occupying Powers the sums advanced,since their armies first occupied German territory, on account of theimport requirements of the population of Germany and to pay for external occupation costs;(:c) to play her part in the restoration of a healthy economy in Europe as awhole.11. Steps shall be taken to ensure as from 1st July, 1947, the full and immediate application of paragraph 14 of the principles laid down in the potsdam Principles, which relates to the treatment of Germany as a singleeconomic unit. Accordingly as from the same date all restrictions on the move-ment of goods between the different zones of Germany shall be abolished and,in pursuance of paragraph 15 (c) of the Potsdam Principles, the resources ofeach part of Germany and all goods imported into Germany shall be used forthe benefit of Germany as a whole.
12. The appropriate Central German Administration will draw up acommon Export-Import programme for Germany as a whole with effect from 1st July, 1947. This programme, whidh will allow for the equitable distributionof indigenous resources throughout Germany, will be designed to achieve asufficient balance of exports over imports and thus fulfil the objective set outin paragraph 10 above. It will take into account the need to maximise coal production and agricultural output, improve housing conditions and restore thetransport system. The export-import programme will be subject to the approvalof the occupying Powers.13. In order that the appropriate German Central Administrative Agenciesmay be in a position to estimate the volume of export trade needed to achieve the objective in paragraph 10 above, the occupying Powers will render to theseAgencies within a period of three months an agreed statement showing theamounts owing to them up to 30th June, 1947, in respect of all imports into theirrespective Zones for the population of Germany from the date on which theirarmies first occupied German territory.. They will also furnish an agreed accountshowing the value of all exports from current production and stocks, which havebeen exported from each zone since the same date. The difference between exports and imports will be the amount owing by Germany on this account to the fouroccupying Powers and the export-import plan will be based on the assumptionthat this amount, plus any further sums that may be advanced in respect ofimports for the civilian population and displaced persons or otherwise, will be repaid.14. The occupying Powers shall also render to the appropriate GermanCentral Agencies an agreed account of their external occupation costs up to30th June. 1947, and shall render further agreed accounts at three-monthly intervals thereafter. These sums shall be regarded as debts due from Germanyto the occupying Powers, ranking for repayment after the sums mentioned inparagraph 13, and the manner of their repayment shall be determined in thePeace Treaty.15. The financial burden already incurred and which may in future be incurred by the occupying Powers will be divided between these Powers inequitable proportions as may be mutually agreed.16. Until Germany shall have attained a balanced economy and until the sums referred to in paragraphs 13 and 14 above have been repaid to the occupying powers, Germany will not be called upon to make any reparation deliveries from current production or stocks.17. The appropriate German Central Administration shall present for theapproval of the occupying Powers proposals for financial reform in Germany.The aim of these proposals shall be to place on a sound basis the German currency,the systems of taxation and banking, the national debt and the wage and price levels, to diminish the danger of inflation which arises from the present excessof purchasing power, and to provide for an equitable sharing among&apos; the Germanpeople of the financial burdens of the war and its aftermath.18. The appropriate German authorities shall put forward as soon aspossible for Allied approval proposals in regard to the breaking up of concen-trations of economic power as exemplified by cartels, syndicates, trusts and othermonopolistic arrangements. Proposals to socialise certain industries will be taken&apos;into consideration by the occupying Powers and regarded by them as one methodof carrying out this provision.C. Reparations19. The Controlling Powers confirm the Potsdam Agreement on Repara-tions. Since, however, the determination of the amount of equipment to beremoved from the Western Zones on account of reparation was agreed upon onlysubject to certain assumptions, not all of which have been fulfilled, a freshdetermination will be made by the Control Council not later than 1st July, 1947,and not later than 15th August, 1947, the Council will issue a final list of the plant and equipment to be removed from Germany. Germany will be left with sufficient capacity to produce annually 10 million ingot tons of steel and this willalso be the permissible production of steel in Germany. Other limits on the capacity to be left in Germany of other restricted industries will be subject to
similar upward adjustment. The Controlling Powers will co-operate inexpediting the delivery to the recipient countries of the plant and equipment tobe removed from Germany.20. Any Allied Power which acquires, by way of reparation (or otherwise),title to the German ownership interest in an enterprise located in Germany shallpossess all the rights pertaining under German law to the ownership interestso acquired and such enterprise and the ownership interest shall be subject inall respects to German law. Enterprises in which any ownership interest is sotransferred shall remain a part of the economic resources of Germany.Qth February, 1947.APPENDIX &quot; B &quot;Economic Problems in GermanyPart I. Historical1. There are three main issues on which we have failed to reach agreementwith the Russians and with which the conversations in Moscow will be primarily concerned. These are economic unity, level of industry and reparations, all threebeing closely interdependent.  The background of these problems is as follows: :--Economic Unity2. It was agreed at Potsdam that Germany should be treated as a singleeconomic unit; that the indigenous resources of the country should be equitablydistributed throughout the zones with a view to achieving a common rationstandard; and that the proceeds of all exports from current production and stocks should be used in the first place to meet essential imports. The Agreementalso provided that Allied control should be imposed upon the German economy to the extent necessary to ensure the production and maintenance of goods and services required to meet the needs of the occupation forces and displaced persons in Germany. With a view to achieving economic unity, central Germanadministrative agencies were to be established under State Secretaries in the fields of finance, transport, communications, foreign trade and industry.3. So far, it has not been possible to carry out any of these provisions. TheFrench who adhered to Potsdam only after its signature by the three powers have until recently set themselves rigidly against the establishment of central german &apos; administrative agencies, maintaining that this is contrary to the expressed intention of the Controlling Powers to decentralise Germany&apos;s politicaland economic structure. They have, however, now agreed to the creation of centralagencies in the most important of which the executive work is carried out byGermans under the supervision of the four Powers and with representatives ofthe four Powers in key positions. The Russians have paid lip-service to theprinciple of central German administrations, but have given clear indication oftheir unwillingness to&apos; allow these agencies to exercise direct authority oversubordinate bodies in the Russian Zone. It is very doubtful whether they would allow four-Power Inspectorates to supplant the Soviet Military administration in the supervision of the Agencies&apos; work in the Soviet Zone. Both we and the americans have consistently pressed for the establishment of Central Administra-tions, but both of us have stipulated that these must be part of a general agree-ment under which all the terms of Potsdam are implemented.4. In making this proviso we have been particularly concerned over theRussian policy of taking current reparation deliveries from the Russian Zone.This is a flagrant breach of the Potsdam Agreement since no current deliveriescan be made until Germany is able not only to pay for her essential importsbut also to repay the monies already advanced on account of imported supplies for the population of Germany and in respect of external costs of occupation.After the meeting of the Council of Foreign ministers last July I circulated a paper demanding the adherence of all four Powers to this essential clause of the potsdam Agreement, and stated, that unless the occupying Powers were preparedto agree to this proposal I should have no other option but to operate the british zone as a separate unit with a view to relieving the burden on the British taxpayerat the earliest possible moment. It was this proposal which actuated Mr. Byrnes&apos;sfusion offer.   Both this offer and my proposal were flatly turned down by the
Russians and, with some reluctance, by the French. We, as my colleagues are aware, finally decided to accept the Byrnes&apos; proposal, and the two Western Zonesare now, as a result of the agreement in America last December, being run as asingle economic unit.Level of industry. So far as the Level of Industry is concerned, it was agreed at Potsdamthat Germany should be allowed to enjoy the average standard of living of all european countries other than the U.S.S.R. and the United Kingdom, and thatplant and equipment surplus to that required to maintain this standard shouldbe removed as repajations. The responsibility of determining what level ofGerman industry would be required to support this standard was referred tothe Control Council in Berlin and after several months of nego-tiatidn an agreement was signed in March 1946 known as the Levelof Industry Plan. In the course of the negotiations we foundourselves faced with a ruthless deindustrialisation policy on the part of theRussians in which they received a considerable measure of support from,the French. The Americans, though less drastic in their outlook, wished toreduce German industry considerably more than we felt was desirable, and finally, under strong American pressure to reach a unanimous decision, we accepted the Plan, though with nuxch,misgiving. In accepting it, however, westipulated that if Germany were not treated as a single economic unit, if herwestern boundaries were altered, or if the assumption on which the plan was based, that German goods found a ready sale in world export markets, provedfalse, the Plan would have to be subject to revision. We also insisted that if thenumber of the population of Germany turned out to be different from the figurewe had assumed, some adjustment would have to take place.6. As already mentioned, Germany has not been treated as a single economic unit and although no decision has yet been taken on Germany&apos;s western frontiers,the French have taken unilateral action which is equivalent to the politicalseparation of the Saar from the rest of Germany. The Plan is therefore subjectto revision and, if we are to reduce the cost to the British taxpayer and recoverany part of the expenditure we have already incurred in supplying Germanymid maintaining our occupation forces, a substantial upward revision will benecessary. There is another and equally important reason for this. The Levelof Industry Plan was worked out on the assumption that no further dismantlingin any of the four zones would take place except on the basis of an agreed plan&apos;,and, in particular, that there would be no further removal of plant from peacefulindustries. Notwithstanding this understanding, the Russians have carried outextensive further removals in peaceful industries which are vital to Germanyif she is to achieve a balance of payments. I refer in particular to the textile and paper industries.7. I do not ask my colleagues at this stage to decide on what exactly thelevel of industry should be since that is a matter which can only he worked outin Germany where all the facts are available. I do however feel that we should try and give some shape to the Plan by deciding now on the level of German steel production to which her engineering industries will have to be correspondinglygeared. It was on the question of steel capacity that we encountered most ofthe disagreement in our negotiation on the old Level of Industry Plan and thefigure which was finally fixed, namely 1\ million tons, capacity was in my opiniondecidedly too low. I have had the question of German steel requirementscarefully examined by experts who recommend that Germany should be permittedan annual production of 10 million tons and. sufficient capacity to ensure thisoutput; this is the figure on which I would like authority to seek agreement in moscow.Reparations8. The Potsdam Agreement provided that Russia would obtain her share of reparations out of the surplus plant and equipment in her own zone and wouldalso be entitled to receive 25 per cent, of the plant and equipment in the WesternZone. Out of this share she would satisfy the demands of Poland. The remainingcapital equipment removed from the Western Zones would be distributed amongstthe other reparation claimant Powers. Of the 25 per cent, of surplus plant andequipment from the Western Zones which goes to Russia, 10 per cent, is delivered[33188] c
free and the balance of 15 per cent, against deliveries of commodities to acorresponding value by the Russians over a period of five years. Prior to the signature of the Level of Industry Plan certain plants were declared surplus inthe Western Zones as advance deliveries, and these were allocated to the control council in Berlin as between Russia and Poland on the one hand and the I.A.E.APowers on the other. Shortly after the Level of Industry Plan was signed thequestion of economic unity came up for discussion in Berlin and in the absence of four-Power agreement the Americans refused to allocate or dismantle any furtherplants. Although we have never formally followed the American lead in tinsrespect the refusal of the Americans to join in Quadripartite valuation hasaffected deliveries from our Zone in the same way. As a result there has been agood deal of complaint from the I.A.R.A. Powers that their reconstructionprogrammes are being retarded. As is our own. Until quite recently, therefore,reparation deliveries have virtually come to a standstill although a quadripartitestudy has been made of the plants in many industries which under the Level ofIndustry Plan would be surplus to Germany&apos;s peacetime needs and thereforeavailable as reparation deliveries. To meet this situation the British Commandev-in-Chief announced last November his intention of making available forimmediate delivery R.M. 100 million of non-unique items of plant and equipment from the British Zone and the French have recently followed suit in their zone upto an amount of R.M. 15 million. The Americans while criticising our action in public have let it be known to us in private that they understand the reasons whichprompted it. The Russians have protested strongly and have refused lotake the 25 per cent, participation in these deliveries to which they are entitled.More recently the Americans have announced their intention of makingimmediately available as reparations the special and general purpose plant inthe war factories in their Zone.   We have followed suit.9. The above measures are clearly only palliatives and do not strike at the root of the reparation problem. All the I.A.R.A. Powers need plant for recon-struction purposes. In the case of the United Kingdom, if we do not get it weshall be involved in heavy dollar expenditure or be forced to reduce our programmeof modernisation. Proposals for dealing with this problem were recently putforward in a paper by the Economic and Industrial Planning Staffwhich I submitted to the Overseas Reconstruction Committee (O.R.C. (47) 3).Briefly, they were that we should inform the Americans that while we were pre-pared to hold our hand in regard to the continuation of general reparation deliveries until after the Moscow discussions had taken place we had everyintention of seeing that thereafter sufficient plants were declared, surplus to meetthe urgent needs of ourselves and the other Western reparation claimant Powersplus an appropriate allocation to Russia,. If it was not possible to do this bygeneral agreement we should have to resort to unilateral action in our own Zone.In the meantime, in order to get deliveries going we should get the americans to agree to a wider definition of the words &quot; war plants &quot; which would enable boththem and us to make available under the war plants scheme completed factories in industries which were to be restricted on security grounds. General Robertsonhas been instructed to convey these views of His Majesty&apos;s Government officiallyto General Clay, but so far I have not heard what the American reaction is.10. The Russian attitude towards reparations has been unsatisfactorythroughout. They have attacked us in the Control Council and in the press forfailure to deliver plant and equipment from the Western Zones; they have putobstacles in the way of the I.A.R.A. Powers obtaining from them the counterdeliveries of commodities to which they are entitled against the plant alreadydelivered. In addition, they have, as I have already mentioned, taken largequantities of goods from current production and stocks out of their own Zonenotwithstanding the fact that this is contrary to the terms of the PotsdamAgreement.Part II. Present Attitude of the Controlling Powers and of the GermansThe Russian A ttitude11. Russian economic and political policies in Germany have been to aconsiderable extent contradictory. They have been pursued simultaneously, but now one and now the other had been predominant. In the first few months afterthe German surrender, the Russians pursued a ruthless policy of dismantlingand removing the principal industries in their own zone.   Then in spring 1946.
political considerations became predominant. The Russians substantiallymodified their de-industrialisation policy and set out to organise their Zonepolitically. To this end they forced through in their own Zone compulsoryamalgamation of the Communist and. Social Democrat parties which became thenew United Workers&apos; Party. Until after the Berlin municipal elections last october when the &quot;Socialist Unity Party&quot; was soundly defeated, polling only19-5 per cent, of the votes against 48-8 per cent by the S.D.P. and 23-3 per cent,by the C.D.U., the Russians did not openly pursue their policy of gettingmaximum economic gain from their Zone. The S.E.D&apos;s failure was followed by anew wave of dismantling. Many plants which were clearly of a non-warlikecharacter were dismantled and shipped to Russia,, a number of German companies were transferred to Russian ownership and in October 1946 several thousandworkers were rounded up and deportee! to Russia. This latter action led to animmediate protest in the Control Council which had the effect of bringingdeportations, at least for the time being, to a halt. Throughout this periodRussian occupation forces were living off the land and a large proportion of current production was being sent back to Russia by way of reparation deliveries.Since the New York discussions in December the Russians have changed theirpolicy once again and now appear to be having another attempt at gainingGerman sympathy. They have announced a programme for their own Zonewhich sets a limit on the removals of plant and equipment for reparation purposes and holds out to the Germans prospects of expansion in the peaceful domesticindustries limited only by German resources of materials and manpower. Simul-taneously with this development they have started a full scale offensive in theRussian press and. in the Russian-controlled press in their Zone against theeconomic fusion of the British and American Zones. This is given the appear-ance of a vast capitalistic ramp aimed at the financial enslavement of western germany which is to be deliberately dismembered from the rest of the countryfor incorporation in a Western European bloc.12. In conversations with. General Clay and General Robertson. MarshalSokolovsky has indicated that Russia is anxious for economic unity; that shewill be willing to see an upward revision of the Level of Industry Plan; thatshe intends to continue to take reparation deliveries from her own Zone andwould expect as a quid pro quo for agreeing an upward revision of the Level ofIndustry Plan a share of current deliveries from Western Germany. She hasprofessed a willingness to see Central German Administrative Agencies estab-lished in accordance with the terms of the Potsdam Agreement, but her actionssuggest that she does not intend to allow such an arrangement to interfere withthe direct control exercised by the Russian Commander-in-Chief over Germanadministrative bodies in the Russian Zone. In the political field she has notdisclosed her hand entirely, but it seems certain that she is opposed to carryingvery far the policy of decentralisation agreed to at Potsdam and would certainlyoppose a future German constitution on federal lines. More recently she hasdisclosed her attitude to the Ruhr in the obvious!)&apos; inspired papers put in bythe Ukrainian and Byelo-Russian Governments to the Deputies for Germany.Both of these Governments have demanded that the Ruhr should be taken outof tire British Zone of occupation and set up as a Central Komm an datura,presumably operating under the control of the Control Council.13. From the long-term point of view Russia&apos;?, aims in regard to germany can be defined as the creation of a unitary Germany with a strong CentralGovernment; the de-industrialisation of Germany to a point where she can nolonger be a threat to Russia; participation in an international control to be setup for the Ruhr so.as to prevent Western Germany being controlled solely by theWestern Powers; and the extraction of reparation deliveries to the amount of$10 billion, which is the figure that the Russians originally put forward at Yalta,and which could only be attained by large-scale deliveries of plant, equipment and manufactures from the Western Zones.The French attitude14. The French, though not present at Potsdam, have in general subscribedto the terms of the Potsdam Agreement with one exception. They have until recently consistently opposed the principle of establishing German CentralAdministrative Agencies on the grounds that these will inevitably lead to theformation of a strong central German Government, and even now their viewof the function of central agencies differs considerably from our own. Politicallythey favour a, confederation of German States and wish the Ruhr to be separated[33188] c 2
from the rest of Germany. They have proposed a long term military occupationof the West bank of the Rhine, the occupying forces being drawn from thelimitrophe States and inter-Allied occupation and control of the Ruhr. they propose that British- troops should be included in the Ruhr occupation forcesbut have not so far disclosed their hand on the question of Russian or Americanparticipation. As regards the Ruhr industries they foresee international owner-ship and management of the coal, iron and steel industries, though the profitsfrom these industries would be retained by the Germans. For the chemical and engineering industries they propose a rather looser form of control with owner-ship remaining in German hands. They have already taken steps to separate the Saar from the rest of Germany and intend this area to be set up as a separateterritory with a customs and currency union with France. In the fields of reparations and level of industry they wish to see a Germany which isindustrially weak and attach particular importance to her steel consumptionbeing no higher than 1\ million tons provided for in the Level of Industry Plan,of which 1-J- million tons would be derived from the Saar. They have undoubtedlytaken stocks-: and current production out of their own Zone which they have not-paid for. We have been told unofficially that they intend to account for thesedeliveries in due course but whether they in fact do so remains to be seen. Ingeneral, their attitude is to extract from Germany by way of reparations asmuch as they can.15. From the long-term point of view the French aims in regard to germany can therefore be defined as the creation of a politically weak Confederate Statedeprived of the resources both of the Ruhr and the Saar and with an industrial capacity only just sufficient to maintain a moderate standard of living. HerWestern frontiers would be occupied for an indefinite period with a view toremoving the least vestige of any threat of future aggression.The American point of view18. The Americans wish to see the terms of the Potsdam Agreement fullyimplemented, particularly in regard to economic unity and the establishment of central Administrations. They attach particular importance to the freedomof movement of persons, goods and ideas across the zonal boundaries and the role of the occupying Powers being relegated to that of an inspectorate with adequate military backing. Their views with regard to the Level of IndustryPlan are not clear. On the one hand they appear to regard any further substantialremovals of plant and equipment from the Western Zones as unlikely in theevent of a break with Russia involving the temporary separation of Western and.Eastern Germany; on the other, they appear to be ready to support the Levelof Industry Plan in its present form if the other terms of Potsdam were fullyimplemented. Their official attitude seems to be that some upward adjustment of the Level of Industry Plan may be necessary but perhaps only in order toenable Germany to make current reparation deliveries. At the same time theyare much concerned at the cost of occupation to the American taxpayer and takethe stand that no current deliveries should be made until these costs have beenrecovered. In. practice it seems probable that they will pursue a middle course,namely, agree to moderate current deliveries in exchange for Russian agreement on the other Potsdam principles and at the same time increase the level ofindustry to a greater extent than would be necessitated by these cur-rentreparation deliveries alone. In. any upward revision of the Level of industryPlan it seems unlikely that they will be prepared to raise steel capacity muchabove the 7\ million ton level.17. So far as long-term policy is concerned, their aims can be defined asthe creation of a Federal Germany, with her frontiers substantially unchangedin the West, except for the cession of the Saar to the French. As regards theEast, their attitude on the cession of all the territory now administered by theRussians and Poles is not quite clear. The industrial capacity of the country should be fixed, at a level sufficient to ensure a reasonable standard of living;cartels and other similar arrangements which tend to operate in restraint oftrade would be dissolved and industry for the most part would be left in the handsof private enterprise.The German view18. With practically no exception the Germans desire above all things the unity of the country. This is based partly on historical grounds and partly onthe erroneous belief &quot;that if the resources of the Russian Zone were freely available
to the West an immediate improvement in the standard of living would result.Both the Social Democratic and Communist Parties are in favour of a strong-central Government. Certain elements in Christian Democrat and Right-wingParties are more ready to accept a system which gave greater powers to theLander. Almost ah Germans are united in their opposition to the loss or cession of any further territory and there is undoubtedly a strong irredentist feelingtowards areas ceded to Poland and Russia in the East. In the economic fieldthere is a great antagonism to the policy of dismantling plant and equipment and a desire at least to know as soon as possible where they stand in this matter.In Western Germany, particularly the more industrialised parts of the british zone, the economic difficulties of the last eighteen months have brought about astate, of depression and indifference. The Germans are becoming increasinglyinclined to lay at the cloor of the occupying Powers the blame for their presentplight. The absence of any solution or immediate prospect of a solution for theeconomic crisis is already driving some more politically-minded Germans toadopt extreme political views. There can be little doubt that present conditionsare favourable to the spread of Communist doctrine and that the Russians are well aware of their opportunities and there are already signs that they areexploiting them.The British View19.   British policy is to a large degree similar to that of the United States.It differs from it. however, in the following respects : (i) We are not prepared to make concessions for the sake of achievingeconomic unity which would involve us in any additional financial commitment over and above that to which we are already committedunder the fusion agreement with the United States,(ii) We go further than the Americans, particularly in the case of steel,as regards the level of industrial capacity which Germany needs tobecome self-supporting,(iii) We feel that it is essential that Germany&apos;s basic industries should besocialised and not be allowed once again to be controlled by private interests even if those interests are decartelised.Our position  in  regard to these three problems can be summarised asfollows : Current Reparations20. In one important respect our position in Germany is different fromthat of either France, Russia, or the United. States. Neither the Russian.northe French zones of occupation is involving the two occupying Powers concernedin any financial commitment; Russia, indeed, is making money out of her zonethrough her policy of taking reparation deliveries from current production,while the French at worst are breaking even and at best have a small, favourable balance. Although the United States are sharing equally with us the deficit ofthe combined zones the cost to them is relatively insignificant compared with thecost to the United Kingdom. Moreover, since the bulk of German imports atpresent consist of foodstuffs which must be derived, at least for the time being,from dollar sources of supply, the occupation of Germany constitutes a realthreat to the dollar resources of the United Kingdom. For this reason onestandard by which we are bound to measure the policy advocated towards germany at Moscow is whether it would cost us more or less than our presentoccupation commitment. Current reparation deliveries from all four zones would clearly cost us more. It would be impossible to agree to Russia taking currentdeliveries from the Western Zones without extending the same rights to theY/estern reparation claimant Powers, including ourselves, who are entitled toreceive three times the Russian share. These current reparation deliveries would reduce the volume of commercial exports and render it even more difficult to finda marl-ret for the latter.21. Economic unity with no current reparation deliveries would, indeed, p rob-ably cost us more than a continuation of the present arrangements whereby goods from the combined zones are only delivered to the other zones in exchange for goods or cash of an equivalent value. It is true that the food resources of theEastern Zone are greater than those of the west, and that given a common rationscale throughout the country of, say, 1,800 calories per day, certain food surplusesshould be available from the east&apos;; on the other hand, from the little we know
about the Russian zone, it appears that her industrial capacity has been reduced below the level necessary to render that area self-supporting, and that thosefactories which have been left are being seriously overdriven with insufficientattention paid to the maintenance of their capital equipment. Thus, if thezones were thrown open the industrial products of the West would flow Eastwhile, judging from Russian policy in other parts of Europe, and in her ownzone hitherto, there can be no certainty that surpluses from the East would everflow westwards. Although Russia may pay lip-service to the principles ofeconomic unity and the conception of German central administrative agencieshaving real control throughout the whole country, the very existence of a soviet military Administration in the East would make it difficult for us to ensurethat the Russians were living up to their bargain. If they failed to do soindustrial goods from the what might easily pa,ss into the Russian Zone and beyond it into Russia, and Russia would have succeeded in having her cakeand eating it as well, i.e., in getting current reparation deliveries from the Westin exchange for an empty offer of unity.22. For these reasons I feel that besides opposing current reparation deliveries we must also make it a condition of economic unity that Russia andFrance should share with us and the Americans in the deficit financing ofGermany, including the liabilities already incurred. What this share should berequires careful consideration. It would be logical for Russia to accept a portionequal to the benefit which she derives from the reparation agreement. At Yalta,and later at Moscow, she claimed that she was entitled to 50 per cent., and thereparation agreement signed at Potsdam recognises this claim; she should, there-fore, be asked to accept a similar share of the deficit financing. This need not,however, be regarded as a hard-and-fast formula, and I should be content if she were to accept a share equivalent, to the proportion of the population of herzone to the total population of Germany.23. Although, for the reasons I have stated, we must take a firm stand against current reparation deliveries being made until Germany has becomeself-supporting and has rejoaid all the sums for which she is liable on accountof imported supplies for the German population and of the external costs ofoccupation, we must consider what our attitude should be towards current repara-tion deliveries after these repayments have been made. A large number of theAllied countries in the papers which they have submitted to the Deputies on germany have included in their claims on Germany claims for current reparation deliveries. The Western European countries recognise that these claims can onlybe met at the cost of the occupying Powers, and for this reason probably do not expect them to be considered seriously, at any rate at present. But to informthese countries that they will never at. any stage obtain current reparation deliveries from Germany is an entirely different matter, and if we were to adoptsuch a policy it would raise strong protests from the Western and eastern european countries alike. Germany&apos;s commitments to ourselves and the UnitedStates are very considerable, and even if we succeed, in getting our money backit will take us a long time to do so. I should, therefore, be reluctant to cometo any final decision at this stage as to the quantity of reparation deliveriesthat Germany must eventually make from current production or the period over which such deliveries should be made. Instead, I should prefer to agree a general statement to the effect that when Germany&apos;s obligations to the occupying powers have been fully satisfied and when Germany has achieved a favourable export-import balance, the occupying Powers, in consultation with the other Allies, will consider what further reparation payments Germany should make.Level of Industry24:. With regard to the future level of German industry I am convincedthat the capacity agreedl under the Level of Industry Plan is not sufficient toprovide both for a reasonable standard of living for the Germans and for the repayment of past and present indebtedness on account of civilian imports and external occupation costs. I think we must press most strongly for its upwardrevision, irrespective of whether or not when these costs have been repaid,current deliveries are to be allowed over a limited period. In particular weshould ensure that the level of German steel industry is substantially increased.During my conversation with Mr. Byrnes in New York last December, GeneralClay stated that in his view as high a figure as 11 million tons which I mentionedin the Foreign Affairs Debate on 28th October would be danger to security.   I
IShave now after expert advice, revised this figure downwards to 10 million tons.I am satisfied that this level does not constitute a clanger to security and I donot think that we should go below it.25. In connexion with this problem there is one other point to which Ishould draw attention. The Russians, as I have already mentioned, have taken over in their own zone a number of German factories and are claiming extra-territorial rights in respect of the operation of those factories. It is clearly ofo-reat importance that this practice should cease and that whatever industryfs left to Germany should be subject to German law, the foreign owners of suchenterprises receiving no preferential treatment over the owners of German enter-prises except in so far that some arrangement will be necessary to permit of the eventual transfer of dividends across the exchanges.Socialisation of Industry26. The financial devastation caused by the war and by our reparation policycalls for drastic financial reform in Germany, involving the redistribution of thecanital wealth of the country as evenly as possible over the whole community.To allow the basic industries of the country to remain in private hands would clearly involve great inequalities in the treatment of the various sections of thecommunity and would certainly lay us open to charges of supporting thereactionary elements in the country.27. There can. I think, be no doubt that in view of the extraordinarilydifficult economic conditions in Germany our declared policy of socialisation isthe only sound and practical one. Our plans would only raise contentious pointsbetween the Americans and ourselves if we forced them through regardless ofGerman opinion. It may be remarked that in the American Zone the constitutionscf the Lander make provision for public ownership of certain industries in the British Zone serious. German opposition is in my view unlikely to arise,although of late there have been signs of the S.P.D., which has always favoured the principle of socialisation, criticising our execution of the policy.28. The C.D.U., however, of which certain Right-Wing elements onceappeared likely to oppose socialisation and to carry the party^ with them, hasrecently bowed to the views of its Left Wing and declared itself in favour ofa considerable measure of socialisation. On 3rd February a conference of theCD.IT. Leaders in the British Zone agreed, upon a party economic programme in which one of the eight points was that the iron and steel industries should be nationalised. We can thus, in my view, rely upon a vigorously executed socialisa-tion policy meeting with the approval of the majority of Germans.29. An additional conqDlication has recently been raised by the objectionsto our programme lodged by the Western Allies. The Allies&apos;object that weare placing too much economic power in the hands of Germans, and particularlythat we are placing Allied property in German hands. It is, however, to be hoped that they can be met without a radical change of policy on our part.
