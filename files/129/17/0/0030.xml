THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY  OP  HIS  BRITANNIC  majesty&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1947SECRETCP. (47) 8012*A March, 1947Copy No.    gCABINETRESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CARE OF DEPRIVED CHILDRENMemorandum by the Lord Privy SealIntroductory1. On 15th November the Prime Minister appointed a Ministerial Com-mittee under the chairmanship* of the Lord President of the Council to considerthe recommendations contained in the Curtis and Clyde Reports (Cmd. 6922 and6911) with a view to an early statement of the Governments attitude on the main questions of policy raised by these recommendations.2. The principal recommendation made by both the Curtis Committee andthe Clyde Committee was that central responsibility for the care of deprived children should be concentrated in a single Department and we all agree thatthis recommendation should be accepted. In accordance with their instructionsthe Committees refrained from suggesting which Department should be made responsible, and the main task facing us was to consider whether in Englandand Wales responsibility should be concentrated in the Home Office, the Ministryof Education or the Ministry of Health.3. The Home Secretary and the late Minister of Education submittedmemoranda to the Committee arguing in favour of concentrating responsibility in the Home Office and the Ministry of Education respectively; and the Ministryof Health circulated a memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Health setting out the case for making the Ministry of Healthresponsible. Therefore, at a meeting of the Committee, the Ministers concerned were able to supplement the arguments in these papers and the Committee were informed of the provisional views formed by the Secretary of State for scotland on the arrangements to be made in that country.4. The Lord President of the Council, the Chancellor of the Exchequerand I have reached the conclusion that we can best help the Cabinet to reach decisions on the main questions of policy raised by the Curtis and Clyde Reportsif we present to it the views which we ourselves have formed after consideringthe papers circulated to the Committee and hearing the arguments advanced bythe other members of the Committee. We have accordingly set forth our views in the remaining paragraphs of this memorandum. The memorandum has been shown to the other members of the Committee, but they are not committed to its conclusions and have reserved the right to express their own points of view tothe Cabinet.Central Responsibility in England and Wales5. Our view is that central Responsibility in England and Wales should be concentrated in the Home Office. The main reasons for this are: (a) The primary need of the deprived child is a substitute for a normal homelife and the function of the Central Department is to see that, as far as practic-abie, he gets this. The provision of a substitute home is additional to and distinct from the provision of health services or education.* The other members of the Committee were the Lord Privy Seal, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of education and the Minister of Health.[33294] b
(6) The essence of providing a home for a child is to treat the child as an individual, and the need for this is stressed throughout the Curtis Report. TheHome Office staff, both by tradition and by the nature of their work and training,are well qualified to deal with the problems connected with the care of deprived children from the point of view of the individual.(c) The Children&apos;s Branch of the Home Office have always had a general responsibility for furthering the welfare of children in all respects not the specialist concern of other Departments. Thus, among other matters, it has been responsible for guardianship of infants, adoption, inspection of voluntary homes and employment of young persons, all of which are unconnected with delinquency.Nor are its responsibilities in relation to Juvenile Courts entirely concerned withdelinquency as such, since all children who for any cause are brought before aJuvenile Court come within the Home Office sphere of responsibility. It is, infact, often mere accident that determines whether a child is brought before aJuvenile Court as an offender or as in need of care and protection, and the Courtdeals with him not according to what he has done but according to what he needs.There is, therefore, no foundation for the suggestion that to make the HomeOffice the Department responsible for deprived children would mean putting suchchildren under the care of a Department primarily concerned with delinquency.(d) Although the Curtis Committee, in accordance with their instructions,made no recommendation on the matter, their Report is consonant with the viewthat responsibility should be given to the Home Office. In particular, para-graph 434 of the Report (see Annex I) suggests that they did not contemplate that central responsibility would be conferred on either the Ministry of health or the Ministry of Education.(e) The assignment of responsibility for deprived children to a Departmentother than the Home Office would have indirect disadvantages, since it wouldinvolve the transfer from the Home Office not only of their responsibilities for voluntary homes, guardianship of infants, &amp;o, but also of their functions relatingto approved schools and remand homes. It would be administratively extremelydifficult to divorce these functions from those relating to Juvenile Courts andProbation, and the transfer would do a disservice to the cause of penal reform,progress in which has in the past frequently come about as a result of successfulinnovations in the institutions concerned with children and young persons forwhich the Home Office are responsible.6. We considered fully the arguments advanced in favour of assigningresponsibility to the Ministry of Education or to the Ministry of Health and wethink it right that the Cabinet should be aware of these arguments and of thereasons which have led us to reject them.7. The arguments put forward for making the Ministry of Educationresponsible were : (a) Education is no longer a specialised service concerned mainly with mentaltraining, and the Ministry of Education and the local education authorities arenow responsible for securing that each child gets opportunities to develop the bestin him in character and in body as well as in mind. Thus the Ministry and thelocal education authorities have been concerned with such developments ias theschool medical service, child guidance clinics, youth clubs, vocational guidancecontacts with parents and children&apos;s homes; and they have responsibilities and experience in the running of children&apos;s homes and boarding schools.We agree that this is true; in our view, however, it does not meet the pointmade at paragraph 5 (a) above. Parents still have responsibilities for their children complementary to and separate from those of the education authorities.(b) It was suggested that it should be an objective of policy to ensure thatdeprived children are not treated as a class apart and that this would be bestsecured by putting them under the care of the Ministry of Education and thelocal education authorities and so absorbing them into a service which dealswith children generally and removing them from all connection with theworkhouse or prison.We agree that the aim should be to avoid, so far as possible, segregatingdeprived children from other children. But we do not accept the argument that to make the care of deprived children part of the educational service wouldinvolve less segregation than the arrangements which we propose. In so far asinstitutions for children survive under the new policy, the children in these institutions must be to some extent segregated from others, and even in the caseof children boarded out with foster parents the arrangements for supervisionwill inevitably mark them as different from children living with their natural
3174parents, whichever Department is responsible. On the other hand, if the care of deprived children, who form only a small part of the total child populationwere made a part of the education service, the responsible authorities, with theirman&quot; other preoccupations, might well fail to give deprived children as full ameasure of individual attention as they require.(c) It was argued that His Majesty&apos;s Inspectors of Schools constituted amuch larger field staff to undertake the supervision of the arrangements madefor deprived children than was at the disposal of the Home Office; and that,being located throughout the country, they were in a better position to main-tain local contacts. It was also urged thai these Inspectors had long experience in supervising living conditions through their work in inspecting boardingschools and that the Ministry of Education must in any case be responsible forinspecting in those institutions which are of the nature of residential schoolsnot only the schoolroom work but also the living and feeding conditions.In our view the qualifications required for inspecting the domiciliaryarrangements made for deprived children are not the same as those requiredfor an educational inspectorate, even with the present wide conception of educa-tion. We are satisfied that the members of the present Home Office inspectorateare well qualified for the task of seeing that an adequate substitute for parentalcare is provided and that this inspectorate could be expanded to enable the widerresponsibilities which we propose that the Home Office should undertake to be discharged. At the same time we agree that the education of deprived children,including those in residential institutions, should be the responsibility of theMinistry of Education and that arrangements should be made for His Majesty&apos;sInspectors of Schools to inspect the educational side of homes for deprived children.(d) It was admitted that assignment of responsibility for deprived children to the Ministry of Education would involve the transfer from the Home Officeof responsibility for approved schools and remand homes, but it was argued thatthis was right on merits.In our view to transfer responsibility for approved schools and remandhomes to the Ministry of Education would merely continue in another form thedivided responsibility which the Government are already pledged to abolish.The Home Office could not relinquish responsibility for Juvenile Courts andthe probation service and they would be bound to continue to be concerned withthe administration of approved schools and of remand homes. (See also paragraph 5 (e) above.)8.   The arguments advanced on behalf of the Ministry of Health were :- *(a) In order to avoid the segregation of deprived children from other children, the function of caring for them should be assigned to the authorities responsible for the maternity and child welfare service, the health visitor serviceand the expanded services for handicapped persons.In principle this argument seems to us to be similar to that put forward on behalf of the Ministry of Education at paragraph 7 (6) above and we feelthat it does not meet the essential point that the need of the deprived child isfor a substitute for what the normal child gets from his parents.(&amp;) It was suggested that the Ministry of Health had acquired special experience in oaring for deprived children as a result of their responsibilityfor the war-time evacuation schemes.On this point we would merely observe that the experience of the Ministryof Health is very short compared with that of the Home Office, which goes, back for more than 50 years.9. Apart from the positive arguments for the assignment of responsibility to the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Health, it was represented to us that a decision to make the Home Office responsible would be unpopular with localauthorities, who would prefer to deal with the Ministry of Health or the Ministryof Education, and with women&apos;s organisations, who would regard the decisions as tantamouunt to entrusting the care of deprived children to the police.We do not believe that the views of local authorities in this matter are primarily influenced by regard for the needs of the children concerned and theyshould not, in our view, weigh with the Government in the face of the administra-tive arguments which we have set out in paragraph 5 above.As regards the views of women&apos;s organisations, it must be recognised thatthe assignment of responsibility to a Department other than the Home office would not prevent cases involving deprived children from coming before the[33294] B 2
Courts, since a Court Order will always be necessary before a child can be taken from his parents. And when a case has come before the Courts, the police andthe probation service are inevitably brought in. Nevertheless, we recognise thata decision to assign responsibility to the Home Office is capable of misunder-standing and we therefore think that the announcement of the decision shouldbe so framed as to rebut the suggestion that deprived children are being handedover to the police and should stress the following points : (a) The transfer of responsibility to the Home Office will be made theoccasion for the creation of a new and enlarged Children&apos;s Branch devotedprimarily to the task of seeing that a. suitable home background is piwided forall deprived children.(b) Delinquent children for whom it is necessary to provide substitutehomes will be treated as an incidental section of the larger class of deprived children.(c) Arrangements will be made for a regular system of consultation betweenthe Home Office and the Ministries of Education and Health on the services to be provided for the education and health of deprived children and for the supervision of these services.Central Responsibility in Scotland10. We were informed that the Secretary of State for Scotland was inclined to think that central responsibility for deprived children in Scotland shouldbe assigned to the Scottish Education Department, but that before formulating&apos;a final view on this matter he wished to consider the decision of the Cabinet withregard to England and Wales. The fact that the Scottish Education, health and Home Departments are all under the Secretary of State and housed in thesame building in Edinburgh distinguishes the Scottish position from that inEngland and Wales : but the same reasons which have led us to propose the assignment of responsibility to the Home Office in England and Wales disposeus to favour the assignment of responsibility in Scotland to the Scottish home department.Local Arrangements in England and Wales11.   There is general agreement with the recommendation in the CurtisReport that locally the county and county borough councils should be responsiblefor the care of deprived children.   As regards the arrangements for dischargingthis responsibility, the Report recommended that the councils should act throughad hoc children&apos;s committees which should contain members experienced in thework of the public assistance, public health and education committees, but shouldnot be in any way representative of or subordinate to these committees.   Thelate Minister of Education, as part of her proposals for dealing with deprived children through the education service, proposed to us that instead of an indepen-dent children&apos;s committee, there should be a special children&apos;s sub-committeeof the education committee with representatives of the maternity and child welfare committee, while the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Heatlhsuggested that the work should be done by a sub-committee appointed jointlyby the maternity and child welfare and educational committees.   Our own view is that in most areas the right solution will be to have an ad hoc children&apos;scommittee at least for a period of three years.   We have come to this conclusionfor very much the same reasons as have led us to propose that central responsibility should be assigned to the Home Office.   The local authority, as the Curtis andClyde Committees both emphasise have a general parental responsibility towardsthe homeless children in their care; and we agree with the committees in thinking that this can best be discharged by a body other than one whose main concernis with the specialist services provided by the local authorities for all the children in its area.   The appointment of a special committee should give a stimulus tothe work of improving the local arrangements for those aspects of the care ofdeprived children which go beyond the normal province of the usual localauthority committees.   At the same time we think that it would be right to allow for exceptional arrangements in particular areas.   We accordingly recommendthat each council should be required to draw up and submit to the HomeSecretary a scheme setting out the proposed arrangements for local administra-tion, and that it should be understood that, save in exceptional circumstances, thescheme should provide for the discharge of the council&apos;s functions relating todeprived children through an ad hoc children&apos;s committee for a period of at least three years.
12. The Curtis Eeport recommended that there should be in each area afull time executive children&apos;s officer with the standing of an important adminis-trative officer of the council and that in areas where the volume of work wasnot sufficient to justify the appointment of a full time officer of the requisitestanding the councils should combine to set up a joint children&apos;s board with ajoint children&apos;s officer. We endorse the recommendation that there should bein eadh area a children&apos;s officer but we agree with the Home Secretary and theMinister of Health in thinking that in most of the instances where the appcint-ment of a joint children&apos;s officer would be desirable the preferable course willbe simply to provide for a joint appointment in the appropriate schemes of local administration without also providing for a joint children&apos;s board.13. Before approving each scheme of local administration the HomeSecretary would have to be satisfied that the local authority were not merelycontinuing the old system under a new name, but were making a fresh approach to the problem of caring for deprived children and were establishing an organisa-tion which would be adequate to carry out the progressive policy envisaged bythe Curtis Committee. He would also have to see that the schemes provide forproper co-ordination between the children&apos;s committees and the public health and education committees.Local A rrangements in Scotland14 The Clyde Report recommended that locally responsibility should rest with the county councils and town councils of large burghs, and that functionsat present exercised by the education authorities in relation to homeless children should be transferred to these councils. If at the centre administrative responsi-bility is assigned to the Scottish Home Department, this recommendation will doubtless be accepted. In that event, we feel that, as in England and Wales,the looal authorities should be required to submit to the Secretary of State forScotland schemes for the discharge of their functions; that, save in exceptional cases, these schemes should provide, for an initial period of three years, for theappointment of special children&apos;s care committees; and that provision shouldbe made for the appointment by the local authorities concerned, either individuallyor jointly, of children&apos;s officers.Legislation15. The Legislative Programme for the 1946-47 Session makes no provisionfor legislation to implement the recommendations of the Curtis and ClydeReports, and it seems clear that it would be impossible to find parliamentary time for a Bill carrying out a comprehensive overhaul of the law relating todeprived children. The transfer of responsibility from other Ministers to theHome Secretary could be effected by order under the Ministers of the Crown(Transfer of Powers) Act, and in Scotland any transfer from one Department ofthe Secretary of State to another would be a domestic and administrative matter.The assignment of local responsibility to county councils and county borough councils in England and Wales does not involve legislation; but legislation wouldbe required to concentrate local responsibility in the councils of counties and large burghs in Scotland.Until legislation is passed giving the Home Secretary and the Secretary ofState for Scotland power to require local authorities to submit to them schemesfor the administration of their functions relating to deprived children, theGovernment may be criticised on the ground that the reorganisation of -thearrangements for caring for deprived children is being delayed unduly. this criticism could be met if a short Bill covering these points and dealing withthe question of local responsibility in Scotland were passed in the 1946-47Session. But the 1946-47 Legislative Programme is already heavily overloadedand the passage of a short Bill on the lines indicated in the current session would not avoid the need for further legislation in the 1947-48 Session, whensome provision will have to be made for children now cared for under the PoorLaw. This being so we think that the right course is to resist pressure for legis-lation in the 1946-47 Session. The order under the Ministers of the Crown(Transfer of Powers) Act transferring responsibility to the Home secretary should be made as soon as possible, and the Home Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Scotland should at once take up the task of preparing a compre-hensive Bill for introduction during the 1947-48 Session and of carrying out such preliminary work towards the reorganisation of the arrangements for caringfor deprived children (e.g., consultations with local authorities) as can be under-taken before legislation is passed.
Summary16.   We recommend : (1) that central responsibility for the care of deprived children in Englandand Wales should be concentrated in the Home Office;(2) that local responsibility in England and Wales should lie with the county or county borough council and that the arrangements for the dis-charge of their functions relating to deprived children should be laiddown in a scheme submitted by the local council to the Home Secretaryfor approval. Unless in exceptional circumstances the scheme should provide for the discharge of the functions for at least three yearsthrough an ad hoc children&apos;s committee. The scheme should also provide for the appointment of a children&apos;s officer of suitable standing by each council, or, where appropriate, by two or more councils ofadjacent areas. Normally schemes should not provide for the establish-ment of joint children^ boards;(3) that unless there are arguments of which we are not aware which justifythe Government in taking a different line in Scotland, central respon-sibility in that country should be concentrated in the Scottish home department and local responsibility in the councils of counties and large burghs, provision being made, as in England, for administrativeschemes and the appointment of chilclren&apos;s officers;(4) that an order under the Ministers of the Crown (Transfer of Powers)Act transferring responsibility to the Home Secretary should be madeas soon as possible and that the Home Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Scotland should at once take up the preparation of legis-,lation for introduction in the 1947-48 Session, and should meanwhilecarry out such preliminary work towards the reorganisation of thearrangements for the care of deprived children as can be undertakenbefore legislation is passed.an announcement of the Governments intentions should be made inthe House of Commons by the Prime Minister as soon as Parliament,reassembles. We understand that the Prime Minister has indicated to Mr. Wilson Harris, M.P., that he will give him an opportunityof putting down a Question on the matter and we attach (at Annex II)a suggested Question and Answer.A. G.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1,12th March, 1947.ANNEX I paragraph 434 of the Curtis report we do not accept the view urged by some of our witnesses that a single department should be responsible for every aspect of the life of the deprivedchild. The principle of defining the functions of Government Departments bythe groups of people they look after rather than by the nature of the work theydo seems to us wrong; in this case we think it would also be administrativelyclumsy. We feel, too, that to consign these children for all purposes to the care of a single Ministry would be to emphasise what we wish to minimise the extent to avhich they are marked off from other children. We think that theyshould come within the purview of the Ministry of Education for education inthe same way as children living with their parents, and that they should besubject to the health supervision of the Ministry of Health in the same way asthe normal child is subject to it, and that, if physically or mentally handicapped,they should be treated as other children under these handicaps are treated by the responsible department e.g., the Ministry of Education or the Board of Control.If they are delinquent in the sense of requiring penal treatment, the department responsible for such treatment (the Home Office) must prescribe the treatment for them. The missing element in the lives of these children is the home back-ground, and we consider that all the children in whose lives that has ceased to exist or ceased to count should be brought under the supervision of a single
department. Which department is a question which must be settled on anotherlevel, and it does not seem to us to be so important as the achievement of unification-tion. The duty no doubt impinges on the functions on the one side of theMinistry of Health as the department responsible for the bodily welfare of chil-dren, and on the other side of the Ministry of Education which is the department responsible for children&apos;s mental training and to an increasing extent fordomiciliary provision for those pupils needing it; whereas the Home Office hasalready developed to a considerable extent the study of the substitute home. Wewould only urge that, whichever department undertakes the work, it shouldhave a Children&apos;s Branch making a special study of child welfare on the sideof the home, without specialist bias on any side, and an inspectorate able to judge whether the conditions for the child&apos;s total welfare as a human beingexist in a particular case. The responsible Minister might be well advised toappoint an Advisory Council to keep him in touch with developments in outsideexpert opinion on the subject of child care.ANNEX IIMr. Wilson Harris: To ask the Prime Minister whether a decision has yetbeen reached on the administrative arrangements for caring for children deprived of a normal home life.Proposed Reply: The Government accept . the recommendations of theCurtis and Clyde Committees that the task of providing a home background for children deprived of a normal home life should be brought under the supervision of a single central Department. They have decided that, for England andWales, this central jurisdiction should be concentrated in the Home Office. Inview of its special experience in this held and the general part which it playsin the protection and welfare of young people the Home Office is the central department best fitted to assume this responsibility. A new and enlargedChildren&apos;s Branch will be created in the Home Office with an expandedinspectorate organised on a regional basis. This Branch will devote itselfprimarily to the domiciliary welfare of homeless children in general and, thoughit will also deal with delinquent children for whom it is necessary to providesubstitute homes, it will be concerned only incidentally with delinquency. a standing Advisory Committee widely representative of the many interests involved and including representatives of the Ministry of Education, theMinistry of Health and the Ministry of Labour will be appointed to assist theHome Office in its administration. [In Scotland, my St. Hon. Friend is already the responsible Minister for all aspects of child care : but he proposes to assignto the Scottish Home Department functions broadly similar to those which willbe given to the Children&apos;s Branch of the Home Office and to appoint a ScottishStanding Advisory Committee.]The Government also accept the recommendations of the Curtis and ClydeCommittees that county councils and county borough councils in England andWales and county councils and town councils of large burghs in Scotland shouldbe the local authorities responsible for the welfare of all children deprived of a normal life. The arrangements for the discharge of this function in each area should be defined in a scheme drawn up by the local authority and approvedby the Secretary of State and it is proposed that, unless there are exceptionalreasons to the contrary, the local authority should, at least for a period of threeyears, exercise their responsibility through a children&apos;s committee on the lines suggested in the Curtis and. Clyde Reports. It is also intended that the schemes should make provision for the appointment by each local authority of a children&apos;sofficer who would be in general charge of the work of providing a home back-ground for homeless children.In so far as any transfer of statutory functions to the Home Secretaryappears to be desirable, the necessary steps will be taken under the Ministers ofthe Crown (Transfer of Powers) Act, and the Home Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Scotland will then take up the tasks of preparing the necessary legislation to implement those recommendations of the Curtis and ClydeCommittees which require changes in the law and of carrying out such pre-liminary work towards the reorganisation of the arrangements for caring fordeprived children as can be undertaken before the passage of legislation.
