annex report ON THE FIRST GENERAL CONFERENCE OF UNESCOHELD IN PARIS BETWEEN 19th NOVEMBER AND10th DECEMBER, 19561. Creation and Membership of UNESCOTwenty Member States of the Preparatory Commission of UNESCOhaving deposited instruments at the Foreign Office accepting the Constitu-tion, UNESCO was able to exist as a fully legal specialised agency of theUnited Nations in time for the opening of its first Conference in Paris on19th November. Subsequent acceptances brought the total number of voting-countries to thirty. Fourteen other members of the United Nations, not having deposited an Instrument accepting the Constitution at the ForeignOffice, were not entitled to vote, although they had signed the Constitutionof UNESCO. Most of them were represented by observers. The followingcountries who signed the Constitution of UNESCO were in this category:  Argentine Republic. Iraq.Chile. Liberia.Colombia. Luxembourg.Costa Rica. Nicaragua.Cuba. Panama.Guatemala. &quot;                         Uruguay.Iran. Yugoslavia.Non-members of UNESCO present as observers included representatives of sweden and Switzerland.2. The British Delegation to UNESCOThe United Kingdom was represented at the Conference by Mr. D. R. Hardman, M.P., Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofEducation;Sir Philip Morris, Vice-Chancellor of Bristol University;Sir Ernest Poolev, Chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain;Mr. J. B. Priestley;Sir Robert Robinson, President of the Royal Society.Alternate delegates were Sir John Maud, Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Education,who led the Delegation in the absence of Mr. Hardman;Sir Ronald Adam, Chairman of the British Council;Professor P. M. S. Blackett;Mr. Ronald Gould, of the National Union of Teachers;Dr. Margaret Read.The Delegation had the assistance at various times of some thirty experts and advisers.3. Plan of Work of the ConferenceAfter preliminary statements on general principles in plenary sessions,the Conference divided into three main Commissions:  (i) A Programme Commission, with sub-Commissions on Education;Mass Communication; Libraries and Museums; Natural Sciences;Social Sciences; Philosophy and Humanistic Studies; CreativeArts;(ii) an Administrative, Financial, Legal and External Relations Corn-mission; and(iii) a Commission on Rehabilitation and Reconstruction.i. The Programme commission the work of the sub-Commissions of the Programme Commission wasaccomplished on the whole smoothly and without serious controversy.The work of the Administrative, Financial, Legal and External relations commission proved considerably more troublesome, largely owing to the mass of intricate matter which had to be worked out carefully and in detail.The debates upon staff regulations, financial and budgetary matters werearduous and prolonged.   The British Delegation were strengthened by a
representative of the Treasury who took part in the discussions of Establish-ment and Staffing questions. The recommendations in the report of theProgramme Commission, co-ordinating all the work of its various sub-Commissions, were approved without discussion by the Conference.The detailed recommendations in the whole field of knowledge whichUNESCO will attempt to develop cannot be summarised in a few sentences.Yet to saj&apos; that they aimed at the increase, dissemination and preservation of knowledge can naturally give no view of their detailed content..Unfortunately for UNESCO, it is inherent in the nature of its work that it.can offer no spectacular projects for immediate human betterment likelyto catch the public imagination as the Pood and Agricultural organisation or the World Health Organisation should be able to provide. One projectenthusiastically supported may prove an exception. The duty of UNESCOto attack illiteracy throughout the world received universal approval. Forthe war-stricken countries, the proposal that UNESCO should do its utmost to assist the reconstruction and rehabilitation of shattered institutions oflearning was also a project with a high priority and universal assent. Anumber of useful projects for the improvement of library and museumresources and services; a series of studies in fundamental education and inthe adaptation of educational systems to promote international under-standing; developments in the fields of home and community planning,population problems, nationalism and internationalism, the impact of technological-logical developments on modern society; emphasis upon the contributionmade to social life by the rule of law; a co-ordination of modern scientificability grappling with the extension of knowledge and improving the con-ditions of life in backward areas, notably the Hylean Amazon Scheme, wereamong some of the major projects approved by the Programme Commission.The British Delegation contributed in all these fields and notably alsoin the sub-Commission on the Media of Mass Communication. Unlike theUnited States Delegation, which came fully briefed by several expertcommittees upon this part of unescos programme, the British delgation had largely to devise its own line during the Conference itself. The Britishteam, led by Mr. J. B. Priestley and assisted by Mr. Ritchie Calder andMr. John Grierson, worked hard to produce a practical and workmanlikeprogramme. The reward of their labours was that the Conference acceptedBritish leadership in this field and adopted the British scheme in its entirety,with the willing assent of the United States and other Delegations. The.British proposals included An investigation of deficiencies in press, film and radio facilities in countries affected by the war.Publicity projects approved by UNESCO.A  technical  training scheme to  improve   standards  of  technical personnel.These projects were calculated to assist the maintenance, of native culturesagainst the export of more technically efficient lands.A world university of the air, an international forum and an internationalideas bureau were among the other projects suggested for development byUNESCO at small cost, but with promise of useful results.The need for co-ordinating this work with that proposed by the united nations was emphasised by the British Delegation in the field of MassCommunication as in other relevant spheres of unescos work.5. Administrative, Financial, Legal and External Relations commission the report of the Administrative Commission occasioned more contro-versy, partly on account of the divergence of opinion on the degree to whichthe Director-General and the Secretariat should be subject to comprehensiveregulations governing every detail of their activities (a concept which wasresisted by the British Delegation), but, above all, over a figure at which thebudget should be assessed.The budget proposed by the Preparatory Commission for the year 1947amounted to just over 7-1 million dollars, to which was added a supplementarybudget amounting to nearly half a million dollars for rehabilitation and relief.Another million dollars has to be added for the expenditure of the PreparatoryCommission itself, making a total of approximately 9 million dollars. TheBritish Delegation recommended the accejjtanee of a budget of 7^ million dollars for all approved activities in 1947, including rehabilitation and relief.The delegates from Australia and South Africa proposed a figure of just over -J million dollars for 1947, which was narrowly defeated in the budgetcommission in favour of a compromise figure of 6 million dollars proposedby the Czechoslovakia]! delegate, which secured acceptance by a majorityof one vote. The United Kingdom Delegation in a plenary session maintained that the budget figure of 7J million dollars for 1947 should be accepted.Not one of the sub-Commissions of the Programme Commission had con-sidered that the budget allocated for its own field was excessive; on thecontrary, a number declared that it would be impossible to achieve the[33340] b 2
programme they had approved with their . budgeted funds. Furthermore,;there was the overriding consideration; that confidence and public interest-hi UNESCO had still to be created within the territory of every Member,State, and the British Delegation considered that a poor start would bemade in this essential task if responsible Delegations at the outset of UNESCO&apos;s career demonstrated their own lack of faith in its programme which a reduction in the sums voted for its fulfilment would imply. TheUnited States Delegation refrained from intervening in the discussions in.the Administrative Commission, but endeavoured to exercise strong pressurebehind the scenes to secure a reduction, for which it also voted. The attitudeof the Delegation was in sharp contrast with the professions of faith in;UXESCO made so enthusiastically by Members of the Delegation at. theConference and also within the United States before they came to the.Conference. The United States - Delegation&apos; s attitude was irreconcilable with,the frequent assertions made during the course of the debates of- thePreparatory Commission that in the United States the educational, scientificend culturally interested public were deeply concerned in making a successof UNESCO. The final vote in plenary sessions on the budget figure on10th December approved by 20 votes to 8 a total budget of $6,050,000)(including expenditure incurred or to be incurred in 1946). It was decided,to establish a revolving fund to which Member States would contribute,deposits to a total of 8 million dollars. The contributions to the budget andto the revolving fund will be assessed on the United Nations scale, adjusted to UNESCO membership.The Legal and External Relations sub-Commission was another sectionof the Conference to which the British Delegation contributed effectively..The Conference accepted en bloc the recommendations of this sub-.Commission, which included a draft agreement between UNESCO and theUnited Nations. A proposed draft convention on privileges and immunitiesfor UNESCO officials and delegates was deferred on a motion by the UnitedStates Delegation&apos;pending the conclusion of a general convention applicableto all United Nations Specialised Agencies; texts of draft agreements,amended by the sub-Commission, were approved governing the relationships between UNESCO and the Institute of Intellectual Co-operation; UNESCOand the International Bureau of Education; UNESCO and the InternationalCouncil of Scientific Unions; UNESCO and other Specialised Agencies. &apos; a provisional directive to the&apos; Director-General of UNESCO governing his negotiations with uon-governmental and international organisations was alsoapproved by the Conference.6. The Executive Board -The UNESCO Constitution provides for the establishment of an executive board, composed of IS members of the Conference, which is responsiblefor the execution of the programme.&apos; The1 members of the Executive board are nominally elected as persons and not as&apos; representatives of national interests. There was, however, a good deal of jockeying for places on theBoard among certain of the delegations. The general effect of the decisions taken by the Conference was to throw upon the Board a considerable amountof responsibility for&apos; the administrative and financial arrangements of the secretariat.The following shows the composition : of the - Board elected on24th November:  Dr. Walker (Australia).M. Verniers (Belgium).M. Carneiro (Brazil)..II. E. Hon. Dr. Dore (Canada).Mr. Chen Yuan (China).Dr. Opocensky (Czechoslovakia).Shafik Ghorbal Bey (Egypt).M. Auger (France).M. Photiades (Greece).Sir S. Badhakrishnan (India).Dr. Martinez-Baez (Mexico). .M. Kruyt (Netherlands).M. Sommerfelt (Norway).Dr. Falski (Poland).M. Guntekin (Turkey).Sir John Maud (United Kingdom).Hon. A. MacLeish (U.S.A.).Dr.. Parra-Perez (Venezuela).The drawing of lots- decided which members of the Executive board would remain in office for one year, two years or three years.In office for one year: Professor Kruyt, Dr.. Martinez-Baez, Sir JohnMaud, Mr. Chen Yuan, Dr. Walker, Dr. Falski.
In office for two years: Gliorbal Bey, M. Dore, M. Opeoensky, Sir S.Badhakrishnan, M. Verniers, Professor Photiades.In office for three years: Professor Paulo Carneiro, M. Pierre Auger,Professor Sommerfett, M. Guntekin, Mr. Archibald MaoLeish, Dr. Parra-Perez.7. The Director-GeneralNo problem before the Executive Board occasioned more anxiety anddemanded such long and persistent negotiation as the selection of theDirector-General. The position of the British. Delegation was that Dr. JulianHuxley was the best candidate known to the United Kingdom Delegation,who would accordingly vote for him. Originally his sole opponent was mr. Francis Biddle, former United States Attorney-General. Mr. Biddlehad the support of Mr. President Truman, and the United States Delegation,although secretly divided among themselves on this issue, as on many others,jjressed his claims until they were seen to be certain to fail. Many nameswere then canvassed, the majority not demanding serious consideration.-Eventually, after the most wearing discussions, the Executive Board decidedto nominate Dr. Huxley, who was known to be unwilling to serve for morethan two years instead of the six years allowed under UNESCO&apos;s Consti-tution. In full conference, the Executive Board&apos;s decision was upheld by22 votes in favour of Dr. Huxley, 3 against, two of the (Secret) ballot papers being spoiled. The United States Delegate made public the factthat he had voted for Dr. Huxley. The Executive Board was then left withthe need to approve the administrative arrangements of the Secretariat andto select a Deputy Director-General. Dr. Walter Laves, of the United States,was later appointed to this post.8. Future arrangements the Executive Board succeeded in securing agreement to the creationof a Standing Committee of 10 members, with defined powers to carry onunder agreed rules of procedure to deal with UNESCO business in theintervals between the necessarily infrequent meetings of the full executive board.The seat of the general Conference in 1947 will be Mexico City and the choice for 1948 will probably be Oslo.9. Conference Arrangements generally the French Government left no doubt about the welcome it was ready,to give to UNESCO and, in the series of receptions and other social events,the cordiality of French hospitality was fully manifest.The pressure of Conference business made it inrpossible for the majorityof the delegates, including the British Delegation, to attend more than very few of the exhibitions, lectures and other events organised by UNESCO andthe French Government as part of a UNESCO month of celebrations. Thefuture celebrations during UNESCO month will be upon a reduced and more economical scale.The British Delegation was admirably served by the Conference Depart-ment of the Foreign Office.10. ConclusionUNESCO was fortunate in being able to conduct its first Conference inan atmosphere almost immune from political controversy. The Bussianswere absent and the Yugoslavs were present merely as observers, a rolewhich did not prevent one of their Delegation creating a minor sensationby proffering an interpretation of UNESCO&apos;s duty as seen from theCommunist point of view. More interesting was the emotion and applausearoused at the end of the Conference by the appearance of representativesof liepublican Spain, who may, however, have achieved their effect as muchby the inclusion of Picasso in their number as by the sympathy felt fortheir cause on purely political grounds.The relations of the British Delegation with their colleagues from otherlands were uniformly happy, particularly with the Dominion and Indiandelegates. The leader of the New Zealand Delegation, Dr. Beeby, provedone of the discoveries of the Conference for his ability as Chairman ofCommissions and sub-Commissions.Such notes of discord as arose came almost entirely from the UnitedStates Delegation, principally owing to their own internal lack of harmony.For political reasons at home they were committed to two unpopular tasks.They had to oppose Dr. Huxley and to support Judge Biddle for Director-General, and they had to secure a reduction in the budget of UNESCO.Their success in &quot;the latter task was more damaging than their failure to convince the Executive Board about the merits of Mr. Biddle.  The spectacle
of the owners of the gold vaults of Fort Leavenworth striving to diminish the resources of an Organisation set up to sustain a cause proclaimed bytheir orators to be one upon which the future peace of the world would depend, carried its own message to the world and, it is to be hoped, inparticular to the educated public within the TJ.S.A. who have alreadybeen stirred to something approaching a crusading zeal on behalf of UNESCO&apos;s aims and purposes.Mr. Benton, Assistant Secretary of State, unpopular within his ownDelegation and the principal cause, no doubt, of its lack of inner cohesionand team spirit, won little respect at the Conference. He made the unfortunate Mr. MacLeish the mouthpiece of much of his unwelcomedoctrine, thus effectively robbing Mr. MacLeish of the semi-apostolic positionhe had been able to achieve during the constituent conference of UNESCOin London in 1945, which had nothing more definite to do than to sketch inoutline the brave new world which UNESCO was to plan.Apart from the immediate attack upon reconstruction and illiteracy,UNESCO will undertake no great major projects during 1947, which will therefore be a year devoted in the main to consolidation, to the establishmentof effective working relationships internally and externally, and to the further study and planning of a number of highly desirable projects which shouldyield substantial dividends in the years to come.At home it will now be the task of the Ministry of Education, in liaison with other Departments and agencies of His Majesty&apos;s Government, andparticularly through the means of its National- Co-operating Bodies, to do its best to implement the programme and policies agreed upon in Paris.Outstanding among the approved projects are:  (i) Aid for educational reconstruction in devastated countries (includingBurma) by the collection of voluntary contributions in cash andkind.(ii) Increased production of books, scientific equipment and educationalsupplies in general.(iii) Provision   of   Fellowships   and   resources   for  training   technical personnel.(iv) Aid in an international attack on illiteracy.
