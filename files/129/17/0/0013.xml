CIRCULATED   ^JI3HIS. DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1947SECRET Copy  No.CP. (47) 630h February. 1947CABINETPOLITICAL  BROADCASTSNote by the Prime minister in paragraph 3 of CP. (47) 7 &quot;Ministerial Broadcasts&quot; I undertook to circulate a memorandum on the agreement reached with the Opposition andthe B.B.C. about political broadcasts.   An aide-memoire setting out the termsf this agreement is annexed for the information and guidance of Ministers.-2. I should perhaps add in expansion of the reference to Budget broadcastsin paragraph 6 (i) of the aide-memoire that, in view of representations fromthe Governors of the B.B.C., it has been agreed that, in the ordinary course,there should be no second Ministerial broadcast on the Budget. This naturallywill not prejudice the right of the Government to arrange for a reply to theOpposition broadcast on the Budget, if it so wishes, by drawing upon its annualquota of political broadcasts.3. I mentioned in paragraph 5 of CP. (47) 7 that, in the expectation thatthe number of Ministerial broadcasts will be substantially reduced, it was proposedto approach the B.B.C. to give special consideration to any requests for a fulltreatment of announcements which, but for the arrangements referred to inparagraph 4 of CP. (47) 7, would have been considered of sufficient importanceto justify a Ministerial broadcast. I am glad to inform my colleagues that theB.B.C. have now given an assurance on this point.C R. A.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,mh February, 1947.
ANNEXAide-memoire1. It is desirable that political broadcasts of a controversial character shallbe resumed.2. In view of their responsibilities for the care of the nation the Govern-ment should be able to use the wireless from time to time for Ministerialbroadcasts which, for example, are purely factual, or explanatory of legislation or administrative policies approved by Parliament; or in the nature of appeals tothe nation to co-operate in national policies, such, as fuel economy or recruitingwhich require the active participation of the public. Broadcasts on Stateoccasions also come in the same category.It will be incumbent on Ministers making such broadcasts to be as impartialas possible, and in the ordinary way there will be no question of a reply by theOpposition. Where, however, the Opposition think that a Government broadcastis controversial it will be open to them to take the.matter up through the usual channels with a view to a reply.(i) As a reply if one is to be made should normally be within a very short period after the original broadcast, say three days, the B.B.C. willbe free to exercise its own judgment if no agreement is arrived atwithin that period,(ii) Replies under this paragraph will not be included in the number ofbroadcasts provided for under paragraph 4.(iii) Copies of the scripts of broadcasts under this paragraph shall besupplied to the leaders of each Party.(iv) All requests for Ministerial broadcasts under this paragraph shall becanalised through the Minister designated for this purpose atpresent the Postmaster-General.3. &quot;&apos; Outside&quot; broadcasts, e.g., of speeches at Party Conferences, which arein the nature of news items, shall carry no right of reply by the other side.4. A limited number of controversial party political broadcasts shall be allocated to the various parties in accordance with their polls at the last GeneralElection. The allocation shall be calculated on a yearly basis and the total numberof such broadcasts shall be a matter for discussion between the parties andthe B.B.C.5. The Opposition parties shall have the right, subject to discussion through,the usual channels, to choose the subjects for their own broadcasts. Either sidewill be free, if it wishes, to use one of its quota for the purpose of replying to a previous broadcast, but it will be under no necessity to do so. There will, ofcourse, fie no obligation on a party to use its whole quota.
8. (i) Paragraphs 4 and 5 relate to controversial party political broadcastson issues of major policy on behalf of the leading political Parties. For the ensuing year the total number, excluding Budget broadcasts, shall be 12- &apos;divided as to Government 6, Conservative Opposition 5, Liberal Opposition 1.Reasonable notice will be given to the B.B.C.(ii) The B.B.C. reserve the right, after consultation with the party leaders,to invite to the microphone a member of either House of outstanding nationaleminence who may have become detached from any party.(iii) Apart from these limited broadcasts on major policy the B.B.C. are free to invite members of either House to take part in controversial broadcasts of around-table character in which political questions are dealt with, provided twoor more persons representing different sides take part in the broadcasts.(iv) No broadcasts arranged by the B.B.C. other than the normal reportingof Parliamentary proceedings are to take place on any question while it is thesubject of legislation in either House.7. Where any dispute arises an effort shall be made to settle it through theusual channels. Where this is not possible the B.B.C. will have to decide the(matter on its own responsibility.8. These arrangements shall be reviewed after a year, or earlier if any party to the conference so desires.
