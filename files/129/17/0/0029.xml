DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJBSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1947CP. (47) 7912th March, 1947CABINETPREPARATION OF LEGISLATION FOR THE 1947-48 session memorandum by the Lord Privy seal in accordance with the procedure approved by the Prime Minister last year,the Committee on Future Legislation have considered, in consultation with theMinisters concerned and with Parliamentary Counsel, what preparatory workon legislation for the 1947-48 Session should now be put in hand, withoutprejudice to the decisions which the Cabinet will have to take later in the year on the final content of The King&apos;s Speech.2. We have assumed that the current Session will be concluded at the endof July or the beginning of August and that the 1947-48 Session will begin inOctober; and, since experience last autumn showed the need to have a numberof medium-sized Bills ready at the beginning of the Session, we have includedsuch Bills, as well as major Bills, in our review. We have not. however, attempted to draw up a provisional programme of minor Bills.3. We feel that the 1947-48 Legislative Programme should be as light aspossible, in order to give some relief to Parliament itself, to leave Ministers and officials more time for administration and to preserve a reasonable balance betweenthe 1947-48 Session and the fourth and fifth Sessions of the present Parliament.We haA^e therefore excluded from our proposals all Bills which, so far as we can judge, could reasonably be postponed until a later Session. What remains, how-ever, is still a formidable programme and it should be borne in mind that, thoughthe 1947-48 Session will be longer than the current Session, the Committee stage of several of the Bills proposed for it (e.g., the Government of India Bill) willhave to be taken on the Floor of the House. Moreover, a certain amount of essential legislation, the need for which cannot at present be foreseen, is boundto emerge during the lest of the year. It ma)&apos;, therefore, in the event prove impossible to include in the 1947-48 Programme all the Bills which we haveprovisionally accepted, and for this reason we have arranged the Bills in eachof the lists in paragraph 5 below in the order of priority in which we recommendthat Parliamentary Counsel should undertake the work of drafting.4. We received from the Ministers concerned proposals for an Iron andSteel Industry Nationalisation Bill and for a Gas Industry Nationalisation Bill.The Minister of Supply pointed out that the Iron and Steel Industry Nationalisa-tion Bill would be highly con trover sial and that, unless it could be introducedearly in the 1947-48 Session, it was doubtful whether it could be passed in the lifetime of the present Parliament. On the other hand, the Minister of Fuel and power urged that the Gas Industry Nationalisation Bill should be included inthe 1947-48 Programme on the ground that it would be wrong to prolong the interval between the nationalisation of electricity and of gas. We are satisfiedthat it would be a mistake to attempt to pass both Bills in the 1947-48 Session[33306] b
and we feel that the choice between these Bills must be made by the Cabinet, whowill no doubt wish to examine the policy questions connected with the proposedBills before reaching a final decision.5.   Subject to what is said in paragraph 4, our conclusions are : -(a) The aim should be to have the following Bills ready for introductionby October :-(i) Major Bills-Criminal Justice.Agriculture (Scotland).Poor Law.Bating and Valuation.Restrictive Practices.Block Grant.Block Grant (Scotland).Legal Aid.Lunacy and Mental Deficiency (Scotland).(ii) Medium-sized Bills Alternative Remedies.Training and Employment.Motorways.River Boards.Industrial Life Assurance.East African Ground Nuts.(b) The aim should be to have the following Bills ready for introductionbefore or soon after Christmas : (i) Major Bills Electoral Reform.Government of India.Government of Burma.Children.Sea Fish Industry(ii) Medium-sized Bills Superannuation-Redistribution.Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Old Cases).British Nationality and Nationality of Married Women.Cinematograph Films.Veterinary Surgeons.Legal Aid (Scotland).Rats and Mice.Coast Protection.Wireless Telegraphy.Nurses.(c) The following programme of Consolidation Bills should be undertaken in the 1947-48 Session, provided that this can be done without inter-ference with the preparation of new legislation : Agricultural Holdings Acts.Agricultural Wages Acts.Companies Acts.Marriage (Scotland) Acts.Agricultural Wages (Scotland) Acts.Notes on the Bills mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) are given in the annex to this memorandum.6.   We invite the Cabinet to agree (1) that, pending the formulation of a final Legislative Programme for the1947-48 Session, Parliamentary Counsel should proceed with thepreparation of the Bills listed in paragraph 5, in so far as this canbe done without prejudice to the demands of the current Session slegislation;
that the work of drafting the Bills in each group should be undertaken in the order in which the Bills are listed;that the 1947-48 Legislative Programme should include only one majornationalisation Bill and that a decision between the Iron and SteelIndustry Nationalisation Bill and the Gas Industry NationalisationBill should be deferred until the Cabinet have considered the questionsof policy connected with these Bills;that the Legislation Committee should carry&apos; out a monthly review ofthe progress made in preparing legislation for the 1947-48 session and should be authorised to make such minor adjustments in theprogramme of work as seem necessary in the light of developments.7. As is made clear in paragraph 1, the proposals in this memorandumrepresent only a provisional plan pending the formulation of a final programme for the 1947-48 Session concurrently with the preparation of The King&apos;s speech and it is most important that the inclusion of a Bill in the lists given in para-graph 5 should not be regarded as authorising the Minister concerned to anticipate The King&apos;s Speech by promising that the Bill will be introduced next session.A.
