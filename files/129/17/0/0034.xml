(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (47) 84t&quot;?th March,  1947CABINETTRANSPORT BILLLIMITATIONS ON &quot;C&quot;  LICENCESMemorandum by the Minister of TransportNo feature of the Transport Bill raises so muchopposition as the proposal to limit &quot;C4 licence holders toa reeius of 40 miles from their base, unless they obtain a permit from the Licensing Authority to operate beyond thatlimit,The case against the proposal rests partly on theimportance to  industry of being able to treat  its fleet of motor vehicles as part of the equipment of the factory or works and      of having at beck and call for any kind ofemergency purpose the means of moving any given consignmentrapidly without the necessity of going to other people.The latter argument has been very strongly stressed to me bytrading interests,  and    industrialists  ih particular do not accept the reply that a public transport concern will have such an efficient organisation as  to be able to give the kindof service required.      They argue further that there is no real risk of abuse and that no question of sabotaging thepublic concern arises,  since industrialists will only maintain their vehicles if they are satisfied that it is necessary and economical for them to do so in order to keep down the costof production.      It is believed that in some cases, privatetransport costs are not fully loaded with the proper proportionof overheads, but it will be difficult to secure acceptanceof the argument that industrialists as a class do notascertain the true costs of their transport operations.Moreover,  their case is based more on convenience than on cost.Industrialists and traders generally,  as represented by theirassociations which I received in deputation a few days ago,are taking root and branch opposition to this part of the Bill.Another powerful line of opposition is the general,or political,  one, resting on the objection,  in principle,to interference with the liberty of the trader to carry hisown goods in his own vehicles,  and also on the argument, whichmust be accepted as a strong one,  that the best and simplestprotection against any oppressive monopoly is to be foundin this freedom.The combination of these various oppositions makea formidable case against the proposals, which will no doubt be voiced at all stages of the Bill in both Houses.COPY NO.
- The case for the proposal is that unless a largeshare of the private traffic  is consigned through the publichaulage system,  its overhead charges will he over-burdened&apos;and the cost will fall upon the small &quot;traders who cannotmaintain a private transport system.      Their costs in tur-n.will be increased by virtue of the fact that the largerbusinesses get an undue advantage by being able to handlethemselves selectively what it may pay them individuallybest to handle privately and of being able to throw uponthe     public haulage ss^stem (including rail as well as road services) the less remunerative traffic, for conveyance ofwhich they will pay only the normal rates.      To put thepoint in another way,  the position would not be unlike thatwhich has existed between road and rail when the railwayshave suffered the ercsion of so much of the higher class and better paying traffic.      My advisers who have direct knowledgeof road haulage are much impressed by this danger.So far as the drafting of Clause 57 is concerned,I. doubt whether it can be much improved without destroying the value of the provisions,  and any further substantial concessions might indeed merely result in the establishmentof a permit system involving a large number of operators in which trouble and a new piece of licensing machinery withoutany effective direction or conservation of traffic to thepublic system.Nor would an increase in the radius of unrestrictedoperation from forty miles to fifty miles have much effector give much satisfaction, while any greater extension ofthe radius would go far to destroy the value of the Clause.An alternative, which industrial interests mightbe disposed to consider,  would put the whole onus on theBritish Transport Commission to object to the grant of a&quot;Cl! licence to particular operators beyond a radius of forty(or fifty) miles.      The licensing authority would  then bereqpired to grant a licence free of restrictions unless theCommission satisfied the licensing authority that theapplicant was likely to use his vehicles  in a manner whichwould unduly interfere with the ability of the Commission toprovide an adequate,  economical and. properly integratedsystem of inland transport or was requiring the Commissionto supply him with public transport in circumstances orto an extent which did not give the Commission a reasonableshare cf the applicant&apos;s total traffic.      To place any suchonus on the Commission would,  I think, make the Clauselargely inoperative and its effective administration very  -difficult.Yet another suggestion, is to suspend the operationof the restrictive clauses for two or three years,  duringwhich interval experience would be gained as to the extent ofthe ability of the Commission to provide the necessary servicesitself and of the need for safeguards against erosion of thehigher grade traffic.      This would -probably expose the schemeto constant attack and the Minister to the continued pressure to repeal the set ticns or never to appoint a day for their operation.
The choices are:(1) To modify the clause on the lines of the draft annexed;(2) To place upon the British Transport commission the whole onus of objections  such objectionto be made on application for any renewal of a&quot;C&quot; licence made after a specified date and tobe based on evidence as to the past operations of the licence holder;(3) To drop the proposals altogether.A decision has become urgent because it will be unwito fight through Committee proposals which we may wish or be forced to modify during the remaining stages of the Bill-A. B (Ministry of Transport,12th March,  19U7.
