KIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1947SECRET Copy No.CP. (47) SI5th February, 1947.CABINETTHE SIGNATURE ON SUBORDINATE legislation memorandum by the Prime minister as the policy embodied in recent legislation is carried into administra-tive effect, the flow of subordinate instruments will inevitably increase, and public attention will be directed to our use of the powers delegated to us by Parliament.In these circumstances we must expect criticism not only of the content of oursubordinate legislation, but also of our procedure, and one of the arguments thatwill probably be advanced is that we have fostered the growth of bureaucracyby allowing matters which were formerly dealt with by Parliament in statutesto be decided by individual Ministers, and in practice by officials. While I am satisfied that my colleagues do, in fact, exercise personally the powers entrusted to them, and that if criticisms of this sort were made we should have an effectivereply, nevertheless, I am clear that this type of argument cannot be expectedto cease altogether so long as the majority of our subordinate instruments carryno signature but that of an official.2. I am, of course, aware that the signature is appended to these instru-ments for the purpose of authentication only, and that the Rule or Order musthave been made by the Minister before the instrument can be authenticated bythe official. I doubt, however, whether this point is appreciated by more than avery few members of Parliament and I am sure that it is not at all understood by the public at large. The fact remains that the present practice lends colourto the belief that subordinate legislation can be made without the personal know-ledge of the responsible Minister.
3. For these reasons, although I am not suggesting that officials cannotlegally sign these instruments. I believe that it would be expedient that ministers should normally sign instruments of a legislative character or at any rate themost important ones. I appreciate that in order to secure uniformity of practice it is desirable to define the class of orders which should normally be signed by ministers in some way which will provide an easily distinguishable line of demarcation. I thei&quot;efore suggest, that the new practice should extend to allStatutory Rules and Orders, other than Orders in Council, which fall within theterms of reference of the Select Committee on Statutory Rules and Orders, thatis to say, every Statutory Rule or Order laid or laid in draft before Parliament, ^being a Rule, Order or draft upon which proceedings may be, or might havebeen, taken in either House in pursuance of any Act of Parliament. Depart-ments have already to distinguish this class of instrument for the purposes ofthe Select Committee, and this definition will cover most of the important instru-ments as well as those which Parliament is most likely to question. There will no doubt be exceptional cases when a Minister is unable to sign by reason ofillness, absence or other good cause; and there may also be cases where the precisemanner of authentication is laid down by statute : the normal rule, however,should be as I have suggested.4. I recognise that this will lay an additional burden on some of mycolleagues, particularly those who make a large number of subordinate instru-ments; it is, however, a duty which is already discharged, without undue difficulty,by some of the Secretaries of State, and I feel sure that arrangements can be made so that it will take comparatively little time. I am confident, moreover, thatany time thus spent will be more than counter-balanced by the saving of timeand energy which might otherwise have to be devoted to dealing with themisapprehensions to which I have referred; and I ask all my colleagues to makethe necessary arrangements accordingly.C. R. A.10 downing  Street, S.W. 1,5th February, 1947.
