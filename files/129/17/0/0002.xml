TSTATEMENT RELATING TO defence i.   INTRODUCTIONi. The Statement relating to Defence (Cmd. 6743) presented to parliament in February, 1946, resumed the practice of presenting to Parliament a generalsurvey of the policy relating to defence which His Majesty&apos;s government intended, to pursue, and of the provision in manpower, material and finance,which it was proposed to make, in the ensuing financial year. That white paper referred more particularly to the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government,building upon the great development of centralised organisation and controlof military affairs which had-. taken place during the- war years,&quot; to consolidate and extend- this development, so that the broad policygoverning the size and composition of our defence forces, the progress of research and development, and the production of military equipment and stores, can be formulated and presented to Parliament as a co-ordinatedwhole &quot;.3. The central feature of the new organisation in the White Paper (Cmd.6923) presented to Parliament in October, 1946, is the creation of a separatepost of Minister of Defence, with a small Ministry staffed in part by serving officers and in part by civilians, and incorporating Committees and PlanningStaffs which the needs of defence have brought into being in the past 30 years.3. The Annual Estimates will continue to afford Parliament the opportunityfor scrutinising and discussing the several activities of each of the service departments. The intention of-the present Paper is to give a picture ofdefence policy and provision as a whole, and to afford the opportunity for parliament to consider and debate the problems of defence in a generalcontext. The machinery for the Central Defence Organisation of this countryis intended to assist this yearly review of defence policy and, to quote para. 27of Cmd. 6923,&apos;&apos; to present ... a coherent scheme of expenditure which will give thecountry forces and equipment in properly balanced proportions &quot;.4. The primary function of the new Minister and of his Ministry must bethe broad apportionment of available resources among the three FightingServices. This task is no less important, and is certainly no less difficult,after the termination of world-wide hostilities than in the years just beforethe outbreak of the recent war, when all the country&apos;s efforts in the defencefield were addressed to the urgent problem of rearmament and expansion.Further, at a time when defence activities, and the resources that can be allocated to them, are shrinking, it is the more important to ensure that firstthings come first, and that while the immediate problems and commitments of the Armed Forces are provided for, the longer view of defence needs andthe means of fulfilling them is given full weight.II.   THE PRESENT POSITION RELATING TO DEFENCE[ 5. A year ago the defence problem had two main aspects: first, there wereJAvu^q a number of major commitments, directly loft oveg-from the period of hostilities-ties, requiring the presence of British forces in various parts of the world;secondly, the rapid rundown of Forces personnel which the release schemejwould bring about in the course of 1946 made it necessary to have regard tos-wpa^ 3ne longer term problems of the tutufeZ,organisation of the Armed Forces. aa4^*AM**l^^the-!i^hod--ef^^55931 A 2
6. 1947 will still be governed by these two main factors, and must, there-fore, be regarded as yet another transitional year in the ordered developmentof defence policy. Apart from the rundown of 3,500,000 from the munitions industries the release scheme has, very smoothly, returned upwards of4,290,000 Service men and women to civil life. The process of release willcontinue in the coming year. It should be borne in mind, however, that therundown of the large war-time Forces means the loss to the Services of thegreat bulk of trained war intakes, whose place is taken by younger men ofshorter service! this-impos&quot;eT^nafge^rieasure of reorganlsaHorITupon theServices. Commitments remaining from the war period are more fully con-sidered in the following Section of this Paper. The progress made with the resettlement of the world, which for so long was disappointingly slow, nowfortunately shows real signs of improvement. But the reflection of thatimprovement, if it is maintained, in a reduction of the military responsibilities of this country can only be gradual.7. Meanwhile, developments in recent months have stressed the urgent need of restoring a balanced peace economy at the earliest moment, and by all practicable measures. Defence policy must -be compatible with this nationalneed not only because of the heavy demands made on national resources,both of manpower and material, by the Armed Forces, but also because a successful defence policy must find its roots in healthy social and economicconditions. It is both inevitable and right that the rehabilitation of the civileconomy should increasingly absorb the country&apos;s efforts and resources, tothe diminution of activities in the defence field. But it is essential that the fruits of seven years of intense war effort should not be thrown away by anill-considered jettisoning of defence responsibilities, however admirable maybe the aim of lightening the national burden. Two major wars in onegeneration have pointed the force of this conclusion, and. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are fully resolved to strike a considered balance between theneeds of the defence of this country and the urgent requirements of the post-war national economy as a whole.III.   DEFENCE COMMITMENTS IN THE COMING YEAR8. Owing to the essentially transitional nature of the year 1947-48, our defence commitments fall broadly under two heads, namely (a) Current.  -(b) Long Term.9. (a) Current. Our current commitments throughout the world, someof which are transitional in nature, are as follows: (i) Western Europe. Our forces in Germany have continued to discharge their duties connected with enforcing disarmament and demilitarisation and maintaining internal security in the British Zone. It has been possible toreduce to some extent our occupation forces. The necessity, however, forthe retention of our forces, both from the point of view of internal security and to support the policy of the Control Council in Berlin, remainsamdiminished.It is necessary to retain forces in Austria until a Peace Treaty has been ratified and agreement is reached for the withdrawal of Allied Forces.(ii) Middle East and the Mediterranean. When the Italian Peace Treatyhas been ratified by all the Powers concerned, it will be possible to with-draw our forces from Venezia Giulia with the exception of our contingent of the small international, force which in accordance with the draft treaty will remain in the Trieste Free Territory at the disposal of the Governor,until-the new regime is fully established.
10We have been able to reduce the size of our forces in Greece and theremainder will, it is hoped, stay for a limited period only.In Palestine the preservation of law and order and the control of illegal immigration requires the presence of substantial forces of all three Services.Forces of all three Services will be required in the Mediterranean and middle East to safeguard our communications. we must also continue toprovide small garrisons for British Colonies.(iii) The Indian Ocean. British forces are required to safeguard Britishinterests, in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, and some forces are alsoretained in India and Burma to assist in maintaining internal securitywhilst the new Constitutions of these countries are being formulated.(iv) Far East. We must maintain forces in the Far East to providegarrisons for British Colonies, including Hong Kong and Malayapand toassist in maintaining security.It is the intention of His lMa.jesty&apos;s Government to continue to play their part in the occupation of Japan, although some reduction in the size of ourcontingent is being made.Our tasks in the N.E.I. have been completed and all our forces withdrawn.(v) OtKer areas. Small British forces will be required to provide support for local forces in Africa and the West Indies.10. (6) Long Term. The object of U.N.O., the fulfilment of which depends upon the full co-operation of all its members, is to establish a stablesystem for the maintenance of peace. This will, it is hoped, ultimately allow of a regulation and reduction of national armaments, on which indeed dis-cussions have already been initiated. In the long run, therefore, the size ofour armed forces will be governed by the degree of disarmament actuallyachieved.In any event the meeting of the following long term commitments is funda-mental to our ability to fulfil our declared intention to support the object ofthe United Nations Organisation: (i) The Security of the United Kingdom.&apos; The United Kingdom remains the main base for specialised training and administration of all our forces,including those overseas. It is necessary, moreover, to maintain in theUnited Kingdom forces which, with the addition of those immediately available for mobilisation, will be the minimum sufficient to ensure thesecurity of the country and its communications. As the Charter of theUnited Nations itself lays down in Article 51 &quot; Nothing in the presentCharter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective defenceif an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, untilthe Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain inter-national &apos; peace and security. . . .&quot;(ii) The Safeguarding of Communications. The safeguarding of com-munications is vital to the defence of the United Kingdom, the Common-wealth and the Colonies and requires, therefore, the maintenance of forcesin various parts of the world.(iii) The Contribution to Forces of the United Nations Organisation.We must be prepared to provide forces for use under the Security council when called upon to do so, n^jju^.

The previous Section of this Paper has indicated the commitments invarious parts of the world which the Armed Forces have still to meet. a word here may be desirable as to the somewhat different roles of each of thethree fighting services, in relation to the tasks which fall&apos;to them to performin the coming months.
i2. The main burden of the immediate requirements for British Forces invarious parts of the world falls upon the Army. The result is that largenumbers of men are still required by the Army in excess of the probable size of a post-war army- But while the Army has to meet a primary responsibilityfor furnishing effective operational forces and detachments to meet world-widecommitments, it must at the same time take thought for the building up ofthe permanent regular army of the future. The problems of organisation which this imposes on the War Office and on the Army authorities are verygreat, and ordered progress towards a future regular force is rendered - moredifficult by the existence of these short-term commitments.13. With the Royal Navy and R.A.F., the problem is somewhat different.It follows from the fact that the occupational commitments of this country as (described above mainly affect the Army, that the Navy and R.A.F. can give greater prominence in their current defence plans to the problem of the prepara-tion and organisation of eventual post-war Forces of the necessary composition.Despite the demands made by current defence commitments all over the world,however, it may be anticipated that in the absence of any unlocked forworsening of the international position, each of the three Services will be increasingly concerned with planning the permanent post-war organisation,distribution and composition of its own forces.V.   MANPOWER14. To maintain the Armed Forces at the minimum numbers necessary toenable them effectively to fulfil the role and carry out the commitmentsdescribed in previous Sections of this Paper, a major demand must continueto be made on the manpower of the United Kingdom, both for their uniformedpersonnel and also for those engaged on the production of Service arms andequipment. The numbers of men and women estimated to be serving in theForces &quot;on the 31st March, 1948, amount to 1,087,000, as compared with thefigure of on 31st December, 1946.15. As regards manpower for-Service production, research and development,etc., His Majesty&apos;s Government a year ago set a ceiling of 500,000 to bereached by 31st December, 1946. . This figure was actually reached in October,1946, and by the end of December the numbers employed on production,etc., for the Services had fallen to ^s-?. o 00. It is calculated that to meetthe production and related requirements of the Services during the financialyear 1947-48 a labour force of approximately 450,000 will be required. some reduction may be possible even on this lower figure.16. This demand on the manpower resources of the country is admittedlyheavy. But it is rightly to be considered against the background of the world-wide commitments set out earlier in this Paper. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare satisfied that the numbers quoted for the Armed Forces and their supplyabove are the minimum required during the coming &quot;year for the fulfilment of commitments, for the training of the Forces in view of the rapid run-down of trained personnel, and for the arms and equipment without whichthey cannot be effective.17. The release scheme has transferred back into civil life and industry the great majority of the war intakes and in particular of the older men of whose skill and experience the civil economy has most need. But this processhas entailed internal reorganisation of the Armed Forces on a very widescale: ^ moreover, while this reorganisation proceeds, it is inevitable thatoperational efficiency is reduced, until such time as new intakes are trained and the regular Forces built up through voluntary recruitment. His Majesty&apos;3Government have in fact accepted an appreciable element of risk in imposing
upon the Services this rate of release. There is, however, a point beyond which the risk in denuding the Forces of their trained personnel becomesone which His Majesty&apos;s Government; cannot accept.iS. A new factor of the first importance was introduced by the decision ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government,. announced in the King&apos;s Speech at the openingof the present Session, to introduce in the near future into Parliament a Billfor continuing the system of national service in the Armed Forces. referring to this decision in the Debate on the Address, the Prime Minister indicated that the governing consideration which had influenced the Government wasthe likelihood that the rapid developments in modern warfare would rob thiscountry of that breathing space measured in years rather than in months by virtue of which alone in the past two great wars it has been enabled tobuild up its warlike strength and thus overcome its enemies. It is appro-priate here to quote the actual words used by the Prime Minister in the house on iath November, 1946:  &quot; The logic of that is that while we keep our front line Forces as lowas we can consonant with efficiency and the jobs they have to do, we musthave trained reserves who can take their part right away without waiting for six months training.&quot;19. The likely need in the unhappy event of a future war is for largenumbers of reserves available at short notice for the immediate tasks ofdefence. The process of building up reserves from regular personnel whoseengagements with the Colours have expired is slow, and is also productiveof small numbers, though of high quality. In addition to these regularreserves,, there will be the volunteer members of the auxiliary forces, forexample, the R.N.V.R., the Territorial Army, and the Auxiliary Air Force,for which recruitment will shortly begin, and by the speedy reconstitution ofwhich His Majesty&apos;s Government set the greatest store. It is. however, clearthat the additional numbers required can only be provided by a system ofnational service consisting of a minimum period with the Colours and several years of reserve service.20. A peacetime system of national service will make large demands uponthe regular Forces for personnel to train the new intakes, to administer them,and generally to deal with large numbers of men who in many ways will haveto be treated differently from the regulars, since their term in the Active forces will be short. His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise the special responsibilities which they will bear for ensuring that the time spent with the Forces by a young man under the national service scheme will not only serve the main purpose of making him a valuable asset to the country&apos;s defence, but willalso have a formative and generally helpful effect upon his ability to take his full place as a citizen at the expiry of his term of active service.VI.   PRODUCTION, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT21. General. Cmd. 6743 set out four principles which had been followedby His Majesty&apos;s Government in considering the supply of equipment for theforces.   These were: (a) Concentration on research;(b) The limited introduction of equipment of the most modern kind;(c) The maximum use of accumulated stocks;(d) The maintenance of a reasonable war potential.     . .His Majesty&apos;s Government will in the coming as in the current year be guided by these four principles.
22. The Joint War Production Staff and the Ministerial Production Com-mittee, which were set up on an informal basis as soon as possible after thedecision to establish a Ministry of Defence had been taken, have examined the production programmes of the Services for the financial year 1947-48.The following considerations principally influenced this examination: (a) The necessity in the interests of the restoration of the country&apos;economy and the revival of trade of limiting the production of war material to the minimum needed for current maintenance, for preservation ofnucleus war potential and for the introduction on a modest scale of thelatest types of equipment.(b) The need for a properly balanced allocation of production resourcesbetween the Services.23. The 1947 programme of the Royal Navy amounts to little more thanthe maintenance of the existing Fleet and the continuation at a reduced rateof the construction of ships already being built. In addition, a start hasbeen made with the re-equipment of the Naval Air Arm, which during thewar depended to a very large extent on American types of aircraft, the supplyof which has now ceased. Provision is made for the refit and repair of ships in full commission in order to keep them at operational efficiency, and forbeginning the refit of the large number of ships which owing to the urgent need of releasing men from the Forces were put into reserve without theirpreliminary refit. If these ships are not to suffer serious deterioration, theymust be taken in hand as soon as possible.24. The production programme for the Army is also principally made upof items required for essential maintenance. Production will be continuedof the most up-to-date types of armoured fighting vehicles, which will replacemodels now obsolescent. The importance of anti-aircraft defence has greatlyincreased with the development of intensified forms of attack from the air.The re-equipment of Anti-Aircraft Command with the latest type of equip-ment will therefore continue.. . &apos;     . &apos;    - \ &apos; \ -25. The Air Ministry programme provides for the continuation of the pro-gressive rearmament of the Royal Air Force with the most modern types ofjet-propelled&apos; fighter aircraft, and for a start to be made on the replacement of American transport aircraft and the introduction of a modern type forthe carriage of Airborne Forces. Some provision is also made for the replace-ment of obsolete training aircraft with modern types, a requirement of funda-mental importance to the efficiency of the post-war Royal Air Force.&apos; 26. Research and Development. The research and development programmes of the Admiralty and the Ministry of Supply for the financial year 1947-48provide for some expansion of effort in fundamental research in entirely newfields, as well as for continuation of work already in hand on the development and improvement of the most modern types of material which it is expectedwill remain part of the equipment of the post-war Forces.27. It needs no further emphasis at this time that His Majesty&apos;5 Governmentattaches the highest importance to the encouragement of scientific research and development, which is of particular importance at a time when economic considerations must limit expenditure on new equipment so severely, andso make it more than ever essential that maximum value for money is obtained. With the constitution of the Defence Research Policy Committee,a start has been made on the consideration of longer-range planning for defence research and development. Through its close link with the Chiefsof Staff, the Committee will be continuously aware of the latest concepts of
strategic and operational thought, and will itself he able to influence thoseconcepts by reason of its knowledge of future trends in the field of defencescience. From this collaboration will emerge a unified and comprehensiveview of the probable nature and methods of future warfare, on which His.Majesty&apos;s Government^ defence policy can be firmly grounded. The apoint-ment of Sir Henry Tizard as Chairman of the Advisory Council on scientific policy, in addition to his appointment as Chairman of the Defence ResearchPolicy Committee, will ensure that knowledge of developments over the wholefield of science will be pooled to the benefit both of the civilian community and of national defence.28. As well as dealing with long-term planning, the Defence ResearchPolicy Committee will study programmes for research and development formu-lated by the Service and Supply Departments in connection with thepreparation of Annual Estimates, and these programmes will thus be subjected to the same combined scrutiny as the departmental production programmes.29. In addition to its work on planning and programmes the Committeewill also have brought before it all problems which arise on the higherorganisation of defence research and development and on the requirementsof the Service and Supply Departments for scientific manpower, and alsomajor projects for new establishments. This will ensure that a common policy is followed and that unnecessary overlapping is avoided.VII.   FINANCE30. The financial provision proposed for 1947-48 is given below. since last year there have been two significant changes which affect the presentationin this Paper of the Ministry of Supply figures. In the first place, it hasbeen decided that the charges for production for the Armed Forces shall beborne on the Votes of the respective Service Departments and repaid bythem to the Ministry of Supply on lines to be laid down by- the Treasury.This means a very substantial reduction in the net total of the Estimate forthe Ministry of Supply. Secondly, the figures given below for the Ministryof Supply are restricted to their estimated expenditure on research and develop-ment with related works services, to that proportion of certain inspectionservices provided by the Ministry which is regarded as appropriate to thework undertaken on behalf of the Service Departments, and to terminal pay-ments in respect of war contracts,&apos; etc.31. With this explanation regarding the Ministry of Supply, the provision in Estimates relevant to the subject matter of the present paper is asfollows:  Navy   ...      ......      ...      ...      ......      196.7Army.........      ...      .........      388Air Force      ...      ...      ............      214Supply ......      ............      100.3899.032. Of the net total of  899 million,  118.5 million is incurred in respectof terminal charges for release leave and clothing, termination of contracts,compensation for land requisition, etc. The provision for net current expendi-ture is, therefore,  780.5 million.   Of this,  57.8 million is borne on the
Vote of the Ministry of Supply. The balance of  722.7 million,., borne onthe Votes of the three Service Departments, is distributed under the following main heads of expenditure:  **-Personnel       ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...    -a&amp;b. *Production 1Works.......Non-effective ...Miscellaneous 3...;     fa).    S33. The corresponding figures given in last year&apos;s White Paper as requiredfor the current financial year were, respectively)  576 million. for . terminalexpenditure,  1,091 million for current expenditure, producing a total of     v 1,667 million.   For the reasons mentioned in paragraph So , the figures are not strictly comparable.34. Much of the provision for research and development in the Ministry ofSupply Estimate is not properly attributable to defence purposes; it is con- &apos; 1cerned with such matters as civil aviation, radio research for civilian ends,and other forms of research and development which would proceed inde-pendently of any question of their application to the Services. The estimates of the Service Departments themselves also carry expenditure of various kinds for objects and purposes unrelated to defence needs in the coming year:such charges represent responsibilities undertaken by the Service Departmentsmainly for convenience of administration, e.g. the Polish Resettlement Corps.35. The broad estimate of the amount included in this respect in the nettotal of expenditure of the Service and Supply Departments given in the tables above is some  40 million.36. In considering these figures, emphasis should be laid upon the standing and other unavoidable charges which form so large a proportion of thefinancial provision for the Armed Forces. Apart from terminal charges,the major portion of the provision for the Armed Forces in the coming yearstill represents unavoidable expenditure given the assumption of Forces ofa specific size determined by the defence commitments of this country. . Forexample, the pay, food and clothing of the men and women in the Forcestogether with the pensions and gratuities of ex-regulars alone account for 3M-7 millions, and that without any allowance for their accommodation,movement, personal equipment, welfare and education. But numbers ofsailors, soldiers or airmen as such do not make a Navy, Army or Air Force.The personnel of the Services have to be trained and organised; their pay,accounts and records must be kept; their vehicles must be supplied and main--tained. Moreover, each of the three Services needs standing establishmentsfor its special activities: fojr example, the Navy must have Naval dockyardsfor the repair and maintenance of the fleet; the Army heavy workshops tokeep its tanks running: the aeroplanes of the .R.A.F. must be serviced andoverhauled.37. In comparing the 1947 provision with defence expenditure before thewar, account will naturally be taken in the first place of the legacies of thewar, namely, our abnormal military commitments overseas, and the immenseprogramme of training and re-grouping. In addition, however, it must beremembered that there have been major improvements since 1939 in the pay and allowances of the Armed. Forces. His Majesty&apos;s Government welcome the fact that service with the Forces is more adequately&apos; paid than beforethe war, but with a total of more than a million men under arms it is obviousthat improved conditions must mean substantially higher Defence Estimates.Including Admiralty research and development.Including food, oil fuel and other supplies, transportof personnel and stores;    reserve and auxiliary forces;    pay of civilians except those engaged on production.
38. Notwithstanding the careful scrutinies to which Service Estimates havebeen subjected, it remains true that in a year such as 1947-48, there are manyuncertainties which may affect the actual outcome of expenditure upon the armed Forces, and the possibility cannot be ruled out that the Governmentmay have to ask Parliament to make supplementary provision for the Servicesbefore the next financial year closes.VIII.   CONDITIONS OF SERVICE IN THE ARMED FORCES,39. During the six years of actual hostilities from the outbreak of war inSeptember, 1939, the resources of the Services had to be concentrated upon those purposes which directly served the prosecution of the war, and theimprovement of conditions of life in the Armed Forces which had been a feature of the pre-war years&quot; could hot be developed as it would have beenhad the peace of the world not been broken. Even in wartime everything possible, was done both to ensure the comfort and welfare of the Forces andto cater for their, educational needs and restricted leisure. In particular, theServices recognised the special responsibilities which they incurred throughthe presence in the Armed Forces of a large cross-section of the civil popula-tion, on temporary wartime engagements, and drawn from within a wide agebracket; as an instance, the education of the serving man in what may be termed &quot; citizenship &quot; was developed considerably during the war years,and the success attending these developments was such that they have&apos; inpart been applied to civilian purposes by outside organisations in the period since the war.40. But in such matters as improving the accommodation of the Forces,providing and modernising married quarters for Service families, provisionof club and entertainment facilities within the Services, improvement instandard ,as distinct from temporary provision for the vast expansion of theServices during the war was in abeyance. There have accumulated duringthe war years very considerable arrears of maintenance work on barracks and married quarters. The Service Departments have large programmes ofimprovement to accommodation for the Forces, but the realisation of these programmes will unavoidably be delayed by the need to concentrate on main-tenance and by general shortage of labour and materials. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are determined that the plans for improving accommodation forthe Forces shall go forward in step with the national housing programme; itwould not, however, be right for disproportionate resources to be allocated to the Service programmes while the housing shortage for the civil populationremains acute. The delays imposed by general shortages must not, however,obscure the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government have accepted, and are determined to carry out, plans for raising the living conditions of men in the armed Forces to a standard much higher than that of pre-war days. the realisation of this target in full is, however, a matter of years.41. More rapid progress has been made already with what may be termedthe &quot; humanisation &quot;of Service life. One or two examples may be quoted.Naval families are being provided with free passages to join men servingoverseas, if accommodation is available and the man&apos;s stay on the station is expected to be for an appreciable time: this brings the Navy into line withthe other Services. In the Services all unnecessary restrictions on freedomoff duty have been removed; e.g. there is now very little restriction on thewearing of plain clothes by personnel off duty. His Majesty&apos;s government intend to persevere with this policy and are convinced that such steps arenot only reconcilable with the maintenance of a high state of discipline in the armed Forces, but in fact help to achieve it,
x2 ;42. It has also been the concern of His Majesty&apos;s Government to ensurethat the Fighting Services are casting their net as widely as possible to attractto a professional career in the Navy, Army and Air Force a due proportionof the best of the country&apos;s youth. No candidate should be prevented bylack of means from obtaining a regular commission in the Armed Forces.The standard required of candidates is rightly high, both in education andin character and leadership; but the Government are confident that the righttype of young man can be attracted to the Forces, and there given a full andvaried life in which conditions, prospects and rewards do not compare unfavourably with those of civilian life and opportunities for education, anddevelopment of personality are not less than in the world outside.IIX.   CONCLUSION43. In this paper, an attempt has been made to deal more fully than hashitherto been possible with the defence policy of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the provision for the Armed Forces which are the instruments of that policy. Nineteen forty-seven will however still be a stage, and perhaps notthe final stage, in the transition from war to peace, and the immediate pre-oceupations of post-war settlement and revival of the national economy haveinevitably taken pride of place. But sight is not being lost of the need to plan our post-war defence policy, and an examination of the fundamentalissues is already in hand. This must take into account not only the develop-ments in warfare which new scientific advances have produced;, but also theeffect on national defence policy of the country&apos;s determination to play its part in the organisation for the prevention of war which is being worked outby the United Nations, including the effect on our own plans of any generally accepted scheme for the regulation and control of armaments.A-s-p*Feseut-TpKyblems-aFe--i)ro^g*essively-^0lved7--theeght-4s--being-ii*ereasJBgifconcentrated on the future, in order that Hj^Majesty^s-government may beable^to^djtermir^ the general structure of nationalxhe supreme object of British policy must &quot;be toprevent war,      &quot;he role of British forces must therefore he to deter aggression while at the sametime safeguarding Commonwealth and United kingdom interests against attack.
