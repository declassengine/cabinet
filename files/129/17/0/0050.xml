THIS DOCUMENT   IS   THE  PROPERTY  OF   HIS   BRITANNIC   MiUESTrs   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1947SECRET Copy No. (-*CP. (47) 10021st March, 1947CABINETEXHAUSTION OF THE DOLLAR CREDITMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerLAST Thursday (CM. (47) 30th Conclusions, Minute 5) I warned mycolleagues that we were racing through our United States dollar credit at areckless, and ever-accelerating, speed.2. This is not my first warning on this subject. Last February I-circulated a warning by the late Lord Keynes on the overseas deficit (CP. (46) 58) and,simultaneously, a paper by myself on the balance of payments for 1946(CP. (46) 53)V Again, on 23rd October (CP. (46) 401), I circulated a further,and slightly more strident, warning, indicating in emphatic language that wewere in serious danger of using up the United States and Canadian Creditstoo fast. Since then, the speed at which we have been exhausting these Creditshas been rapidly mounting, and the situation now shows every sign of going outof control, unless we face the facts and pull ourselves together. In three orfour weeks, I shall be submitting to the Cabinet proposals for the import programme from July 1947 onwards, in two six-monthly periods up to June1948. I ask, meanwhile, that no decision should be taken, involving a still more rapid exhaustion of the residue of the Credits.3. The United States Credit of $3,750 millions was finally granted in July1946. By the end of 1946 we had already drawn $600 millions. If this rate of drawing had been maintained, we should have exhausted the Credit in September1949. This, having regard to our difficulties, was a pretty poor prospect. But,since the beginning of 1947, we have drawn, a further $500 millions. On 1st April,in order to meet the ever-rising demands of the various Departments, the Treasurywill be compelled to draw a further $200 millions. This will only leave usS2.450 millions of the American Credit. I must underline to my colleagues the simple arithmetical truth that, if we continue from now on to draw these dollarsat the same rate at which we have been drawing them since 1st January, i.e., atthe rate of $700 millions a quarter, the United States Credit will now be exhausted in Februarj&apos; 1948.4. Even if we make some allowance for the fact that, at the beginning ofApril, we shall still have some unspent balances of our drawings in hand, wecannot spin out the United States Credit, at the present rate of spending, beyondJune, 1948. This is a looming shadow of catastrophe, and I will not have itsaid hereafter that I have left my colleagues unwarned until the eleventh hour.5. The chief reasons for this very rapid worsening, of our prospects are,first, the rapid rise in American prices, i.e., the rapid depreciation in value ofthe dollars lent to us, and, second (though this is partly a consequence of the depreciation of the dollar), our ever-rising dollar bill to feed the Germans. Sincethe loan was negotiated in December, 1945, the value of the dollar, as measured by American wholesale prices, has fallen by 30 per cent. In 1946, the British tax payer, even after allowing for dollar receipts from the sale of German exports,had to find some $60 millions to feed the Germans. It is, in itself, a mostunwelcome and unexpected mis-use of our American Credit. From January1947 to 1st April, a period of three months only, we shall have provided no lessthan a further $60 millions for this same high purpose. And we may have to[33353]
find another $30 millions on 1st April. At present, as an incident in the arrange-ment for the fusion of the British and American Zones, we are paying theAmerican share, as well as our own, of food supplies,&apos; particularly wheat, for both the Zones!6. If, and when, the American Congress votes the necessary appropriations,we should recover part of this excessive burden now falling on the British tax payer.7. The practical conclusions for immediate action are two: the export drive,sadly handicapped by the fuel shortage, must be sustained, and stimulated, to theutmost; on the other hand, the import programme must be kept within the mostsevere limits. This may mean the rejection of many attractive proposals, suchas an early increase in the sugar ration; but it will do the nation no good, in thishighly critical situation, to give temporary advantages which cannot be continued.I am, indeed, doubtful, on a preliminary study of the facts, whether we can afford to maintain, let alone increase, our present food supplies from dollar sources. Itis most important to switch, as much as we can, from dollar to non-dollar sources of supply. It is, of course, an illusion to suppose, as some seem to do, that importsbought from non-dollar sources do not have to be paid for by British exports.8. I therefore ask my colleagues to ponder deeply, and to be prepared forthe taking of hard, and difficult, but necessary, decisions in the early future.H. D.Treasiwy Chambers, S.W. 1,21st March, 1947.
