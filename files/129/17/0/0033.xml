IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)RET . COPY NO.Ahl) S3 CABINETh MARCH_.19.U7The  &quot;1939 Standard&quot; for Compensation on compulsory acquisition.Memorandum by the Minister of Town and Country Planning-1.      In his memorandum (CP. (hi) 82) the Chancellor proposes that the compensation on compulsory acquisition should hecurrent market value,  except in the case of the non-occupyingowner who has a right to possession.      I wish to submit forconsideration a modification of this proposal to exclude fromcompensation at full current market value also the owner-occupier.      The considerations which I have in mind are asfollow.2.      I recognise, that hardship is involved when an owner-occupier., whether of &quot;business premises or of a dwelling house,is dispossessed by compulsory purchase and has to find newacccmmodation5  and. by paying full market value we couldundoubtedly reduce to negligible proportions the resistance toc ornpuls cry pure ha s e .3.      On the other hand,  owner-occupiers whose houses or premiseswere not dostroyedduring the war ought not to be treated muchvaore favourably than those who have lost their buildings.      Thelatter will get only a h5% or 6o% supplement over 1939 prices,which normally will fall far short of current market value wherethere is a right of possession.k-     Much of the additional cost would fall on the localauthorities who are likely to regard the proposal as unnecessarilygenerous.      They will probably press for increased Exchequerassistance.      i do not know what the new block grant scheme willprovide, but I should expect,  in any event,  that my difficulties/in
in getting a grant scheme arranged with them under the new.Town and Country planning Bill would be aggravated,5.      There will undoubtedly be a presumption in many cases that the owner-occupier will have to find alternative accommodation, but that will not always be sc.      Elderlypeople, for instance, will often not sock either new business premises or new living accommodation;  and the ups and downsof business are likely to account for many more.      I did atone time consider whether full market value could be&apos; confined to cases where the money can be shown to have been spent onthe acquisition or building of alternative accommodation, butI do not believe that a practical scheme could be devised.It would be almost impossible to prevent acquisition in orderto get the extra compensation and resell; and if we were to limit it to building cases in the present state of shortagethe results would be indefensibly fortuitous, unless some arrangement could, be made to ensure first building priority to every owner-occupier who wanted it.      Thrit,  I imagine,would be very difficult.6.      Apart from those considerations,  it appears to me thatthe transfer of additional large sums of money into privatepockets is bound, unless these sums arc immediately turnedback into bricks and mortar,  to aggravate the presentinflationary tendency:; and where they are so turned back theywill at the least tend to peg,   if not raise,  the presentextortionate prices by increasing the number of buyers withenough money to compete  in. a seller &apos;s market.7.      I have had discussions on several occasions recently with representative members of the surveyors&apos;  and estate agents&apos;professions,  and find none of thorn in favour of full current market value in these scarcity inflation cases.      they recommend that words should be added to Rule 2 in Section 2 ofthe 1919 Acquisition of Land Act to provide that the vacant/possession
possession element of the value as fixed, under that Rule should first ho ascertained; and that so much of&apos;&apos;that element of value as results from the scarcity of property of the class inquestion and. is directly or indirectly attributable to the war should, be deducted from the compensation.      1 agree with themthat an attempt should be made to find a way of talcing atleast some of the scarcity inflation out of the,compulsory purchase price.    I have not seen the details on which theChancellor bases his proposal to do this Idj &quot;deeming theproperty to be subject to a lease of appropriate duration&quot;, buthe states that this will exclude from the purchase price thevalue of the right of possession.    I would not go as far asthat.      Not all of that value is due to scarcity inflationarising out of the war and I would try to limit the deductionin owner-occupier cases to the amount properly attributable tosuch inflation.S.      I suggest,  thereforeo for the consideration of mycolleagues,  that in owner-occupier cases the compensr^tion on compulsory purchase should,  instead of being full current market value, be reduced, in this way.    If the principle is accepted,  the details can be worked out in interdepartmentaldiscussion.L.S.Ministry of Town and Country planning.10th March,  1947&quot;.
