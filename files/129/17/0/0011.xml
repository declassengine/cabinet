IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)SECRET1D.P.(UZl 61                                                                     COPY NO. &apos;/--- -rI6TH FEBRUARY,   19U7CABINETINDUCEMENTS FOR GOAL MINERSMemorandum by the Minister of Food---------------I believe that measures which will increase the relativeattractiveness of the coal mining industry should today take -priority in our minds over almost everything else.    I suggestthat every Minister should, see whether his Department cannot make some contribution to this end.I accordingly suggest that wc should immediately increasethe rations  to the 700,000 coal miners by (say) 8 ozs.  of sugarper week and U ess. of fat,  and should grant each miner an   ^extra 8 points per month.    These concessions would cost,125 tens of sugar and U,o62 tons of fat per year.    Neithersugar nor fats are in easy supply but the above tonnagesrepresent only about vr per cent respectively of our presentannual usages, so that the concession does net make muchdifference to the supply position one way or the other.There is no difficulty about supplying the extra points foodsDetails cf these proposals are being worked cut in myDepartment as a matter of urgency.Needless to soy after cur experience over meat I am well aware of the difficulties which these proposals will create.Nevertheless I believe that in present circumstances thecountry will strongly suppcrt them.I am far from suggesting that the above two concessions on rationed foodstuffs will in themselves provide r.nadequate incentive to men to stay in,  or to join,  themining industry, but they are the best contribution whichdepartmentally I can suggest.On the other hand,  these measures are, in themselves.,quite inadequate and I return to the suggestion that thetime has come when it is imperative tjtat we should face the necessity of paying miners higher wages.    Again allthe difficulties and repercussions are clear.    Nevertheless:the country will not forgive us if we watch passively andimpotently the maldistribution of our labour forces asbetween different industries to the point where it causesmass unemployment.    And this point has now been reached.It is agreed that unless we can increase the relativeattractiveness cf the rrunihg industry, which in the longrun must bo a pre-requisite to raising the output of coal,we must come to disaster.    Yet we are not offering theinducements by which we can alone effect this purpose.
The only other way cf increasing the relativeattractiveness of the mining industry is the old way,employed by our political opponents between the wars,of maintaining mass unemployment, particularly in themining areas.    Then even a miserably paid mining indusrty was relatively attractive,  and men went down the pitsrather than half starve on the dele.    1 re are energeticallydoing the opposite of this by our policy cf planting lightindustries in all the development areas,  i.e.  in most ofthe coal fields.    Unless we,  at the same time and to anadequate degree,  raise the relative attractiveness cfthe mining industry we cannot fail to produce disaster.J, S.Ministry of Food, S.7. &quot;I.16TH FEBRUARY,  19h7
