(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1s GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (-17) 5-510th February,   194?CABINETTHE FUTURE OF Cyprus memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of Statefor the colonies my colleagues will recall that my predecessor,  ina paper submitted to the Cabinet in July last (CP; (46) 260)ut forward certain proposals for the adoption of a moreiberal policy in regard to the internal affairs of Cyprus.At the same time he drew attention to the serious situationin the Island resulting from doubts about the intentions ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government with regard to  the future of the island and expressed the view that  it was essential that .in any announcement of future policy it should be made clear that there, is -no intention..of transferring the Islandfrom British sovereignty.2. In deference to considerations put forward by theForeign Secretary,  it was ultimately decided that no statement should be made at that stage about  the future status of the island,  and in the announcement of policy that I made in theHouse of Commons in October last,  a copy of which is attached,I dealt only with the matters referred, to in paragraph 4 ofthe Cabinet Memorandum CP. (46) 260.      In agreement with theForeign Secretary,  I have said in reply to questions  inParliament on future status  that &quot;no change is contemplated&quot;.3. Unfortunately the situation in Cyprus has notimproved with the lapse of time.      The statement of policy ofOctober last was well received  in this country, but I am advised by the Governor that it was received with littleenthusiasm in Cyprus and its prospects of success continueto be gravely prejudiced by the general feeling thatHis Majesty1s Government arc in fact uncertain in their intentions as regards the future status of the Island.The campaign for union with Greece continues unchecked;the loyalty of the Civil Service and of all who are sympathetic to the British connection remains severely strained.      Adeputation claiming widely to represent all sections of cyprus opinion has come to this country and urged inemphatic terms that the United Kingdom should without delaytransfer the sovereignty eignts^ to Greece.      I am assured that wecannot look for co-operation from the people of Cyprus inthe carrying out of our policy of either constitutional reform or economic and social development in the presentatmosphere.      The only hope of some degree of co-operationi t iCOPY NO. I
is a precise and definite announcement that the Colony isto remain oriel or British sovereignty; -4. For these reasons I p.rn anxious about developments in Cyprus.      It seems that,  unless the issue of status  is placed beyond question at this stage.,  our policy will beabortive.      Lord Winster  after many consultations with those most competent to judge also feels that a statement of intention is an essential preliminary to the successful prosecution of the policy which he has been appointed tocarry out.      I do not,  of course,  overlook the difficulties with which the Foreign Secretary is faced,  and I would ask the guidance of my colleagues in this difficult matter.A.C. - J.Colonial Office,  S.W.I.10th February,  1947.
Annex46Sj^vtcment by Secretary of State for the colonies in&quot; jiejjj-X,&quot;JL2Question in the House of Commons on 3rd October&quot;.  1946.      TcTmlcial Report, Col. 596-7)CYPRUS__(GOVERNMENT POLICY)MR. COLLINS asked the Secretary of State for theColonies whether he is now in a position to make a general statement ahout future policy in Cyprus.MR. CREECH-JONES:    Yes, Sir.      His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have recently had under review the question oftheir future policy in regard to Cyprus, with a view toseeking opportunities to establish a more liberal and progressive regime in the internal affairs of the island.,with this object,  I xrropose to invite the Governor,  Sir Charles&apos;Woolle;r, who is in full accord with this policy,  to calltogether s Consultative Assembly, drawn from representativeelements in the island, to consider the framing of proposalsfor constitutional reform    including the re-establishment ofa Central Legislature.      It is hoped that the result will bethe creation of a Council which will bring: representatives ofthe Cypriot people into full consultation with the Governmentin the conduct of their local affairs.His Majesty;&apos;s Government are also determined topress on with vigour the programme of economic development and social welfare, which has been successfully initiatedduring recent years.      I have had before me a. systematic and detailed plan of development covering- the next ten years.It has been under close&quot;examination in the Colonial Officeand is being published in Cyprus today.      This plan deals with every aspect of the island&apos;s life and economy - agricultureand irrigation, the forests, medical and education services,the expansion of the ports,  the- provision of tourist facilities and so&apos; on.There are two further matters on which I can alsoannounce decisions.      The first relates to the situation atpresent existing in the Church of Cyprus,  of which theArchiepiscopal See has now been vacant for many years.There seems little doubt that the three local laws enacted in1937 with the object of controlling certain aspects of theelection of a new Archbishop have impeded the settlement ofthis problem.      The retention of these laws would seem nolonger to be  justifiable,   and,  on the advice and with the fullconcurrence of the Governor, His Majesty&apos;s Government have now decided that they should be repealed as soon as practicable.It is to be hoped that,   as a result of this action on thepart of the Government,  the Church of Cyprus will find itself   &apos;able to make an election to the vacant See and thus resolvea situation which,  so long as it continues, must be prejudicial to its spiritual authority and  influence.Finally,  the Government consider that the  time hasnow come to permit the return to Cyprus of those persons whowere deported from the Island for their part in the disturbancesof 1931.      His Majesty&apos;s Government earnestly hope that these measures will inaugurate, a new and happier era in the relationsbetween this country and  the people of Cyprus,  and that they will now wholeheartedly join in the task of developing the Island&apos;resources and bettering their own conditions.
