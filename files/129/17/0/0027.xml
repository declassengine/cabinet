(45) 264), the Prime Ministerapproved the appointment of a Committee of Ministers under my Chairmanship,composed of the Home Secretary, the Minister of Health, the Minister ofEducation, the Minister of Town and Country Planning, the Lord Advocate, the attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, with the following terms ofreference : &apos;&apos; To consider whether there are grounds for an enquiry into the systemof administering civil justice in Great Britain, with a view to reducingthe cost of litigation; and to make recommendations to the Cabinet regardingthe scope of any such enquiry and the means by which it could best becarried out.&quot; The Committee will, in particular, consider whether there is needfor a special enquiry into the costs and delays involved in divorce proceed-ings; and may, if desired, make an interim report to the Cabinet on this aspect of the matter.&quot;2. The first work which the Committee undertook wa,s in connexion withdivorce. The First Interim Report of the Committee (CP. (46) 56 of8th February, 1946) dealt with the question of Service Divorce cases, and theSecond Interim Report (CP. (46) 191 of 8th May, 1946) recommended the appoint-ment of a Committee under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice Denning to examine and report on the procedure and practice in the Divorce Division. The InterimReports of that Committee have been substantially carried into effect, and thequestion of giving effect to the recommendations of the Committee&apos;s Final report is under active consideration.3. The Cabinet Committee have now considered the first part of their termsof reference, and have come to the conclusion that it would be desirable to appointtwo separate Committees to investigate this problem in the sphere of the SupremeCourt and of the County Court respectively.4. On behalf of the Committee I submit, for the consideration of mycolleagues, our Final Report. I recommend that I should be authorised toproceed to the appointment of the two Committees suggested in the Report.J.House of Lords, S.W. 1,Uh March, 1947.[332591
SUPREME COURT AND COUNTY COURTFinal Report of the Committee on the Reform of Legal procedure. We ihave now considered the first paragraph of our terms of reference and recommend, for the approval of the Cabinet, the appointment of two separateCommittees to investigate this problem in the sphere of the Supreme Court andof the County Court respectively. We are satisfied that there is need for suchan investigation, both in the Supreme Court and the County Court. Theproceedings of the Denning Committee so far as they related to practice and procedure were limited to the Divorce Division of the High Court. Theyundoubtedly met with general approval, and suggestions have been made, inParliament and in the Press, that a thorough overhaul of practice and procedure in other Divisions of the Supreme Court, and in the County Court, is likely to result in a reduction in the cost of litigation.Supreme Court committee. The terms of reference which we suggest for the Supreme CourtCommittee are as follows : 1. To enquire into the present practice and! procedure of the SupremeCourt (excluding the practice and procedure in matrimonial proceedings in the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court butincluding the practice and procedure on appeals from that Division), andto consider what reforms of such practice and procedure should now beintroduced, whether by legislation or otherwise, for the purposes of reducingthe cost of litigation and securing greater efficiency and expedition in thedespatch of business.2. To consider the Reports made by the Hanworth Committee on theBusiness of the Courts (Cmds. 4265, 4471 and 5066) and the Report of theRoyal Commission on the Despatch of Business at Common Law, 1934-36(Cmd. 5065), and, for the purposes set out in the foregoing paragraph, tomake recommendations generally on the proposals contained in those Reports.3. To consider, for the purposes aforesaid, whether any, and if so what,modifications should now be made in the present rights of appeal to, from or within the Supreme Court other than appeals in matrimonial proceedingsfrom Courts of summary jurisdiction.4. To consider what appropriate machinery might be evolved to enablecases involving points of law of exceptional public interest (arising in anyDivision of the High Court or in the Court of Appeal) to be determinedwholly or partly at the public expense, whether by making the Attorney-General or the King&apos;s Proctor a part)&apos;&quot; to litigation or otherwise.5. To make interim reports on any matter or matters arising out oftheir terms of reference as may from time to time appear to the Committeeto merit immediate attention or to warrant separate treatment.3. With regard to the personnel of the Supreme Court Committee, we recom-mend that the selection be left to the Lord Chancellor, but that it should be constituted on the following lines : iMr. Justice Evershed (Chairman)Mr. Justice Lynskey.King&apos;s Bench Master.Chancery Master.Taxing Master.I Two barristers (not Members of Parliament).\ Two solicitors.jI Two Members of Parliament (laymen).Business man, e.g., an Underwriter or a Member of the institute of Chartered Accountants or a Member of the British chambers of Commerce.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9101112
13.   A representative of the Trade Union Congress.14.   An expert on comparative legal systems, e.g., Professor Sir ArthurGoodhart, K.C.15.   An economist (e.g., Mr.  Marshall of the London School of economics).4. We feel that with a Committee of this size, who are to deal with a technical subject with which some of the members are not acquainted, it wouldbe difficult to achieve that expedition which seems to us to be necessary. Wetherefore recommend that the Lord Chancellor should suggest to the Chairmanthat he and four or five other members acquainted with the technicalities involved should be set up by the main Committee as a Sub-Committee to do the preliminary work and to report to the main Committee. The Committee will also be invitedto make interim Reports on any matters requiring urgent attention, or which;Qan be separately dealt with, so that there need be no delay in waiting for a comprehensive Report.County Court Committee5. The terms of reference which we suggest for the County Court Committeeare as follows : &quot; To enquire into the present practice and procedure of the county court, and to consider what reforms might be introduced with a view to reducing the cost of litigation and for securing greater efficiency in thedespatch of business.&quot;8. We suggest that the composition of this Committee should be on thefollowing lines, the details of which should be left to the Lord Chancellor : Mr. Justice Jones (Chairman).Judge David Davies.Judge Pugh.A London County Court Registrar.A provincial County Court Registrar.^ Two barristers.j- Two solicitors (one with special experience of Poor Persons work).I Two Members of Parliament.Representative of the Trades Union Congress or the Mineworkers&apos;Federation or the National Union of Railwaymen.Representative of the British Employers&apos; Confederation.Representative of the National Council of Social Service.7. We recommend that, for a speedier despatch of the problems, a Sub-Committee of this Committee should similarly be set up by the main Committee.Signed on behalf of the Committee : ,JOWITT,Chairman.4th March, 1947.1.2.3.4.9.10.11.12.13.14.
