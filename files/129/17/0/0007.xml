this document is the  PBOPEBTY OF HIS britannic MiySSTY^-GQg-EOT-Ml^printed for the Cabinet.   February 1947Copy No-   /CABINETBILL TO AMEND THE FOREIGN MARRIAGE ACT, 1892Memorandum by the Secretary of State for AirSection 22 of the Foreign Marriage Act, 1892, reads as follows : &quot; It is hereby declared that all marriages solemnised within the Britishlines by any chaplain or officer or other person officiating under the orders of the commanding officer of a British army serving abroad, shall be asvalid in law as if the same had been solemnised within the United Kingdom,with a due observance of all forms required by law.&quot;2. The Treasury Solicitor in 1925 advised that an air force overseas couldbe deemed to be &quot;a British army serving abroad &quot; for the purpose of thestatute. On that footing about 75 marriages have been solemnised by Royal AitForce chaplains within the lines. Seventeen marriages have also been solemnisedby naval chaplains within the lines on the Mediterranean stations and elsewhereduring the war.3. The Law Officers of the Crown in a recent opinion have expressed doubt as to whether a Royal Air Force unit serving abroad could be treated as &quot; aBritish army serving abroad &quot; and as to whether the naval chaplains referredto in paragraph 2 above were acting under the orders of the army commanding officer.In the view of the Law Officers the validity of the marriages in questionis therefore doubtful and they have advised that Section 22 of the ForeignMarriage Act, 1892, should be amended with retrospective effect.4. On 29th November, 1946, I submitted to the Legislation Committee amemorandum (H.P.C. (46) 99) suggesting a short and urgent Bill amendingSection 22 for the purpose of validating retrospectively the marriages celebratedby air force and naval chaplains referred to in paragraph 2 above. At the meeting-of the Legislative Committee on 3rd December (H.P.C. (46) 32nd Meeting,Minute 1), the Lord Chancellor observed that the proposed Bill raised a questionof policy inasmuch as the retrospective validation of marriages might, wherethe parties had subsequently married, lead to the result that these later, but legallyvalid marriages, would become bigamous. Further, the representative of theForeign Office mentioned that other difficulties had arisen as regards the inter-pretation of Section 22 which might be dealt with at the same time, and thatit was possible that there were other sections of the Act which required amend-,ments of a simple and non-controversial character which it would be expedient to include in the Bill. In consequence, the Legislation Committee decided thatthere should be further consultation between the interested parties and thatthe question of policy should be submitted to the Cabinet.5. As regards the question of policy referred to in paragraph 4 above, Iunderstand that the Lord Chancellor agrees that, as the parties to these marriageshave no reason to doubt their validity, it is most unlikely that any of them haveremarried, and if they have, they cannot have married in good faith. In fact, no case of such a remarriage is known. In so far as the danger pointed out by theLord Chancellor exists, it might be regarded as an argument for the speedypassing of the measure.SECRETCP.

6. The opportunity has been taken, in consultation with other interested departments, to review Section 22 and to consider what other simple but necessary amendments of the Act could be made now. Particulars of the provisions pro-posed for inclusion in the Bill, with detailed notes thereon, are set out in the annex and I request the authority of the Cabinet for the circulation to theLegislation Committee of an urgent Bill on the lines indicated.7. The First Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for War, theForeign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Registrars-General concur in these proposals. TheBill will be very short, consisting of only three or four clauses, and should be non-controversial.P. J. N-B.Air Ministry, S.W. 1,12th February, 1947.ANNEXProvisions proposed for Inclusion in the Bill with Notes thereon(a) A provision validating retrospectively marriages purported to be celebratedunder Section 22 of the Foreign Marriage Act, 1892, by Air Force midNaval chaplains.These marriages have been entered into in the belief, both of the parties concerned and the authorities, that they were valid. The difficulty has arisenbecause the Law Officers have recently held that the section probably does not cover the Air Force and Navy but the Army only.(b) The repeal of the existing Section 22 and its replacement by a more suitablesection on the lines indicated in (c) beloiv.The Law Officers, in the opinion mentioned in paragraph 3 of the Paper,recommended that Section 22 should be reviewed.   Consultation between theDepartments has revealed that the existing section is open to doubt on other points; inter alia, (i) whether it is confined to marriages celebrated &apos;&apos; within the lines &apos;: ofan army serving outside His Majesty&apos;s Dominions;(ii) whether it applies when neither of the parties to the marriage is aBritish subject or a member of or connected with the British Army. (The LawOfficers advised in 1936 that Section 22 was not confined to cases where one ofthe parties was a member of the army but that strong arguments could be putforward for the view that one of the parties must be a British subject. Sincethe Law Officers were not of the opinion that marriages, where neither of theparties was a British subject, were invalid, but merely thought an argumentto that effect could be put, it is not considered necessary to validate such marriagesretrospectively under the proposed Bill); and(iii) as regards the extent of the control in detail of the Army Commanderover these marriages.(c) A provision that, in future, a marriage shall be valid if it is celebrated by a naval, Army or Air Force chaplain (or other officer specially authorised for this purpose by the commander) between parties one of whom is amember of the Services in foreign territory, provided that the marriagescomply with such other conditions as may be laid down by His majesty in Council.There never has been any right to a marriage under Section 22 in the sense that any party could declare that he fulfilled the conditions of the section andtherefore had a right to be married under it. Section 22 only validated marriagescelebrated within the lines without conferring any right to be so married. It isnot proposed to create any such right. The proposal is to create facilities forthe marriage of Service personnel of a more satisfactory character than those provided under the present Section 22. It is thought that this facility shouldbe confined to cases where one of the parties is a member of or at any rate
connected with the Services. It might be left to His Majesty in Council to define the expression &apos;&apos; member of the Services &apos;&apos; (Dominion forces will have tobe excluded) and in particular to decide whether, and to what extent, ancillarypersonnel, some of whom are civilian employees or other persons in HisMajesty&apos;s service, should be included. It is proposed that the Order in council should also regulate any further conditions that may seem desirable, in particular the question of the authority required for the celebration of the marriage. Satis-factory provision should also be made for the registration of marriages socelebrated.The intention is to restrict the facility to marriages in foreign territory, i.e.,outside the United Kingdom or any colony or other territory administered by any government of His Majesty, unless that territory has been under the occupationof the enemy and civil administration has not been re-established. There is no more reason for granting the marriage facility conferred by Section 22 to forcesserving in territories under His Majesty&apos;s sovereignty or administration than there is for granting it to forces serving in the United Kingdom itself.(d) The repeal of Section 12 and of part of Section 21 (1) (e) of the Act of 1892.Section 12 provides for marriages celebrated on board one of His Majesty&apos;s ships, and Section 21 (1) (e) provides, inter alia, that regulations may be madefor this purpose. No regulations have ever been made and the Admiralty would prefer that these provisions should be repealed, leaving naval marriages to be covered by the proposal in (c).(e) The addition of a second sub-section to Section 18 to the effect that provisionmay be made by Order in Council for the Registrars-General to receivecopies of the records of marriages between parties, one of whom is aBritish subject, celebrated in foreign countries under the local law, evenif the consul has not been present at the marriage, and to issue certifiedcopies for use in this country, such copies to be evidence of the marriageceremony without any further proof.Section 18 provides for the registration by consuls of marriages celebratedin foreign countries in accordance with the law of those countries when the consul has been present at the marriage ceremony and satisfied himself that theprovisions of the local law have been fulfilled, and renders marriages so regis-tered as valid is this country as if the consul himself had celebrated them underthe provisions of the earlier part of the Act.The Foreign Office state that the need for a provision on the lines of (e)above has been felt generally for a considerable time, and the Control office have stressed the need for such a provision without delay in view of the presence in Germany and Austria of a very large number of British civilian personnelengaged in Allied Military Government.(f) A small amendment to Section 4 (1) providing that the Secretary of state may dispense with the necessity of obtaining the consent of parents orguardians for the marriage of a. minor by consuls in cases where theseparents and guardians are not available.The Registrar-General or Superintendent Registrar has a similar power in connection with marriages in England and Wales (the question does not arise in Scotland) but, by reason of the repeal of the relevant provisions of the MarriageAct, 1823, by the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1925, the dispensing with suchconsents for marriages by consuls is not always possible. The Foreign secretary would like this amendment to be made, and considers that it could be regardedas completely non-controversial. In itself, it cannot be said either to be urgentor important because the cases which arise are not numerous.
