Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1947CP. (47) 753rd March, 1947CABINETSOUTH PERSIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall that in July 1946, when the internal situationin Persia was&apos; such that there was a grave and imminent risk that seriousdisturbances might arise in South Persia, which would be likely to threaten the lives of the British and Indian employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil company and disrupt the flow of our essential oil supplies, they authorised the despatch from India to Southern Iraq of a brigade group known as Force 401. (cabinet conclusions of 15th July, 1946, CM. (46) 68.)I now recommend that : (1) The Government of India should be asked for their agreement to thewithdrawal of Force 401 without replacement as soon as the Ambas-ambassador in Tehran confirms that the maintenance of that force in southern Iraq is no longer necessary.(2) The Foreign Office, in consultation with the other Departments con-cerned, should consider the desirability of making a public announce-ment about the withdrawal of Force 401 and the form of any announcement which may be found necessary.(3) As soon as Force 401 has been withdrawn, the withdrawal of theremaining land forces in Iraq should be resumed.(4) The Chiefs of Staff should be invited to prepare an outline standingplan for action in South Persia in case serious disturbances shouldoccur in the future.I put forward these recommendations for the following reasons :  Recommendation 1. Firstly, in recent months the situation in Persia hasgreatly improved and the Ambassador at Tehran has now recommended that, ifthe present Persian Prime Minister obtains a majority in the new PersianParliament, the position will be sufficiently stable for it to be not only possible but desirable for Force 401 to be withdrawn from Southern Iraq. I am inagreement with the Ambassador.Although the Persian elections are not yet over, the indications are thatthe present Persian Prime Minister will have a majority in the new Parliament.Secondly, it so happens that for administrative reasons the Government ofIndia have not been able to maintain the force at Basra at its original strengthand it must now be considered!, owing to repatriation of men due for release,as inoperative.Recommendation 2. It was suggested by the Ambassador in Tehran that apublic announcement about the withdrawal of Force 401 should be made. Thisrequires rather careful consideration and i would suggest that it should be leftto my Department, in consultation with the other Departments concerned andthe Government of India, and if necessary after further reference to Tehran,to decide as to whether or not any public announcement is necessary or desirable.The terms of any such announcement would, of course, need to be agreed withthe Government of India before issue.13924   [33240]
Recommendation 3. Apart from Force 401, there is at Basra the remnantof the war-time garrison Which we maintained in Iraq. -They are engaged inguarding and disposing of the base installations which we set up during the warThe disposal of these installations and the evacuation of the forces concerned wasto have been completed by 31st May, 1947, but this evacuation was halted by the arrival of Force 401, as many of the installations concerned were required for thpmaintenance of this force.It is the intention of the Service authorities to resume evacuation of Iraq bythese troops as soon as Force 401 is withdrawn, since it is not considered that circumstances justify the retention of this body of troops in Southern Iraq, nor is there any provision in the existing Anglo-Iraqi Treaty for the location of Britishland-forces in Iraq in peace-time. Moreover, this would effect an economy in overseas spending.Recommendation 4. There will thus shortly be no British land forces inIraq. It is, however, unfortunately not possible to assume that there will neverin any circumstances be disturbances in South Persia which might compel us totake action. It therefore seems essential that the Service authorities should pre-pare in broad outline a standing plan for the despatch of troops for the protectionof British life and property in the oilfields area, which could be put into effect ifever required. The&quot; carrying out of such a plan would depend on Iraqi co-opera-tion, since the troops would have to be sent through or over Iraq. Provided thatour relations with Iraq remain on their present satisfactory footing, there is areasonable prospect that the Iraqi Government may agree to afford, whenrequested to do so, all possible facilities for the movement of our forces in transitacross Iraq.E. B.Foreign Office, 3rd March, 1947.
