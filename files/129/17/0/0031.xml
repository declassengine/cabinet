IS  DOCUMENT   IS   THE  PROPERTY   OF   HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY S   GOVERNMENT /Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1947 1 7 9S303X: Copy No. 2 9CP. (47) 8126*A March, 1947INTERNATIONAL METEOROLOGICAL organisation memorandum by the Secretary oe State fop. Air1. I have recently been discussing with the Foreign Secretary, and someothers of my colleagues, the question of making increased provision for inter-national meteorological research and of strengthening the present InternationalMeteorological Organisation. Before leaving for Moscow, the Foreign Secretarywrote to me, saying that he regarded this subject as very important, and askingme to look into the possibility of obtaining Cabinet decisions on certain out-standing points, with the idea that he would then be in a position to refer these points to his colleagues at the Conference of the Foreign Ministers in Moscow.I accordingly submit the following observations for consideration.2. Meteorological work is often regarded as primarily of interest toaviation. In many countries, as here, the Meteorological Office is under thedirection of the Air Ministry. The most important new step in international co--operation in recent times has just been taken by P.I.C.A.O., namely, a schemefor weather ships in the Atlantic.3. But meteorology and, in particular, weather forecasts, are of interestnot only to those engaged in aviation, both military and civil, but also to naviesand merchant fleets, railways, road transport, agriculture, the film industry andmany more. Even a small advance in accurate weather forecasting might give an immense return, e.g., in. the saving of agricultural crops or in giving time toprepare for transport difficulties such as those we have recently endured.4. Meteorology, in its day-to-day application, by its nature, must not onlybe international but intercontinental. Only by collecting information from theworld at large can any one nation secure a useful result.It is, of course, of great importance that Meteorological Services should adopt the same methods and should be of an equally high standard in allcountries.5. It is admitted that the science of meteorology is in its infancy. It alsomust of its nature be international. Research stations are needed in all conti-nents and no doubt there are countries which cannot, from their own resources,produce the scientists or finance all the equipment and research which arerequired.6. Responsibility for the international co-ordination of scientific meteoro-logical research rests with the International Meteorological Association, which forms part of the International Council of Scientific Unions. Arrangements forlinking this body to U.N.E.S.C.O. are in progress.7.   There is in existence also a body called the International MeteorologicalOrganisation.  It is a voluntary association of the Directors of the MeteorologicalServices of 84 States and Dependencies.[33364]
This Organisation has (a) A ConferenceBefore 1939 this Conference met every six years.(b) International Meteorological committee this Committee consists of twenty-five members elected by theConference of Directors, together with the Presidents of TechnicalCommissions.   It met normally every three years.-(c) Executive CouncilThis consists of six members and meets once a year.(d) Regional CommissionsThere are six Regional Commissions, broadly one per continent.(e) Technical CommissionsThere are ten Technical Commissions dealing with aerology, climatology,agricultural meteorology, &amp;c.(f) SecretariatThis is a small body located at Lausanne. The scale of its operationsis shown by the fact that the British contribution is approximately  250 perannum.8. The Soviet Union belong to the I.M.O. and have supported it war inly,in spite of the fact that Spain and Portugal belong.9, Last year the Soviet Union proposed that the I.M.O. should be broughtinto some relation with the United Nations. The LM.O. instructed its President(Sir Nelson Johnson, Director of the United Kingdom Meteorological Office) toget into touch with U.N.O. to ascertain what the conditions of &quot;affiliation&quot;would be before the Organisation decided upon further action. Discussions aretaking place, but no definite decision can be reached until the I.M.O. meets nextSeptember.10. The I.M.O. has likewise drawn up an International Conventionformalising, but not materially changing, the existing constitution. ThisConvention is due for signature by members at a Conference of Directors ofMeteorological Services in Washington in September 1947.11. It may, or may not be, desirable that this Convention should be signedand ratified and that a &quot; formal agreement &quot; should be made between the UN.and the I.M.O. But it is certainly desirable that the international organisationof meteorological information should be organised on a larger scale and with greater resources than have hitherto been devoted to it.Recommendation12. I therefore recommend that the Foreign Secretary should be invited todiscuss with his United States and Soviet colleagues in Moscow the question ofsecuring more effective international co-operation in applied meteorology thannowr exists. The type of reform I have in mind is that the International Meteoro-logical Organisation should be strengthened by the appointment of a full-timeSecretary-General, under whom there would be a full-time Administrative andTechnical planning Section as well as the present Secretariat. The Secretary-General would report to the President, who need not be a full-time appointment.If the United States and Soviet Union agree in principle, we could then workout in detail what the next practical step should be. We shall still have ampletime to put well-considered proposals before the Assembly of the United nations in September if, in the light of discussions in Moscow, we desire to do so.P. J.
