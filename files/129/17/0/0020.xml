[ct-      ,:;....i,I]A,...At....Gj^.jfgt*/(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET COPY NO.CP. (47) 7026TH FEBRUARY,  1947 J g 02ABJJNETSHIPPING FOR MIGRANTS TO AUSTRALIAMemorandum &quot;by the Minister- of transport the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theMinister of Labour and National Service consulted my department in the preparation of their Paper on this subject, CP. (47) 67.2. In agreeing to the proposals regarding provision ofshipping I have taken into account the actual and potentialdemands upon our passenger shipping in the near future whichare known to me.      The fact is that the passenger shipping a tour disposal is quite inadequate to meet all the demands thatare being- made upon it from various quarters.       The provisionof shipping for migrants to Australia is only one of severalrequests for traffic of this kind from the Dominions.      Forexample,  I have been pressed recently to increase the accommoda-tion for emigrants to South Africa,  a policy to which field marshal Smuts attaches high importance and which is obviouslyvital to our connexions.       I am now faced with a similar request from the New Zealand Government.      At the same time I have to try to meet other exceptional demands for passenger tonnagebaclted by the Foreign Secretary,  the Colonial Secretary,  andthe Secretary of State for India,  and I am expecting requeststo provide extra shipping; to bring over from the Continentpersons recruited by the Minister of Labour,  and sooner or later, for moving other displaced persons from Europe.      all this comes on top of the requirements of the Service Departments,and the need to resume our passenger services throughout theworld,  largely in the interest of our trade and commerce.      Ipropose in the circumstances to institute another PersonnelShipping Review, such as we had last year,  in which,  inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, we can establish an order of priority for the use of our limited passengershipping resources.      I bring this situation to the notice ofthe Cabinet at this stage to make clear that,   in making provision as proposed for Australian migrants,  it follows thatlj..-we shall have so much the less shipping for other purposes.3. So long as this point is understood,  I am agreeable tothe proposals regarding the &quot;RANCHI&apos;&quot;, &quot;CHITRAL&quot;  and &quot;ORMONDE&quot;.As regards the &quot;AQUITANIA&quot; ,  it may be that the australian government, who have deeply committed themselves in public, willelect to proceed despite our declining to bear any part of the abnormal expenditure, but other exceptional demands upon ourpassenger tonnage in connexion with India which have arisensince CP. (47) 67 was prepared now make it necessary for me tokeep open for the time being the oossibility of retaining the&quot;AQUITANIA&quot;   in our service for some little time longer.      Sheis still under requisition!    and we should not, for the. timebeing,  commit ourselves to immediate release for the Australiantraffic.A.B.Ministry of Transport.26th February,  1947.
