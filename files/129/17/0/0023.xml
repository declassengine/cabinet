uDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)8 E 0 RETC. P. (47) 751ST MARCH,   1947ELECTRICITY SUPPLY NATIONALISATION bill memorandum by the Minister&apos; of Fuel and PowerWhen the draft Electricity Bill was before theCabinet at their meeting on 19th December, 1946 (CM. (46) 107thConclusions, Minute 5) I warned my colleagues that LocalAuthorities were not likely to be content to be compensatedin respect of their electricity undertakings on the basis of&quot;net outstanding debt&apos;&apos; and that at a later stage I might haveto seek approval for some provision for additional compensation.8. During the Second Reading Debate on the ElectricityBill there was considerable criticism of the net debt basisfrom both sides of the House of Commons, particularlydirected towards the fact that the electricity undertakings of Local Authorities were being acquired at a figure farbelow either their cost or their present value.      these arguments have been repeated in the Press and in representa-tions to me, together with the further complaint that thesurplus funds (including the reserves) of these undertakings which,,  subject to certain limitations,  could have been usedto reduce charges, will now be merged in the generalresources of the new Boards and probably no longer beavailable for the specific benefit of consumers whocontributed towards them.COPY NO. f    fCABINETMoreover,  Local Authorities have stressed that:-(i)    o.o compensation is being offered them frr the lossof contributions made in the past to the ratesby their electricity undertaking?(ii)    they will lose the benefit of &quot;income tax set-off&quot;?(iii)    the severance of the electricity undertaking fromthe remainder of the Local Authority organisation will reduce the field over which establishment and other overhead expenses can be spread?    and(iv)    the equilibrium of their Superannuation Funds willbe disturbed,3* No departure from the basic (net debt) principlegoverning the transfer of electricity undertakings from one form of public ownership to another can,  of course, becontemplated.      Nevertheless,  the terms of transfer shouldbe such that while Local Authorities cannot expect to gain by the transfer,  they equally ought not to be forced toexperience appreciable losses.      I am accordingly not a
little disturbed &quot;by the persistence with which LocalAuthorities have urged the extent to which they will,   infact,  lose financially on the transaction and I am sure that strong pressure will he exerted with a view to obtainingsome concession during the Committee Stage of the Bill.Indeed the remarks of the Chancellor of the Exchequer duringthe Second Reading Debate on the Transport Bill (official report of 17th December,   1946 - column 1823),  have given theimpression in municipal circles that in this respect the door is not finally closed,4. The extent of such losses depends on severalfactors such as the general policy of the authority in regardto their trading undertakings and the size of those under-takings and these factors are briefly examined below:-(a) Contributions to General Rate Fund.      All authorities may take contributions under certain conditions - a sufficientrevenue surplus,  a reserve fund of at least 5% of total capital expenditure,  a maximum contribution of 1%% of netoutstanding debt.      Some authorities take such contributionsregularly as a matter cf policy,  others occasionally as amatter of expediency, many never take them.      If all theconditions were favourable and every authority exercised itsrights the maximum sum transferrable at present would beabout  27:m.  per annum.      Sums actually transferred in pre-war years totalled some  600,000 per annum.(b) Income Tax &quot;Set Off&quot;.      The benefits vary accordingto the taxable profits  of the undertakings - which in turndepend to a considerable extent upon the policy of theauthority (e.g.  whether directed to &quot;reasonable1  profits,or to lowest possible tariffs to consumers) - to the loaninterest from which tax is deducted and to the rate- of taxcurrent.      Figures of total Income Tax set off are notavailable, but the total tax payable on the profits of theelectricity undertakings which sets a maximum to the set offis in the region of  2im.  per annum.(c)    Contributions to Central Establishment Charges.Naturally these depend upon the size of the undertaking, butthey also vary according to the degree of centralisation inthe authority&apos;s organisation.      Little data is available, butthe few figures known show contributions,  in terms of penceper unit sold, varying from . 003d.   at Sheffield to .018d.  atLeyton.      If an average of , 005d.   is assumed the total loss to local authorities would be about  400,000 per annum.In these circumstances it is clear that&quot;anyaccurate assessment of the loss suffered by Local Authorities   (is not possible without much research,  and that compensationon a basis of an exact assessment would not be fair to allAuthorities.      The maximum possible loss may be of the orderof  5.5m.  a year while the actual loss may be possibly much less, say  2.5m.  a year.5. Having- regard to these considerations I have come tothe conclusion that a scheme of global compensation is theonly practical solution,  especially bearing in mind that(i)  it is essential to ensure that those Local Authorities who in the past have not favoured the ratepayer at the expenseof the consumer or those whose&apos; more prudent financial policy will benefit the new Boards,  do not suffer in comparison with
those who have adopted well-established practices whichhave had. behind them the sanction of the existing law;(ii) that it is undesirable to attempt to meet any-particular type of loss by additional compensation;(iii) that arrangements which would remove all anomaliesand inequalities are not possible.Accordingly;,  I &quot;propose that I shall be authorisedto allocate a global sum of say  5m.  by way of additional compensastion to all Local Authorities;,  a sum which couldbe divided among them according to the size of theirelectricity undertakings.Compensation of this nature might be paid in stock and a reasonable basis of allocation, might beaccording to the units of electricity sold say in theyear 1946.      Assuming these to total 20,OOOrn,  for all local Authorities,  the global sum of  5m.  would be equalto .066.  per unit and would be expressed as payable onthat basis.It is appreciated that a scheme on these lineswill not secure an exact measure    of compensation&apos;to individual authorities,  those whose policy has been consistently to aid the ratepayer at the expense cf theconsumer faring less well than those whose policy hasbeer, to wplough back&quot; all profits  into the electricityundertaking, but on the whole rough justice may beachieved.      It wo uld for example enable authorities onthe average to taper off losses on the basis of 1st year100$,  Snd year 662/3%,   3rd year 33-16. This matter has been given preliminary consideration by the Committee  on the Socialisation ofIndustries at their meeting on 25th February,  1947(S.I.(M)(47) 1st Meeting,  Minute S) when I was invitedto bring it before the Cabinet for decision.       I now seek the concurrence of my colleagues to introducing aGovernment amendment to the Electricity Bill at anE. S.Ministry of Fuel and Power,7, Millbank,  S.W. 1,1st March,   1947.
