13 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (47)  60 COPY NO.   2013TH FEBRUARY,  1947CABINETUNEMPLCYMENT BEHEFIT :_THREE-DAY WAITING PERIODMemorandum by the Minister of National Insurance1.-     The Prime Minister has received a letter from the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress representing thatworkers who are thrown out of employment as a result of the fuel cuts should not have to wait three days before receiving umemployment benefit.2.      Under the existing law no payment of benefit is made forthe first three days of unemployment.    The New Insurance Schemecontains a rather different provision:    initially, no payment will he made for the first three days of unemployment, but ifthe period of unemployment lasts for as long as twelve dayspayment is then made for the first three days.    This provision in the new scheme (which is to apply also to sickness andindustrial injury benefit) was arrived at after a good, deal ofParliamentary discussion and in the face of demands, which had.to be resisted, that the waiting period should be abolishedaltogether.    It is clear, therefore, that if any change is tobe made now in. the existing scheme it should, not go beyond, theprovision in the new scheme;    that is to say, the waiting period should not be abolished altogether and the utmost we should consider is the making of back payment for the waiting periodif unemployment lasts for twelve days or more.3.      I am disposed to think that if such a change could bemade immediately without legislation so as to apply to thosethrown out of work since 10th February it would be definitely to the public advantage to make it, andparticularly if it could be announced before the week-end.One point which has been urged against the proposal is thatit may in some cases tend to delay the&apos;return to workwhen the crisis is over.    For instance, a man who has beenout for eleven days and returns on the twelfth would losethree days&apos; benefit (which in the case of a married man with one child or more would be 22s.6d.) as against a day&apos;s pay.There is also the point that the change would have no effectunless unemployment lasts for twelve days and might thereforebe taken as an indication of the Government&apos;s view thatthe crisis will last at least a fortnight.    I do not,however, think that these arguments outweigh the considerations on the other side.
644,      The change,  if made, would unfortunately add still more to the very heavy burden which the Ministry of Labour have to c-carry in administering unemployment benefit but the Ministerof Labour informs me that this can be faced if necessary.5.     For (say) two million unemployed for not less than twelve days the cost of the concession would be about l:g million, which would be borne by the Unemployment Fund,6.      The Law Officers consider that  it would be possibleto make the suggested regulation with retrospective effect,so as to enable payment to be made in respect of waiting dayswhich occurred between. 9th February and the date of theregulationo7.     As I have ind.ica.ted I think that if the change is made it ought to be announced before the week-end. and that muchof its advantage would be lost if this is not done.    Theappropriate way of announcing it would be a statement in theHouse of Commons tomorrow.    I attach a draft.J. G.Ministry of National Insurance13TH FEBRUARY,  1947.
65ANNEXDRAFT ON PROPOSED STATEMENT IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONSWith your permission, Mr. Speaker,  and that of theHouse, I should like to make a statement on a matter which has been giving some concern, namely, the effectof the waiting days requirements of the present UnemploymentInsurance Acts on the large numbers of persons who are having to claim unemployment benefit during the present emergency.      I have decided to use powers given to me inthe National Insurance Act,  1946,  to anticipate theoperation of the waiting day provisions of that Act.    Ipropose, therefore,  to make regulations forthwith to bringthe present Unemployment Insurance scheme into line withthe new Act in this respect.    The effect will be thatany waiting days served on or after Monday, 10th February, 1947will rank for payment of benefit in cases where the claimantis unemployed for twelve days or more in accordance withthe current continuity rules but provided that, as is laiddown in the new Act,  these days occur within a period of13 weeks.
