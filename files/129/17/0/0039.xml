COPY NO.J2.__C.P*(UP 89iUTH MARCH. 19U7.CABINETIMPRISONMENT (GERMAN AND AUSTRIAN)  SENTENCES bill memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster -I ask for the approval of the Cabinet to introduce inParliament a Bivl which would make possible the custody in orisonsin Great Britain of British subjects sentenced to imprisonment orpenal servitude by Control Commission Courts in the British zone of Germany and British Sector of Berlin and by Military GovernmentCourts in the British Zone of Austria and British district of vienna.2. The necessity for this Bill arises from the fact that suchtransfers are impossible under the law as it stands at present.In consequence,  British subjects sentenced by our courts in Germanyand Austria have to serve their sentences in a German prison.They are confined in a special wing for United Nations nationals in the prison at Werl in the British Zone of Germany which is administered by a British Governor;    there is also a small Britishsupervisory staff and the material arrangements are the best possible in the circumstances.      Nevertheless,  conditions in aGerman prison cannot fail to be harsher than in prisons in thiscountry,  because of the generally difficult supply situation,  and because of the virtual impossibility of visits .from friends andrelatives.      Moreover,  it is necessary to use German warders as other suitable staff is not available.      It has not been possibleto make similar arrangements in the British Zone of Austria andBritish subjects sentenced there are transferred to Werl.3* The incarceration of British subjects in a German  prisonhas been criticised in parliament and I have indicated in theHouse of Commons my sympathy with their view that British subjectsshould if possible serve their sentences of imprisonment in thiscountry.      It is of course to be hoped that the number- of British .subjects who will be sentenced to terms of imprisonment by ourcourts will not be high;    nevertheless,  cases are bound to occurfairly regularly so long as we keep a Control Commission Ofappreciable size in Germany,  and indeed the numbers may grow as more business men and other visitors are allowed to travel in theBritish Zone.      The Bill should therefore be useful for a numberof years.h- The question of bringing British subjects to thiscountry has been explored with the Home Office,  who have indicated that while they are reluctant  to make any additions,  however small,to the number of prisoners in H.M.  prisons,  they would be preparedto accept the British subjects and British-protected personssentenced in Germany and Austria.      A draft Bill has therefore been prepared,  considered by the different Departments concerned,and is now being put into final form by Parliamentary Counsel.It will be a short Bill of some three clauses and the following are its main points:-
(i)    Its effect is confined to persons sentenced by-Control Commission Courts in Germany and by military Government Courts  in Austria;    Britishsubjects cannot at present he tried by German orAustrian Courts but when this becomes possiblethere would be no question cf sentences imposed bythern being served in this country.      Although theLaw Officers have taken the view that control commission Courts are technically &quot;foreign&quot; courtsI think it will be agreed that they possesssufficiently the character of British courts (onwhich their processes are closely modelled) fortheir sentences to be accepted as adequatejustification for detention in this country.(ii)    The Bill is permissive.      Persons will betransferred to a prison in this country only with the consent of the Home Secretary, whichwill be given either to classes- of case or tothe individual cases as appropriate.      I hopethat the Home Secretary will normally give his consent,  except possibly in the case of very short sentences.(iii)    It provides that a person transferred to a prisonin this country will be treated under theregulations relating to sentences of imprisonmentas if his sentence had been imposed by a Courtiii this country.(iv)    It provides that the Home Secretary may direct that a juvenile&apos; offender under 17 years of agemay be sent to an Approved School in this country,rather than serve a term of imprisonment.Consideration is also being given to thepossibility of providing under the Bill for thetransfer of young offenders to a Borstalinstitution rather than to a prison,  where thisia appropriate.5. During a preliminary discussion on the subject inthe Legislation Committee cn February 16th (H.P.C.(47) 8thMeeting, Minute l)  the suggestion was made that the Billshould also contain a clause to provide for the recognitionof Control Commission Courts in Germany and military government Courts in Austria as valid tribunals havingjurisdiction over British subjects.      The value of such a clause would be that it would prevent any person fromdisputing the legality of the sentences passed by these courtThis suggestion has been carefully considered in conjunctionwith Parliamentary Counsel, but it is thought that it wouldbe undesirable to adopt it for the following reasons:-,(a) Legislation to A^alidate one detail of our administration in Germany would throw doubt on the rest of our actions there? including those sentences imposed on British subjectspassed before the Bill became law.(b) The inclusion of such a validating clause wouldbe likely to provoke discussion in parliament on the complex legal questions surrounding our occupation in Germany, which might occupyconsiderable Parliamentarsr time and so delay the passage of the Bill,
I suggest that it would, therefore he preferable to leave the express validation of our judicial as of our other acts inGermany&quot; to he covered retrospectively,  if necessary, by an-Act of Indemnity in due course.      For practical purposes,I consider that the draft Bill, which gives express sanction to the holding of a prisoner from the moment when, withthe consent of the Home Secretary,  the Commander-in-Ghiefin Germany certifies that he should he brought to serve hissentence  in this country,   is sufficient.I ask. the approval of the Cabinet to the policy outlined above.      If this is given, the draft Bill will he&quot;brought before the Legislation Committee for examination&quot;Kefore introduction in Parliament.J. B. H.Control Office for Germanyand Austria,    S.W. 1.14th March,  1947.
