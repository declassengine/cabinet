THIS DOCUMENT   1$ THE  PROPERTY  OF   HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJ STY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1947SECRET ; Copy No.    2CP. (47) 9820th March, 1947NEWFOUNDLANDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs. My colleagues will remember that, at a meeting held on Tuesday,27th November, 1945 (CM. (45) 56th Conclusions), the Cabinet approved proposals in my Cabinet memoranda OP. (45) 234 and 292 for enabling the people of new foundland to choose their future form of Government. In brief, the proposal was that there should be established in Newfoundland an elected NationalConvention of Newfoundlanders to review all the alternative courses open to the island and to make recommendations to the United Kingdom Government as abasis for a national referendum on the various forms of constitution which mightbe adopted. The referendum would be the instrument for enabling the Newfound-land people to vote for the form of constitution which they prefer.2. The National Convention was duly elected and began its deliberations inthe autumn of 1946. At the outset, and after some general discussion, it set upCommittees to enquire into every phase of the economic and financial position ofthe Island. These Committees are now reporting, and their reports are being-discussed by the Convention.3. Until recently, there was no direct discussion of the constitutional issue as such, and the Convention has regarded its investigation of the financial andeconomic position as its first task. In order to obtain assistance in this, theConvention has now adopted two Resolutions as to obtaining guidance from theUnited Kingdom Government and the Canadian Government respectively withregard to the financial implications in the future of (a) association with theUnited Kingdom through the retention of Commission of Government in itspresent or in a modified form, (b) the restoration of self-government to Newfound-land and (c) confederation with Canada.4., The two Resolutions sought the agreement of the United Kingdom and canadian Governments respectively to receiving ismall deputations from theConvention who could put questions and receive answers, the delegation to theUnited Kingdom to precede that to Canada. Each delegation would consist ofthe Chairman of the Convention and six members.5. I have said that we should be glad to receive the proposed delegation tothis country and have suggested as a convenient date Tuesday, 29th April, and thefollowing days. I understand that the Canadian Government are likely to agreesimilarly to receive the delegation proposed for Ottawa.6. The subjects on which the delegation wish to put questions to the UnitedKingdom Government are, I understand, as follows : (1) The Public Debt.(2) Interest-free loans.(3) Development loans.(4) The position arising out of the establishment of United States bases in newfoundland.(5) The financing and control of Newfoundland airports.(6) Trade and tariffs.(7) Any other matters.[33339]
7. These subjects are, as will be seen, in very general terms and I have asked that the precise questions which the delegation propose to put under these headsshould be formulated and forwarded to me at the earliest possible date in orderto allow time for them to be fully considered here before the meetings with the delegations take place. I have also asked that the questions should be supported* jl by explanatory memoranda. As soon as the questions are received I suggest that[I  they should be considered inter-departmentally in the first place.8. My colleagues will no doubt wish to be informed of the present positionand I will keep them informed of developments, since it may be anticipated that itwill become necessary for me to consult the Cabinet later on some of the items tobe raised.A.Dominions Office,20th March, 1S47.
