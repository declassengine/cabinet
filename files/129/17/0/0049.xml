HIS  DOCUMENT   IS  THE   PROPERTY  OF   HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 19472SECRET Copy No. . *21st March, 1947CABINETFOOD SUPPLIES FOR THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Minister of food submit to my colleagues that it is urgently necessary, for both psychologicaland physiological reasons, to make any improvements which prove possible inthe present diet of the British people. The only improvement which it is possibleto make at the present moment is to increase the sugar ration from 8 to 10 ozs.a week as from 27th April. In order to do so on that date an announcement would have to be made at least one month beforehand, by (say) Thursday,27th March. The case for making this increase in the ration appears to meto be as follows.2. Physiological position attach as an annex &quot; A Report on the Nutrition of the British People inMarch 1947,&quot; submitted to me by Dr. Magnus Pyke of my Scientific Adviser&apos;sDivision. In order that my colleagues may have the report without delay I am circulating it immediately. The comments of the Nutritional Advisers of theMinister of Health, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofEducation will be circulated as soon as possible. I would call my colleagues&apos;attention to paragraphs 8-12 and in particular to the table at the top of page 6,to paragraph 15 together with table 3 on page 7, and to paragraphs 24 and 25with table 4 on page 8. I have sidelined these paragraphs. They show thefirst disturbing signs of a. reversal of trend in the excellent health and nutritionalstatistics which have, up to the present, resulted from our general nutritionalpolicy.The proposed increase in the sugar ration, with a small increase to manu-facturers, would provide the population with some 40 extra calories a day, justabout restoring the recent reductions in their diet. Sugar is, of course, one ofthe best calorie-providing foods.3. Psychological position need not, I am sure, labour to my colleagues the immense psychological andpolitical importance of giving the British people some relief at the presentmoment. I suggest that the ability to provide a few stimuli of this sort maymake ail the difference between success and failure in our production drive. Itis surely no good keeping our people on so low a diet that they will have neitherthe will nor the strength to produce the goods which can alone earn us the dollars to buy further supplies of food.Dollar Aspects4-. The entire quantity of sugar from dollar areas necessary to make this increaseddistribution, and to maintain it through 1948, has already been purchased or hasbeen authorised for purchase by the Treasury. Thus the increase in the ration willnot cost us an extra dollar. It is true, of course, that if we buy this sugar and do not distribute it, thus increasing our stocks, we make still more sure that weshall have to spend no dollars on sugar in 1949. But we are already rapidlyfreeing ourselves from the need to buy &quot;dollar &quot; sugar. We have had to askfor Treasury authorisation (which has been given) to incur a net liability for[33352] b
only 400,000 tons of &quot; dollar &quot; snga.r for 1948 (in order, I repeat, to make thepresent increase in the ration and to maintain it through 1948), as against apurchase of 750,000 tons net of &apos;&apos; dollar &apos;&apos; 1947.   Sir William Rook,my Director of Sugar, and I would say the greatest sugar expert in the world,is confident that by 1949 we shall not need to buy any &quot; dollar &quot; sugar at all. Butit would, of course, be wrong to suggest that anyone can guarantee this absolutelytwo years ahead. We are, in any case, rapidly freeing ourselves from dependence on    dollar&quot; sugar. &apos;.&apos; (V;5. Internal Financial Aspect &apos; &quot;   &apos;The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked that the extra distribution of sugar should not increase the net Food Subsidy Bill (it would do so by  8 million,if not offset). This stipulation of the Cha,ncellor&apos;s can be met. In fact it seems clear that the price increases which we are in course of making in a number of foodstuffs will provide the extra  8 million needed.6. Conclusion : t. :*      \.;.KHI am well aware of the intensely difficult dollar position which faces theChancellor. My Ministry is making its utmost, efforts to free ourselves from dollar sources of supply, and is having some success in this, as is shown by theabove particulars relating to sugar. Again, I made.it.a.principal objective ofpolicy of my visit to Canada and to the United States to secure feeding.stuffs, inorder to free ourselves as rapidly as humanly possible from the terribly, expensiveimportation of eggs, bacon and other very highly priced foodstuffs. But surelyit would be an impossible position if, for the sake of a potential saving in dollarstwo years hence, we denied to the sorely tried British people to-day the one relief which we can give them on the food front. I believe that to do so would be quiteindefensible so long as we refrain from cutting down, if need be. drastically, our dollar imports of films and tobacco. Surely the provision of a diet adequate tothe people&apos;s basic bodily needs must take priority over films and&quot;-tobacco.7. Position of Other RationsFinally, I must warn my colleagues that it is by no means certain that, weshall be able to maintain all our other rations. The Minister of Agriculture may,I understand, have grave news for us as a result of agricultural losses due to the weather this year, which may affect our rations in the second half - of the year.Again, as I have already warned my colleagues, it is only too possible that wemay have to cut the tea ration, although I am doing my utmost to avoid this. Itis therefore surely all the more essential to give the one increase in a basic rationwhich is at present possible. :- J. S.Ministry of Food, S.W&apos;. 1, .  -    -21st March, 1947. j - &apos;:
annex report -ON THE NUTRITION OF THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN IN.. . MARCH, 1947Summary1. During the war years the Ministry of Food adopted a nutrition policydesigned to distribute food on the basis of its nutritional value so that vulnerablegroups, such as expectant and nursing mothers, infants and children, should havea diet suited to their physiological needs and the rest of the population be ableto obtain enough for nutritional well-being and efficiency.   (Paragraphs 2, 3.)2. To the effectiveness of. this policy can be attributed the remarkable fallin maternal mortality, in the stillbirth rate and in neonatal and infant mortality.The death rate from respiratory tuberculosis, when based on comparable popula-tion statistics, decreased during the war years and showed thereby that the dietarylevel of the nation was, to say the least, nutritionally adequate. The incidence of anaemia, a disease directly attributed to diet, also, showed evidence ofdiminution.   (Paragraphs 4, 5.)3. Schoolchildren were in 1945 heavier and taller than their predecessorsof the same age had been pre-war.   (Paragraph 5.)4. During the post-war years, the national diet became in some respectsmore restricted. Although its nutritional composition remained satisfactory, thecalories provided by the diets consumed in working-class households, which in1944 had supplied 100 per cent, of the physiological requirements, in 1945provided only 98 per cent, and in the first three-quarters of 1946 only 96 per cent,of the physiological needs of the people eating them. The latest available figure for the third quarter of 1946 was 93 per cent.   (Paragraphs 8-12.)5. Although the cost of working-class food purchases had showed a tendency to increase during the war years, no marked rise has been visible during 1945and 1946. At the same time the total earnings of manual workers have increased from 178 per cent, of the 1938 base-line in 1945 to 181 per-, cent^in 1946.(Paragraphs 13, 14.) )6. The most important post-war change in food control was the rationing of bread. Although the scheme for bread rationing was based on physiologicalneed, the domestic ration was designed to be supplemented by bread provided as a part of canteen meals and snacks. If nevertheless, the domestic ration aloneplus an assessment of the average working class consumption of unrationedfoods are compared with requirements, the nutritional needs of young children,are more than met, women and girls obtain their requirements as do school-children, provided they obtain school meals, and manual workers if they havea canteen or restaurant meal. Sedentary men, that is, say, clerks or the agedwho may not be able to eat outside their homes do not get enough. Finally,adolescent boys, on the assumptions of this calculation, obtain substantially lessthan their needs.   (Paragraphs 15-18 )7. Public health statistics are not easy to collect quickly. There is alreadyevidence, however, in the unpublished statistics of the authorities in Glasgowand in Liverpool that the wartime increase in the weight of school-children has suffered a check and at certain ages children were lighter in 1946 than in 1945.(Paragraphs 25-26.)8. The most significant evidence of the possible influence of restricted dietis derived from the Ministry&apos;s body-weight survej&quot;. This shows that whereas in 1943-44 and i.944-45 adolescents of both sexes between the ages of 17 and 21years increased in weight between one July and the next, between 1945 and1946 the expected increase in the weight of the boys of 19-21 was reduced whilegirls of 18, 19, 20 and 21 years of age lost weight. These adolescents were employed in small industrial and commercial firms not provided with canteens.As such they comprised a group likely first to feel a tightening of the screw.Their reduction of weight increase, while not perhaps serious of itself, may therefore constitute a. warning.[33352] b 2
REPORT  ON  THE  NUTRITION  OF   THE  PEOPLE  OF  BRITAINMARCH 19471. Almost two years have now elapsed since the end of World War II.During that period the effective food supplies of the country have dwindled. Itis, therefore, important to review such evidence of the present nutritional stateof the population as is available. This scrutiny is doubly important in viewof the fact that the extent of the very real progress achieved during the war isonly now becoming generally apparent, and it would be easy to forget that war-time conditions were in many respects different from those prevailing in 1947.I, The Nutritional Level achieved during the War2. During the last seven years the nutrition policy of the Ministry ofFood has been to do everything possible to maintain the total of food supplies at a level sufficient to provide the needs of the population, and at the same timeto control distribution in such a way that the specific nutritional requirementsof the separate categories of the population shall be met. This policy has beencarried out by means of the following measures :  (a) Rationing animal protein foods such as meat, bacon and cheese on an equal basis.(b) Rationing fat on an equal basis.(c) Rationing sugar and sweets on an equal basis.(d) Rendering butter and margarine nutritionally interchangeable by addingvitamins A and D to the latter.(e) Promoting the production and consumption of vegetables rich in vitaminsA and C.(/) Overcoming the pre-war dietary deficiency of vitamin Bl by the intro-duction of flour and bread of a more nutritious character which alsoimproves the iron content of the diet.(g) Improving supplies of calcium by the distribution of milk according tophysiological need; the increased consumption of &quot; milk solids,&quot; e.g.,cheese, dried skimmed milk, &amp;e.; and the addition of calcium carbonateto flour.(h) Leaving unrationed as long as possible an &quot; energy buffer &quot; of potatoes,bread and flour.(i) Making provision for supplying unrationed m,eals for workers &apos;&apos; on the job &quot; as an alternative to a rigid scheme of differential rations.(j) Providing school meals designed to meet the nutritional need of childrenbetween 5 and 14 years of age.3. In addition to these measures, a number of special steps have been takento protect the nutritional position of &quot;vulnerable groups&quot; such as expectantand nursing mothers, infants and children. These regulations have dealt with thefollowing foods : (a) Milk priority supplies for children and for expectant and nursing mothers; a special issue to children at school; and a milk-cocoa drinkfor adolescents.(b) Eggs a priority supply of eggs made available to children from 6 months to 2 years of age.(c) Cod Liver Oil an issue made to expectant mothers and children up to5 years of age. Mothers may obtain vitamin A and D tablets in placeof oil.(d) Concentrated orange juice a standardised preparation provided forexpectant mothers and children up to 5. Fresh oranges have also beenprovided from time to time.4. The effectiveness of these plans for a logical food policy was faciliated by the high wages and full employment of the war years. In addition, the pricesof all basic food, and few others were available, were held down to a level well within reach of almost every class of the population.5. The success of this gigantic and imaginative experiment in applied nutri-tion can now be seen at every point where public health statistics can be broughtto bear : (i) Maternal mortality. In. the 4 pre-war years 1938-39 the maternalmortality rate in England and Wales fell from 3-19 to 2-55 per 1,000births (20 per cent.).&quot; In the 4 years 1941-44 the fall was from 2-25to 1-52 (32 per cent.).
ft ft A641(ii) Stillbirth rate-The, figures between 1936 and 1939 fell from 40 to 38per 1,000 total births (5 per cent, reduction). Between 1941 and 1944the fall was from 35 to 28 (20 per cent.).(iii) Neonatal mortality. In 1936, 30 out of each 1,000 babies in Englandand Wales died within a nionth. In 1939 the rate had fallen to 28, a drop of 7 per cent. The corresponding reduction for the 4 years1941-44 was from 29 to 24, or 17 per cent.(iv) Infant mortality. Between 1921-30 and 1931-35 the average infantmortality dropped from 72 to 62 per 1,000 live births, a fall of 14 percent. Between 1936 and 1939 the rate fell from 59 to 51 (14 per cent.).For the 5 war years 1940-44 the reduction was from 57 to 45 (21 percent.). 1 .(v) Death rate from respiratory tuberculosis.&apos; When comparable popula-tion are taken and adjustment made for deaths arising in the Services,the mean annual rate for males for the years 1931-35 of 768 permillion can be compared with 638 in 1939 and 588 in 1945. The corres-ponding rates for females are 543 in 1931-35, 410 in 1939 and 359 in1945.(vi) Ancemia. In 1943, the Medical Research Council carried out a survey of about 16,000 people of both sexes and of different ages and occupa-tions throughout the country. It was concluded that the pre-war position had been well maintained and that there was less anaemiathan before the war, particularly in women and children. this improvement was almost certainly due to better diet.(vii) Growth of school children. In 1945, boys of 5 years old in Glasgowwere 2-2 lbs. heavier and 1-1 inches taller than their predecessors ofthe same age had been in 1930. The corresponding increases in thegrowth of girls were 2 - 2 lbs. and 0 - 9 inches. Similarly the 13-year-oldGlasgow boys were 6 - 8 lbs. heavier and 1 - 8 inches taller and thegirls 8-8 lbs. heavier and 1-7 inches taller in 1.945 than those of thesame age in 1930. Altogether, in 21 areas studied in 1944 the averageweights of boys were greater in 19 and of girls in 20 districts thanpre-war.6. All these figures are doubly remarkable when they are recognised as applying to the war years. It is true that although the national nutrition policycertainly contributed to the striking achievements which they represent, it cannotbe proved that better diet was in each case solely responsible, nor can the propor-tion of the progress achieved justly attributable to nutrition be preciselymeasured. Nevertheless, quite apart from those benefits derived from improvedstandards of living due to high war-time wages or from advances in therapeuticsand the use of new drugs, Ebbs, Tisdall and Scott (1941) in Toronto showed inan investigation of 400 women that improved nutrition reduced the number ofstillbirths and the morbidity and mortality of the infants, besides diminishingthe incidence of complications and improving the health of the mother. That isto say, nutrition was demonstrated to be capable of influencing maternal mortality,stillbirth rate and infant and neonatal mortality.7. Respiratory tuberculosis is due to an infection, nevertheless it is wellknown that defective nutrition increases the body&apos;s susceptibility to the disease and Leitch (1945) has recently reviewed the evidence showing that diet plays adominant part in maintaining resistance against tuberculosis. Overcrowdedconditions, shelter life and lack of facilities for segregating infective patientsincreased the danger of the disease spreading. The figures given above, therefore,with their careful adjustment to allow for changes in the composition of thepopulation (Stocks 1947), give substantial weight to the belief that a diet ofnutritional adequacy was generally available throughout the war years.II. Changes in the Food Supply During the Post-War. Months8. Between April 1945 and April 1947, a number of changes occurred in domestic rations and allowances. The bacon ration fell from 4 to 2 oz. weekly;cooking fat was reduced from 2 to 1 oz.; and dried eggs disappeared from the ration and were &quot; put on points.&quot; In exchange, an extra 2 oz. cf corned beefwas available in 1947 and an extra half ounce of tea. Fish and fruit, bothunrationed, were also substantially more plentiful.9.   Many of the changes in the &quot; points &quot; rationing scheme bore hardly onthe housewife.   Although protein foods, such as canned salmon or sausage, were as readily available in 1947 as they had been in 1945, the increased &quot;points &quot;[33352] b 3
cost of biscuits, breakfast cereals and skimmed milk and dried eggs, the last twoof which had earlier been free of &quot; points,&quot; tended to make housekeeping moredifficult.10. The most significant change, however, was the rationing of bread whichwas introduced for the first time in British history in July 1946.11. The nutritional value of the average working-class diet, as assessed bythe Ministry&apos;s national food survey, provided in April 1945 the full nutritionalrequirements of the families studied. The last available figures from this survey for October 1946, on the other hand, showed that the calorific value of the foodconsumed in the home had fallen to 94 per cent, of the average requirement. the composition of this diet was adequate, but the total amount was thus 6 per cent,less than the average nutritional need. The dwindling consumption of the post-war months is shown in Table 1.Table l.-Proportion of the average calorie requirements of working-classhouseholds provided by food consumed in the home1944-1st quarter 2nd quarter      ......3rd quarter 4th quarter1945-1st quarter 2nd quarter3rd quarter 4th quarter1946-1st quarter 2nd quarter3rd quarter** Figures for August and September only.Per cent.9810110010110299979699......        96......        93The October figure was 94%.Although the calorie figures only apply to food consumed in the home, theestimates of requirements with which they are compared have been adjusted toallow for food eaten outside the household.12. An apparent food consumption less than that needed for physiologicalefficiency is a disquieting observation, and the figures above give greater cause for uneasiness when it is remembered that they are based on an average ofapproximately 600 urban working-class homes. In 1937, Sir John Orr reported on his classical study which was carried out by a similar technique on 1,152families. Orr concluded that from one-third to a half of the population were, atthat time, malnourished. Although the quality of his diets was very much less satisfactory than that found by the Ministry&apos;s present surveys, it can be seen from the figures given below that the calorie consumption of all but the lowestof his social groups was higher in 1937 than that of working-class families to-daywho might have been expected to be equivalent to, say, his social categories and III. There is, therefore, reason to fear that within the average of thepresent working-class group there are sections whose intake of calories is sub-stantially lower even than the 93 per cent, of their needs available to them inthe third quarter of 1946.Table 2.

9 F ^hi &apos;di w13. The cost of the diet per head per week purchased by the families studied in the Ministry&apos;s survey has shown a tendency to rise. The figure for January1944, for example, was 9/8 which compares with 10/7 in January 1945 and inJanuary 1946. There is, however, a marked fluctuation in different months, andwhereas the cost in the first three months of 1946 was 10/7, 10/5 and 10/10 per head per week, the corresponding figures for the months of the second quarterof the year were 11/7, 13/5 and 11/6.14. The power to purchase, however, appears to have been well maintained,and whereas in January and July 1945, the average weekly earnings of manual workers were 94s. and 965., or 76 per cent, and 80 per cent, higher than in 1938,in the corresponding months of 1946 average earnings were 93s. and 101s, weekly,that is 74 per cent, and 89 per cent, above the 1938 base line.  (Bowley, 1946, 1947.)15. Although with the control or bread and flour all the principal foods!were brought within the rationing scheme, a number of items, of which potatoes jand fish are examples, still remain outside. In addition, the purchase of meals and snacks can be used as a method of supplementing the diet. It is, nevertheless,interesting to observe to what extent the nutritional value of the rations, includingmilk, plus the average amounts of unrationed foods and &apos;&apos; Points &apos;&apos; eaten per head per day in working-class households (National Food Survey, September 1946)cover the requirements of different categories of individuals. Figures for caloriesare shown in Table 3.Table 3. Caloric value of rationed and unrationed foodsChild of 4 years oldSchoolboy of 11 ...Sedentary womanAdolescent girl ...Expectant motherManual worker femaleManual worker male ..Sedentary man ...Adolescent boy  ...Eation.1,3491,5341,4831.7711,9941,6271,9151,4831,771Rationsplus other food.Proportion ofrequirementin rationsRequirement,   plus other.Per cent.8542.0391.9882,2762.1322.4201.9882.2761,60025,002,1002,4002,5002,5003,0002.5003,8001168295951028581796016. It can be seen from Table 3 that young children receive more thanenough for their needs if the family supplies of unrationed foods are dividedequally. Expectant mothers, sedentary women and adolescent girls can obtainamounts closely proportioned to their needs. If the schoolboy receives his school milk (102 calories) and a school meal providing, say, 600 calories, his require-ments will also be amply met. If, however, he is a member of the 56 per cent, ofthe school population who cannot obtain a meal at school, his nutritional needsmust be made up out of a family pool derived perhaps from younger brothers orsisters.17.The bread rationing scheme was designed to use industrial canteensas the michinery for the distribution of part of the calorie supplement needed for the performance of muscular work. The figures above show that manual workers must depend on a bought meal of 600-800 calories if they are to obtain their nutritional requirements. Provision is made for the heaviest workers toreceive increased bread and flour as part of the allocation to &quot; Category A&quot;canteens.18. Table 3 suggests that the sedentary man, for example, the clerk takingsandwiches to work and, in particular, the adolescent boy receive substantially less than their needs from home supplies of food.19. The Calorific values discussed in the foregoing paragraphs are thosetheoretically available to different categories of consumers. To what extent theseamounts are actually consumed and to what extent the total composition of the diet provides the nutritional requirements of the different types of consumers isnot known. Although it is known that the energy value of average working-classdiet fell short of requirements by 6 per cent, while the supply of nutrients was substantially adequate, information about separate groups of people in different parts of the country, in different circumstances and of diverse physiologicalcategories has up till the present not been available. Several limited investiga-tions have, however, been made from which suggestive information can be derived.
. ;,3Qt In July 1946,: a restricted study of the diets of laundry workers inLondon and Manchester was carried out by the Scientific Adviser&apos;s Division.This study did not pretend to include statistically significant numbers. It was,however, designed to obtain a sample of the individual diets which were being-eaten, at the time. The result of this investigation showed that although theaverage, consumption of a group of adolescent girls studied was reasonably satis-factory, one-third of their numbers obtained insufficient protein. Similar figures were obtained for other nutrients. Among the adult women working in thelaundries approximately 10 per cent, obtained insufficient calories, that is to say,they had too little to eat, and more than 20 per cent, consumed insufficientvitamin A.21. A similar study carried out in December 1946 suggested that a propor-tion of the adolescents attending a London youth club were eating less proteinthan the amount needed for full health.22. Too few of these investigations have so far been completed for it to bepossible to produce precise figures and there is too little information availablefor previous years for it to be possible to determine whether there is a trend forthe better or the worse. Obviously, however, work of this nature is extremely important and further investigations are being undertaken within the limits ofthe restricted dietetic staff available.III. Evidence of the Effect on the National Nutrition of thePost-War Diet23. During the last few months the difficulties and hardships of life in thiscountry have increased and in many quarters the impression has been growingthat the nutrition of the country is deteriorating. Although much of this corn-plaint has almost certainly been unfounded, it is important to scrutinise closelyall the current available information. A significant finding frequentlyencountered in the underfed countries of Europe has been that it is difficult todetect the early effects of malnutrition on health. Only after inadequate dietshave been eaten for some considerable time can clinical evidence be detected. Itis not, therefore, to be expected that any dramatic signs will be visible of recessionfrom the excellent war-time nutritional state, if, indeed, any recession has infact occurred. For this very reason, however, the following evidence deservesattention.24. At the request of the Scientific Adviser&apos;s Division the Surveys Branchrecently abstracted from the statistics collected by their body-weight survey thefigures for adolescents shown in Table 3. It has been seen that the total nationaldiet has dwindled in amount during the months of 1946. It would be expected,therefore, that any effect on nutrition would first appear among those groupsfor whom official rations and allowances were least adequate when compared withtheir psysiological need. There are a number of reasons for anxiety about thenutrition of adolescents. The requirements of this group increase just at thatperiod when they lose their school milk and their school meals. Furthermore,during this early&quot; stage of their adult life they are most likely to have insufficientwisdom to choose for themselves the best of those foods which are available.National milk cocoa, which is specially designed to supplement the protein content of the adolescent&apos;s diet, is only taken up to the extent of 5 per cent. In Table 4are shown the increases in weight of groups of adolescents between July 1944 and july 1945 and between July 1945 and 1946. The same individuals were weighedin 1944 and 1945. The second pair of weighing refers to those weighed in 1945and reweighed in 1946. Individuals classified as aged, say, 18 in the 1945-46weighings were those whose 18th birthday fell in the year 1945.Table 4. Annual changes in iveight of adolescents working in small industrial and commercial concerns not equipped with canteens(Increase in lbs.)Boys -    GirlsAge      July 1944-45      July 1945-46 July 1944-45       July 194,5-4617 618 319 320 212 (131) 666 (64)28 (79) 134 (53) 116 (99) 1-48 (322) 0-69 (158)(50) 1-21 (386) -0-16 (249)93 (44) 0-58 (360) -0-42 (265)49 (51) 0-49 (245) -0-14 (222)1-81 (33) 0-21 (28) 0-72 (109) -0-62 (151)Note : figures in brackets are the numbers in each group.
25. These figures are profoundly disquieting. They represent the firstevidence that some of the nutritional progress achieved during the war is beginning to be lost. It appears here that 887 girls of 18-21 years of age actually suffered a loss in average weight between July 1945 and July 1946, whereas between 1943and 1944 and as shown in the table between 1944 and 1945 girls of the same ageincreased in weight, and the gain in weight of boys over 18 was less in 1945-6 thanin 1944-5.26. Although there is yet no general bulk of evidence suggesting that any marked deterioration in the national nutrition is occurring, there are one or two further scraps of information indicating that the general progress achieved duringthe war h-i&amp; suffered a check. The improvement in the growth of Glasgow school-children, between 1930 and 1945 has already been mentioned. Although laterfigures show that progress has been maintained in 1946 so far as the youngerpupils are concerned, at the older ages a slight check, has occurred. For example,the average weight of girls of 13 years old was 0-9 lbs. less in 1946 than in 1945.Boys of the same age were 0-2 lbs. lighter in 1946, a trifling loss perhaps. in liverpool, however. 12-year old schoolboys were 1-4 lbs. lighter in 1946 than inthe previous year and. although the girls of 12 years maintained the progress ofthe war years and recorded an average weight for 1946 exceeding that for 1945by 0-6 lbs., the 5-year-old girls weighed 1-1 lbs. less in 1946 than in 1945.27. There have been no radical changes in the national diet during the twopost-war years. The war-time measures designed to ensure an adequate balanceof nutrients have been maintained. The number of school meals has-in factsteadily increased and the provision of milk at school, recently rendered free of charge, now covers 95 per cent, of all pupils. In spite of these measures of controlled distribution through which nutrition policy is executed, the nationalfood supply statistics show that total food imports and production represented2,890 calories per head per day in 1946, which, though no lower than the figuresfor 1940-43, compared with 3,005 and 2,930 calories in 1944 and 1945. similarly the survey of food consumption in working-class households demonstrates thatthe amounts eaten in the home have fallen short of the nutritional requirement.Throughout the war. unrationed bread was planned to serve as a calorie &quot; buffer.&quot;The restriction of bread consumption could, therefore, confidently be prophesied toreduce the national level of nutrition if it were to produce any real saving of food.The evidence that the place of nutrition has in fact been reduced is at presentcomparatively slight. On the other hand, we must accept that our machineryfor collecting complete evidence is insufficient. Were it more comprehensive other groups at present unsuspected might be found to be insecure. It would, therefore,appear dangerous to overlook the possibility that a slacking of the nutritionalprogress of the war years has occurred.MAGNUS PYKE,Scientific Adviser&apos;s Division,Ministry of Food,March, 1946.1.
