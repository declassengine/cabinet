I. ECONOMIC FLAMMINGIntroductory1. The object of economic planning is to use the national resources inthe best interests of the nation as a whole. How this is done must depend upon the economic circumstances of the country, its stage of political develop-ment, its social structure and its methods of government. The proper systemof economic planning for the United Kingdom must start from this fact, and cannot follow some theoretical blueprint. The following paragraphs describewhat has been done so far. They do not lay down any hard-and-fast system,but rather explain the attempts which have been and are being made to arriveat the best system of economic planning for this country.2. There are over 20 million workers in this country. They work withthe aid of a vast capital equipment of factories, mines, railways, power stations, farms and buildings, which has been gradually built up over thelast hundred years..- They use raw materials drawn from all over the world.This man-power, and the materials and equipment it uses, constitute thenational resources. Together they produce goods and services to a value of nearly well over  8,500 millions a year; this is the value of the total amountof work done by the nation.3. This body of workers and the goods and services they produce mustsatisfy five main national needs :  -(i) Defence. There must be enough men and women in the armed forces to carry out our military commitments, and enough equip-ment must be produced for them.(ii) Payment for Imports. At least half our food is imported, and almost all the basic materials for industry. Enough exports must beproduced to pay for them.(iii) Capital Equipment and Maintenance. The capital equipment of thenation houses, machinery, power, plant, roads, &amp;o. must be con-continually repaired and maintained, and should be steadily modernisedand expanded. More machine-power increases the output perman-hour, and thus the national resources. The production andmaintenance of capital equipment is technically called &quot; invest-ment.&quot;(iv) Personal Consumption. The regular consumption needs of the peoplemust be met by the importation, production, transport and distri-bution of goods, and by the supply of services, such as banking,entertainment and facilities for travelling,(v) Public Services. There must be enough men and women to carry onthe services provided by public authorities, such as education, posts and telephones, police, street cleaning and the public administra-tion generally.There are now special needs under (iii) resulting from the war-time destruc-tion and from six years&apos; interruption of the repair, maintenance and develop-ment of machinery, factories, houses, shops and other buildings.4. These are the claims upon the nation&apos;s work. If more is required forone of these claims, it can be obtained only at the expense of the others, unlessthe total amount of work done is increased. If the total resources are reduced,by unemployment or by a fall in the output per man-year, then less of these requirements can be met.5. An examination of how to carry out the purpose of economic planningso as to achieve full employment was made during the war, and the results were given in the White Paper on Employment Policy (Gmd. 6527) issuedby the Coalition Government in May 1944.6. Shortly after the end of the war, the present Government set upadministrative machinery for economic planning. Some account of this wasgiven in the debate in the House of Commons on 27th and 28th February,1946.7. This organisation came into being at a time when the main nationalneed was to carry out demobilisation, to convert the munitions industries, andto set the civilian economy moving again. Its first task was to examine therapidly changing situation, and to guide it as far as possible so as to ensurethat first things came first. This Paper describes what has happened in the eighteen months since the war ended, and lays down what is required in 1947.The Kind of Plan8. There is an essential difference between totalitarian and democraticplanning. The former subordinates all individual desires and preferences tothe demands of the State. For this purpose, it uses various methods of compulsion upon the individual which deprive him of the freedom of choice.Such methods may be necessary even in a democratic country during the[33099]
extreme emergency of a great war. Thus the British people gave their war-time Government the power to direct labour. But in normal times, thepeople of a democratic country will not give up their freedom of choice totheir Government. A democratic Government must therefore conduct^ its economic planning in a mjanner which preserves the maximum possiblefreedom of choice to the individual citizen.9. Moreover, our methods of economic planning must have regard to our special economic conditions. Our present industrial system is the resultof well over a century&apos;s steady growth, and is of a very complex nature. Thedecisions which determine production are dispersed among thousands of organisations and individuals. The public is accustomed to a wide range of choice and quality in what it buys. Above all, our national existencedepends upon imports, which means that the goods we export in return mustcompete with the rest of the world in price, quality and design, and thatour industry must adapt itself rapidly to changes in world markets.10. It follows that it is of the first importance that planning .in thiscountry should be as flexible as possible. In our determination to avoid the waste of unemployment we must not destroy the essential flexibility of our economic life.11. There are a number of basic industries and services coal, power,steel, agriculture, transport, building the efficient development of which isfundamental to our entire productive activity. A long-term plan is being developed for each of these industries. It must be one of the chief aims ofthe Governments economic plan to see that these programmes are pressed forward as fast as possible, and kept in proper relationship with each other and with the rest of the economy.12. Starting from these considerations, the Government is seeking todevelop a system of economic planning, of which the following are the chiefelements: -(i) An organisation with enough knowledge and reliable information to assess our national resources and to formulate the national needs.(ii) A set of economic &quot;budgets&quot; which relate these needs to our resources, and which enable the Government to say what is thebest use for the resources in the national interest.(iii) A number of methods, the combined effect of which will enable theGovernment to influence the use of resources in the desireddirection, without interfering with democratic freedoms.13. This system makes full use of the successful war-time experience inmanaging the nation&apos;s economic resources. Certain peace-time problems,such as control of balance of payments, can be handled by much the sametechniques as were used for allocating our resources of man-power, materials and shipping during the war. Over the economy as a whole, however, thecircumstances are entirely different. During the war, the Government coulddirect labour and was the direct purchaser of a large part of the nation&apos;production . These two factors gave the Government a control over the courseof production which no longer exists. The Government&apos;s influence in peace-time must be exercised by other less drastic measures.14. The main emphasis so far has been laid upon relatively short-term planning planning for the next year ahead. This was the most urgent need a guide to the vast number of decisions which had to be taken in the short-term allocation of resources. But exactly the same approach can beand is being applied to the longer-term problem, in order to secure a balanced development of the economy as a whole. It is too early yet to formulate the national needs over, say, a five-year period with enoughprecision to permit the announcement of a plan in enough detail to be a useful practical guide to industry and the public. There are still too manymajor uncertainties, especially in the international economic field. But aconsiderable amount of work is being done on these lines, in order to clarifythe national objectives for a longer period ahead than is covered by this paper, and to provide a framework for the long-term decisions of Governmentand industry.How the Plan is made15. For a broad analysis of the national position, economic &quot; budgets &quot;are prepared for the period under, discussion (at present the following year)setting out resources and requirements in terms of (i) man-power;(ii) national income and expenditure.The man-power budget compares the estimated future working populationwith the number of workers required, industry by industry. The national income and expenditure budget compares the estimated value of the national production of goods and services with the value of all the goods and services required.
16. These economic &apos;&apos; budgets &apos;&apos; are prepared by a central staff, workingwith representatives of the Government Departments concerned under anOfficial Committee. On the resources side, the Ministry of Labour forecaststhe working population, and an estimate is made on the best evidence available of the prospective value of output. In regard to requirements, theposition is less simple. Some, such as the man-power for the Armed Forces,originate within the Governmental machine. Others originate outside theareas of Governmental control, but are sponsored by Government Depart-ments; for example, the Ministry of Transport is responsible for stating therequirements of the railways for equipment and maintenance, and theMinistry of Food for stating the estimated expenditure by the public on food.Others again, where no Government control operates, are estimates of whatthe market will claim.17. These statements are supplemented by analyses of particular problems; eg.:  (i) foreign exchange;(ii) investment (i.e., capital equipment and maintenance);(iii) fuel and power, steel and other scarce materials.18. The foreign exchange statement compares our import requirementswith our prospective income from exports, visible and invisible. Considera-tion of this statement, in relation to the rate at which we can afford to spend the United States and Canadian credits, provides the basis for deciding on theone hand the import programme, and on the other the export target. Thelatter is a claim on the man-power &apos;&apos; budget.&apos;&apos;19. The investment statement compares the estimate of what is requiredto be spent on capital equipment and maintenance, with the labour and materials available for the industries which produce equipment, such asbuilding and engineering. The production of the engineering industry mustbe divided between these home needs and the export market. It is also necessary to make sure that the plans under this head are consistent withthe funds which are estimated to become available for financing capitalwork, which is an item in the national income &quot; budget.&quot;20. The statements for fuel and power, steel and other scarce materialsshow the effect upon the whole economy of shortages of these basic supplies.21. At the present time, a first comparison always shows a large excessof requirements over resources. This means that, unless action is taken toincrease resources or to curtail requirements, there will be a scramble for labour and goods. At the end of the period under consideration, it will, ofcourse, be found that these economic budgets will have balanced : no moregoods can in the end be sold than are produced, and no more men andwomen can be employed than are ready to work. The gap between resources and requirements will in the end be closed by some of the requirements being left unsupplied. But if the process of closing the gap is left to chance, somevital requirements are sure to be squeezed out by the less essential. Forexample, if women who are needed in the textile mills go to work in shops,the whole population will go short of clothing and curtains and sheets.22. These economic &apos;&apos; budgets &apos;&apos; are entirely different in character fromthe Chancellor of the Exchequer^ yearly Budget. They deal with man-yearsof work and quantities of goods; these may be totalled in terms of money,for that is the only way to add up the host of things which constitute thenational production and consumption, but the money figures are really ashort-hand for expressing production. The economic budgets must balancethemselves ultimately, for it is impossible to consume more than is produced;the real question is how the balance is brought about. The ChancellorsBudget, on the other hand, deals solely with money; it is his estimate of theGovernment revenue and expenditure, and forecasts a net surplus or deficit on the transactions of the Central Government. The economic &quot; budgets &quot;have a considerable bearing upon the Chancellors Budget, but the two formsof national account are entirely different and should not be confused.Attaining a Balance23. The two economic &quot;budgets &quot; and the various special statementsdescribed in the preceding section are first considered by the Official Com-mittee referred to in paragraph 16. They must be balanced, by measures toincrease resources or to curtail requirements. Otherwise less essentials willpush essentials out of the queue. Too many luxuries will be produced, andnot enough food and clothes and eoal; too many toys and not enough children&apos;sboots; too many greyhound tracks and not enough houses; too much for home consumption and not enough exports to buy our essential imports.24. Resources can be increased by increasing the labour force, or by a bigger output per man-year, or by a combination of the two. On the otherhand, a reduction in the labour force or a reduction in the output per man-year by lower efficiency or by shorter hours or increased holidaysunaccompanied by a compensating increase in hourly output reduces thetotal resources, and means that even less of the requirements can be metthan before.
25. Planning the allocation of resources between the various nationalrequirements is at present a task of deciding which out of a number ofclaimants must go short in other words, which are the more important national priorities. It is precisely the same problem, only on a national scale,as the housewife has to solve every week. On one side are the resources which we have to spend. On the other side are the things upon which we want to spend them. The two must be made to match. After full examina-tion of possible means of attaining a balance, the Official Committee submitsto Ministers a report on the whole position. Ministers then decide what measures should be taken, and their decisions form the basis for subsequentaction.26. The apparatus of Government controls is used to guide the economy in the direction which is indicated by the plan. Over an important part ofthe national economy, the Government can exercise direct influence. Thelevel of Government expenditure approved by Parliament, and the expendi-ture of other public authorities, determines the amount of production of a wide range of goods and services, e.g., education, public housing, supplies forthe Armed Forces; the policies of the socialised industries and services havea substantial effect upon the whole economy, and are ultimately subject toGovernment control. The Governments fiscal policy can exert indirectinfluence over the course of production.27. There are now a large number of direct controls, the purpose ofwhich is to allocate scarce resources of all kinds between the variousapplicants for their use rationing, raw material controls, building licensing,production controls, import licensing, capital issues control, &amp;c. Othercontrols again, such as price control, influence the course of production bylimiting profit margins. Discussion of the controls would be incompletewithout some reference to relative wage levels and conditions of work indifferent industries, since these are of great importance in their effect onthe distribution of the labour force throughout the industrial structure.This issue of wages policy is, however, too wide an issue to be discussed indetail in this White Paper.28. This control apparatus, taken as a whole, can have a substantialeffect upon the course of the national economy. But the controls cannotby themselves bring about very rapid changes or make very fine adjust-ments in the economic structure. To do this, they would have to be muchmore detailed in their application and more drastic in their scope. Indeed,the task of directing by democratic methods an economic system as large and complex as ours is far beyond the power of any Governmental machineworking by itself, no matter how efficient it may be. Events can be directedin the way that is desired in the national interest only if the Government,both sides of industry and the people accept the objectives and then work together to achieve the end.29. This is the basis of the Govermrienfs conception of planning in a democratic society, and it follows clearly from the difference between totali-tarian planning and democratic planning as set out in paragraph 8. Underdemocracy, the execution of the economic plan must be much more a matter for co-operation between the Government, industry and the people, than ofrigid application by the State of controls and compulsions. The government must lay down the economic tasks for the nation; it must say which things are the most important and what the objectives of policj&apos; should be, andshould give as much information as possible to guide the nation&apos;s economic activity; it must use its powers of economic control to influence the courseof development in the desired direction. When the working pattern has thusbeen set, it is only by the combined effort of the whole people that thenation can move towards its objective of carrying out the first things first,and so make the best use of its economic resources.
II__REVIEW OF PERIOD JULY 1945-DECEMBER 1916General30. At the end of the war 42 per cent, of the nation&apos;s man-power was inthe Armed Forces or was directly engaged in supplying them. Only 2 per cent,were producing exports and less than 8 per cent, were providing and main-taining the nation&apos;s capital equipment; the number producing goods and services for consumption was less than 30 per cent, of the whole; theremainder were working in mines, public utilities and transport and in thepublic service. The nation&apos;s main task was to demobilise this war structure and to set the civilian economy moving.31. This has been done with very little dislocation. By the end of 1946,over 4J million men and women had been demobilised from the forces which, when balanced against the intake, has reduced the size of the forces by nearly 3f million men and women; in addition, a further 3$ million had changed over from munitions to civilian work. The proportion of the nation&apos;sman-power in the Armed Forces or directly engaged in supplying them had fallen from 42 per cent, to a little over 10 per cent. In this process, thenumber of unemployed in Great Britain never exceeded 400,000, or 2&amp; percent, of the insured population; outside the Development Areas unemploy-ment has not, in general, exceeded 1J per cent.32. The total employed population at the end of 1946 was some 2 millionsless than in June 1945, partly because women had left industry, partly becausemany demobilised men and women were still on release leave, and partly because there were more unemployed. But the total is still over 1 milliongreater than in June 1939, mainly because of the big fali in unemployment.33. The industrial distribution of this man-power is set out in Table Aat the end of this paper. The number in manufacturing industry and building is now somewhat larger than it was before the war, but within this field there has been a very considerable switch from the textile and clothingindustries to the metal and engineering industries; there is substantially more employment in agriculture, public utilities and transport, but less in mining. The increase in the total employed population and much of theadditional man-power made available by a considerable reduction in distribution and other consumers&apos; services has been absorbed in the increaseof the defence and public services.34. These changes have resulted in a substantial expansion of the national production throughout 1946. , This cannot yet be translated into precise termsof national income; the national income and expenditure figures for 1946will be published as usual in the National Income White Paper which isissued at the time of the Budget. Nor is it possible to make a comprehensivecomparison with pre-war. But in Table B at the end of this paper an analysisis made of production in the fourth quarters of 1945 and 1946 and pre-war.for those items for which comparable figures are available. At the endof 1946:-(i) Production of coal (deep-mined and opencast) was 4 per cent, abovethe level of a year ago and of gas and electricity about 15 per cent,above end-1945.   Gas production was about 30 per cent, above .1938 and electricity production about 70 per cent, above, but coal production was 10 per cent, below 1938.(ii) The quantity of freight carried by the railways had fallen in the lastyear but was still of the order of 25 per cent, more ton-miles thanin 1938-39. There were about 10 per cent, more goods vehicles onthe road than pre-war.(iii) Steel production was as great as in previous peak years and, despite the lack of imports, steel consumption was higher than at any previous peacetime period. Consumption of non-ferrous metals(except for lead) had increased steadily since the last quarter of1945, and was substantially above the pre-war level.(iv) The  merchant  shipbuilding  industry  was  engaged  to its  full capacity, and employment was considerably greater than in 1938;the pre-war output of passenger cars had been nearly recoveredand output of commercial vehicles had increased by 50 per cent,above pre-war. Production of agricultural tractors had been main-tained above the high levels reached during the war, and was more than treble pre-war; in the last year output of agricultural machinery as a whole had increased by more than one-third.(v) The output of certain building materials was still substantially lessthan pre-war; notably, brick production was only two-thirds of the1938 level, although it had trebled in the last 12 months. Cementoutput, on the other hand, had recovered the pre-war level, and output of plasterboard had exceeded it.
(vi) The number of new permanent houses completed had risen to 8,000a month (plus 10,000 temporaries); the rate in 1937 and 1938 was30,000 a month. But 200,000 houses were under constructionat the end of 1946, and a vast amount of repair work was also being done.(vii) Production of cotton yarn, still 40 per cent, below pre-war, had increased by 20 per cent, in the last year; the woollen industry atthe end of 1946 was absorbing raw material at a rate 40 per cent,above the previous year but 20 per cent, below pre-war; rayon yarnoutput increased by 30 per cent, in 1946 and was 50 per cent, above1938.(viii) The agricultural output in 1946 was substantially below 1945,because of the bad harvest conditions. Production of cereals was nevertheless 50 per cent, above pre-war, potatoes 90 per cent,above, sugar-beet 28 per cent; above and vegetables 30 per cent,above pre-war. Milk output was 5 per cent, above 1945, and 20 percent, above 1938; production of livestock products was below 1945and greatly below pre-war; supplies of fish increased by two-thirdsduring 1946, and at the end were above the pre-war level.35. This summary indicates how far the nation had got by the endof 1946 in the development of peace-time production. By the end of theyear the rate of national output was probably not significantly below pre-warover the economy as a whole.36. This expansion of production has given us a start with each of the tasks of reconstruction of the British economy exports, industrial re-equip-ment, repair of war damage, housing, and an increased flow of consumersgoods. The changes in man-power classified broadly according to the usemade of its products are shown in Table C at the end of this paper.Imports and Exports37. The increased need for exports has been of first importance from the start. The development of our overseas economic position was set out in a previous White Paper embodying the Statistical Material presented during theWashington Negotiations (Cmd. 6707). We have lost gold and foreign invest-ments and have incurred new debt to an extent which implies a worsening ofour pre-war capital position in relation to the rest of the world by nearly 6,000 millions (this includes the full United States and Canadian credits,the need for which has arisen from the war). The loss of income from foreigninvestments which this has involved, and the loss of net shipping income, andthe reduction in our export trade to a level considerably short of 50 per cent,of pre-war volume at the end of the war, left us in a highly dangerous tradeposition. Our income from exports at the end of the war, indeed, was enoughto finance only one-quarter of our pre-war volume of imports. The first need was, therefore, a rapid expansion of our export trade in order to buy the food and raw materials which we needed from abroad.38. Particular priority was therefore given to exports, even of products for which there was a pressing need at home. This has been, and will con-tinue to be, necessary, for without these exports we cannot afford the imported supplies which we must have. Our exports expanded very satisfactorily;at the same time, imports did not rise as fast as had been expected, for wehad to contend with serious world shortages of food and raw materials.The volume of our imports and exports as shown by index-numbers repre-senting the quantity of our imports and exports allowing for changes inprices-developed as follows:  Volume of Imports and Exports (1938 = 100)Exports Imports1945-o j        *- 46-2 61-73rd quarter ............ a4th quarter ............ 55&apos;8            53&apos;01946-1st quarter............... 63-22nd quarter ...       ... .   -      - ^8-0            68-3rd quarter ...       ......... 104 3            70 14th quarter ...                           --- ! ! -              tA A39. At the time of the Loan negotiations in Washington, it was esti-mated that our adverse balance in 1946 would be about  750 millions. Theexport drive developed faster than had been expected when these estimates were made, and imports fell below earlier expectations, so the deficit for1946 is now estimated at around  450 millions.   Pull balance of payments
figures for 1946 will be published in the National Income White Paper next april, but the following very provisional figures^) illustrate the position:  1938 1946(  millions)Payments For imports (f.o.b.)      .............      826 1,100Net overseas Government expenditure        ...        13 300839 1,400Receipts From exports and re-exports (f.o.b.) ...      ...      533 900From interest, profits and dividends(a)       ...      175 60From other sources (net)       ...      ...      ...        61 -10769 950Deficit          ..................        70 450(a) Excluding oil, shipping, insurance.40. This deficit of  450 millions in 1946 has been covered mainly bydrawings of $600 millions ( 150 millions) on the United States and of$540 millions ( 130 millions) on the Canadian credits.41. Our balance of payments in 1946 has been more favourable than expected. But this is largely because we have been unable to obtain all thefood and raw materials that we need. Moreover, during 1946 as a whole, therate of expansion of our exports has been no more than enough to balance the rate of expansion of our imports. At the end of 1946, exports were running at 110-115 per cent, of pre-war volume; but these exports, togetherwith our invisible exports, were not enough to pay for imports even at70-75 per cent, of 1938 volume.Capital Equipment and Maintenance42. Of high priority also was the restoration of the nation&apos;s capital equipment, which had worked at great pressure throughout the war, withentirely insufficient maintenance. Our houses and buildings had been heavilybattered from the air. The need was great for housing, re-equipment ofpublic utilities, and the maintenance and replacement of industrial plant and buildings. The engineering industry had to get free of munitions contracts,and convert for civil work; the building and building material industries hadbeen drastically scaled down and had to be expanded again.43. Some expansion of the building and civil engineering industries hadbeen achieved in 1944-45, in order to deal with the repair crisis caused by bombing, and in order to make a start with site preparation for housing. InJune 1945 there were 520,000 employed male operatives aged 16 years andover probably not much more than half the pre-war labour force. The rateof intake through 1945-46 was very fast, however, and by the end of the year the labour force had risen to 943,000 not far short of pre-war.   The distri-bution of this force was as follows:  June December1945 1946fOOO) (&apos;000)New house construction and conversions         ...        60 355War damage repair ...       ...      ...      ...      ...      219 167Industry, agriculture, commerce, utilities       ...        61 165(a)Other (mainly maintenance and repair of houses)       180 256(a)Total employed mals operatives aged16 and over(fa)       .........      520 943(a) Figures at end-October.(b) This is a much narrower definition of building labour than that which relates to the total man-power in building and civil engineering in Table A and elsewhere in this paper.0) Derived largely from Exchange Control operations, showing payments made and receipts obtained during the year. For imports and exports, these figuresdiffer from the monthly trade returns, which are a valuation of goods entering and leaving the country. The import payments are recorded f.o.b., whilst the tradereturns record c.i.f. values, including cost of freight, insurance, &amp;c, on shipmenthere. On this basis, the shipping &quot;receipts&quot; are our net foreign exchangeearnings for shipping the excess of what foreigners pay us for shipping overwhat we pay them and do not include freight earned by British ships in bringingimports to this country is in pre-war balance of trade statistics. The item of receipts from other sources is not strictly comparable with the 1938 figure; it isthe net result of a large number of current transactions (some of an abnormalcharacter resulting from the end of the war) much wider in scope than thoseincluded in the 1938 figures; it includes the net shipping receipts, the net foreign exchange earnings of the oil companies and tanker fleets, film remittances,expenses of tourists abroad, insurance, commissions, remittances by foreign workers, &amp;c.
Virtually the entire increase in the building labour strength has been putinto new housing and industrial building; the expansion in general main-tenance and repair has been almost all offset by the tapering-off of war damage work. It is significant, however, that it has been necessarycontinuously to use over half the building labour force on maintenance and war damage and other repair of houses.44. The effect of. the. building activity during the period under review was that by the end of 1946 nearly 300,000 family units of accommodationhad been made available; 58,000 permanent and 92,000 temporary houseshad been completed, and 202,000 permanent houses were under construction.Building work had been done for industry, agriculture, commerce, and public utilities to a value of around  100 millions.45. Industry&apos;s needs of plant, machinery and vehicles were also verypressing. The engineering industries were better able to make a quick starton civil production than the industries which had lost most of their workersduring the war; they ended the war with good equipment and an expandedlabour force. By the end of 1946 the labour force engaged in satisfying this type of need was well above the normal pre-war level, and, of course, very far above that of mid-1939, when much of the engineering industry was already making munitions.46. It is too early yet to say how much capital equipment and main-tenance work of this sort was done in 1946. It was probably much thesame as in a normal pre-war year. But this does not go far towards making up arrears from six years&apos; deferred maintenance.Consumption47. The public&apos;s need for more goods and services was hardly lessurgent. Food supplies had been maintained throughout the war at a level which was nutritionally adequate, but no better than that. In the six yearsof war the peojde had received less than four years&apos; normal supply of clothing and less than three years&apos; supply of household goods. Much morewas required, both for increasing consumption now and for making goodaccumulated shortages.48. There has, in fact, been a considerable increase in supplies. Thisis shown by the level of retail sales, which at the end of 1946 were running at about 20 per cent, by value above the figure of a year ago. Taking price changes into account, the amount of goods sold is probably not more than10-15 per cent, below pre-war.49. But the improvement has been limited throughout by the worldshortage of food and by the slowness of recovery of the labour force in the consumers goods industries especially textiles and clothing which had beenradically cut down during the war. There would have been far more goodsin the shops if more workers had gone back to these industries. The volumeof exports of the scarcest consumer goods has been small and a switch ofthese supplies from exports to the home market would have made little difference to home consumers but would have seriously jeopardised any hope of re-building the export markets in the future.50. Food consumption has been dominated by the world supply situation.Compared with a year ago, much more fish and fruit are available to thepublic; much the same amount of sugar, milk, meat, eggs and tea, but lesscheese, bacon and fats. In broad terms, the diet remains much the same asit was a year ago; increases in some of the supplies which provide morevariety have been offset by a decline in certain basic foods.51. There has been a very substantial increase in clothing and house-hold supplies since the end of the war. In clothing and footwear there hasbeen an increase of around 40-50 per cent.; in furniture and furnishings of150 per cent.; supplies for the home market of hardware have doubled. Theamount of footwear and clothing in the present ration period is about three-quarters of pre-war and in hardware and hollow-ware and other domesticsupplies the pre-war level has now been reached. Supplies of manufacturedgoods for consumers are still small in relation to the demand, but suppliesof many products are now coming forward at a rate which allows a start tobe made in making up war-time arrears. Throughout this field there hasbeen a great improvement in the amounts which the public can buy.52. There is much more purchasing power in people&apos;s pockets than ever before, and it is more evenly distributed. Full employment, the introductionof minimum standards of living suprjorted by subsidies, higher rates ofnational insurance benefits and old age pensions, family allowances andredistribution of income through taxation all contribute to this fact. subsidies and family allowances alone have added  450 millions to effective purchasing-power in 1946.53. The weight of purchasing power in relation to the supplies available is shown by the fact that nearly one-third of the total of people&apos;s incomesis either taken as direct taxes or is saved. Before the war, this&apos; proportionwas about one-sixth. This shows how important a part has been played bythe people&apos;s saving in 1946; if an attempt were made to use all this purchasingpower, the goods would vanish even more rapidly from the shops.
54. It is clear that to overcome shortages in the shops, it would benecessary for far more plentiful supplies to be available than before the war.For a large section of the people, however, the present food and clothingrations are more than they could normally afford, even in good pre-war yearsand are much more than they could afford in years of depression.55. The effect of this heavy purchasing power has been very apparent inthe consumption of services. This is shown in the very high figures of passenger travel and in the level of expenditure on entertainments which,even adjusted for the increase in prices, is over 50 per cent, above pre-war.In a similar category is the consumption of tobacco, now 30 per cent, above pre-war-war.56. On balance, although consumers&apos; standards have not increased as fast as had been hoped, there has been considerable improvement. At leastpart of the shortage which now exists results from the unprecedentedly high level of purchasing power of the mass of the population.Public Service57. The public service has expanded slightly since the end of the war,and now employs 2,130,000 men and women, compared with 1,465,000 inJune 1939. This covers a varied range of workers teachers, policemen,street-cleaners, storekeepers, Post Office workers, firemen in addition to officials of all grades in national and local government. Of the presenttotal, just over one-fifth are civil servants (excluding the Post Office). Thisis more than double the pre-war figure, but is the inevitable result of theexpansion of the Governments responsibilities in the economic field rationing systems must be maintained as long as severe shortages continue,and the winding-up of war-time activities takes time and man-power. Con-tinuous efforts are made to reduce the claim which public administrationmakes upon the national resources, but a high level of employment in this field compared with pre-war is bound to continue.The Eighteen Months&apos; Besults58. On a broad view of the last eighteen months, the result has beenthat:  (i) The defence sector (armed forces and munitions) has been cut to lessthan one-quarter of its size at the end of the war.(ii) Exports have expanded to nearly 115 per cent, of 1938 volume, anamount still insufficient to pay for imports at 75 per cent, of 1938volume.(iii) A normal pre-war year&apos;s work of industrial equipment and main-tenance has been done in 1946. Industrial development has beencarried out in the Development Areas by involving expenditureof &amp;        millions.(iv) Homes have been provided, by new building and repair, for nearly300,000 families, and the way has been cleared for as fast an expansion in house-building, as the material supplies will permit.(v) There has been little change on balance in food consumption, but aconsiderable expansion in supplies of manufactured goods to thehome civilian market, to levels ranging from two-thirds to over100 per cent, of pre-war.59. This is the way in which the national resources have been used in1946. The general balance has not been unsatisfactory. A beginning hasbeen made with each of the major objectives of reconstruction, and the mostimportant objectives have on the whole had their fair share.60. But the lesson of 1946 is very plain. By the end of the year, thechange-over to civilian production was well on the way to completion. aided by a favourable record of industrial peace, a high level of industrial activity-measured by any standards has been achieved. But this rate of national output is not nearly enough to satisfy the national needs. It has taken usonly the first step towards producing enough exports to buy our imports; ithas no more than begun the task of industrial re-equipment; it has laid the foundation for an expansion of house-building; it has only begun tosupply the quantities of goods and services which the public needs. Seriouslimitations upon output have begun to appear, partly because of shortageof imports, but partly because the basic industries are not producing enough.We have reached a stage at which further expansion of our productive effort is vitally necessary, but at which it presents difficulties which can be overcomeonly by our most vigorous, sustained and combined efforts.
III__THE  SITUATION IN 1947GENERAL61. The central fact of 1947 is that we have not enough resources to doail that we want to do. We have barely enough to do all that we must do.Whether we reckon in man-power, coal, electricity, steel, or national pro-duction as a whole, the conclusion is unavoidable. To get all we want,production would have to be increased by at least 25 per cent. This is clearlyimpossible in 1947.62. There is no reason for surprise about this. We have come throughsix years of all-out effort. We lost less men than some of our Allies ; we were saved from enemy occupation. But our losses, though less obvious, arevery real, and are now making themselves felt first, in our import-exportproblem and, second, in the need for rebuilding our basic industries. Wemust find means to pay for imports which we formerly got in return for our overseas investments, and we must make up six years&apos; arrears of industrial equipment. These are basic things, and to put them right is a huge job ofwork especially as we must at the same time rebuild our battered housing and produce more food and clothing and household goods.63. We could live without new radio sets and furniture, but we cannotlive without imported food. We could indeed at a pinch live without new houses and holidays, but our national existence becomes quite impossible if wecannot produce enough coal and electric power.64. Those things which are fundamental to our national life must comefirst. The danger in our present situation is that there is so much that we want to do, and so much that seems important that too little effort will be concentrated on the things that are really vital.65. The Government has examined the national needs for 1947, and hasdecided that first importance must be attached to payment for imports andto the equipment of basic industries and services. These requirements areexplained below, and are then related to the Governments general plan forthe lay-out of our national resources in 1947, which is a series of practicaltargets, in some cases expressed in man-power, and in others in terms ofproduction. The Government intends to discuss the implications of the planwith the representatives of both sides of industry in order to develop thebest possible means of carrying it out. This paper does not go into detailindustry by industry. Its purpose is to give the broad pattern of nationalwork at which the Government considers the nation should aim. It is a framework, not a blueprint.Imports and Exports66. Imports and exports must take first priority, now and for some years to come. Failure to build up our export trade in the nexu two or three yearsso that we can afford to buy enough imports would mean continued food rationing, much less smoking and private motoring, widespread unemploy-ment for lack of raw materials and inability to re-equip industry with themost modern machinery.67. We need more imports in 1947. In the last year we have beengetting 70 per cent, of the 1938 quantities, and have had to draw on stocks.The 1947 import programme provides an expansion to 80-85 per cent, of1938 volume. But much more than that would be needed to increaserations considerably.68. Our imports are limited both by, what is available and by what wecan afford in foreign exchange. At present, our imports of food (up to therequirements for a certain basic consumption level), feeding-stuffs and essential raw materials are limited primarily by world shortages. Our importsof additional food beyond the basic level, tobacco, petrol and consumers goods are determined by what we can afford. Both considerations affect our importsof machinery and equipment for industry, agriculture, mining, shipping, &amp;c,but normally import is permitted if the machine is of essential importance and cannot be supplied in comparable conditions from United Kingdom produc-tion. As world supplies improve, our imports will be fixed entirely by what we can afford.  We must continue to control their total volume tightly.The Programme for 194769.   The 1947 import programme is as follows:    millions(f.o.b.)Food and supplies for agriculture ...       ...       ... 725Raw materials and supplies for industry ...      ... 525Machinery and equipment (including ships)      ... 60Petroleum products ...      ...       ...      ... 55Tobacco        .................. 50Consumers goods     ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 35Total      ...       ......      ......      1.450(a)(a) For definitions see footnote to paragraph 39. Estimated film remittancesof  18 millions are debited against net invisible income in paragraph 71.
This is not a forecast. The programme is continuously changing with supplyconditions and prices; the figures above show the pattern to which the importing G-overnment Departments are now working. The substantialexpansion over 1946 reflects both increased quantities and increased prices.Growth of imports on this scale involves risks. But it would be false economy in 1947 to create new bottlenecks in addition to those which are created byphysical shortage of supplies.70. There are other claims upon our foreign exchange resources. the costs incurred abroad by the Armed Forces; our share of the cost of Germany;expenditure on relief and rehabilitation and Colonial development and welfare all these, like imports, must be paid for by exports. Likewise,Government receipts from claims arising out of the war, sales of surplusmilitary stores abroad, &amp;c, earn us foreign exchange. The excess of Govern-ment overseas expenditure over Government receipts from overseas may beof the order of  150 millions in 1947, but much of the expenditure and receipts depends upon happenings throughout the world which are outsidethe control of the Government; any figure is therefore a very broad estimate at this stage.71. We expect to have to find in all some  1,600 millions of foreign exchange in 1947  1,450 millions for imports and  150 millions for netoverseas Government expenditure. This must be covered by our exports andre-exports, by our invisible income, or by borrowing from abroad. For reason explained below, the Government considers that it would be imprudent to plan in 1947 to borrow more than  250 millions net. Our net invisible incomemay yield  50 millions. This leaves  1,300 millions to be provided by receipts from exports and re-exports.72. Our exports and re-exports are now running at about  1,100millions a year. A substantial further increase is necessary. To secure this, the Government has set an export target of 150 per cent, of the 1938volume to be reached in the second half of 1947, as against the present level of 115 per cent, of 1938.73. Export targets are being worked out for the individual industries to correspond with the global target, and will be discussed with them shortly.It will be extremely difficult to achieve this target. This year, we cannotexport any significant amount of coal. In order to get the total volume of exports up to 150 per sent, of the 1938 level in the second half of 1947, thevolume of exports of manufactured goods now running at about 130 percent, of 1938 level must therefore rise to about 175 per cent, of the 1938level. Our exports of steel and cotton textiles will not expand further thisyear. Special reliance must therefore be placed upon a further substantialgrowth of engineering, vehicle, chemical and miscellaneous exports.74. The labour force in manufacturing industry already employed onorders for export is more than 50 per cent, above the pre-war level and is capable of further expansion. Nevertheless, these export targets will notbe achieved at all readily, and in some cases it will be impossible to meet them without a reduction in the amount of production available for thehome mazhet.The Dollar Problem75. This lay-out of imports and exports ends with a prospective deficit of  250 millions to be met by borrowing from abroad. This is itself con-siderable alongside the  955 millions remaining of the United States and canadian credits at the beginning of the year. But the drain upon thesecredits in 1947 threatens to be much larger than this. At the middle ofthis year our convertibility obligations under the Anglo-American financial agreement come into operation, and this may result in some loss of dollars.76 Moreover, our dollar position is much more difficult than wouldappear from our total balance of payments. We are now drawing some42 per cent, of our imports from the Western Hemisphere, which is now the main source of the food and raw materials that we must have. But weare selling there only 14 per cent, of our exports. We are thus running largedeficits with these countries. These must be settled in dollars or their equivalent. To much of the Eastern Hemisphere, on the other hand, wetend to sell more than we buy. In a world fully recovered from war, thiswould provide us with the means to settle our deficits with the West. but now many of the Eastern Hemisphere countries have no gold or dollars oressential goods with which to pay; to others we owe large debts which weshall have to repay gradually, and the surplus in our trade with such countries is used up in this way. We, therefore, shall not be able wholly touse our surpluses with Eastern Hemisphere countries against our deficitswith Western Hemisphere countries. To the extent that this occurs, the drain on our dollars will exceed the total deficit of  250 millions.77. This dollar problem within our total balance of payments can be solved in the end only by the economic recovery of Europe and the far east and the establishment of equilibrium in all the major trading countries&apos;balances of payments. The first is necessary to enable us to adjust thepresent distortion in the source of supply of our essential imports. Bothare necessary to enable the Eastern Hemisphere countries to make their currencies convertible and so allow us to use our surpluses with them inorder to match our deficits with the West.
1Qo78. The United States and Canadian credits must last us not only until we have ourselves established a stable balance of payments and are exportingas much as we import; they must last until this special dollar problem is alsosolved. No one can predict how long this will be. But we certainly cannotassume that world recovery will be rapid enough to provide a quick answer to our difficulties.Targets for the Filture79.   Four conclusions follow for 1947:  (i) the export target of 150 per cent, of 1938 volume in the second half-year is of prime importance;(ii) exports to the Western Hemisphere (and some European countries with which we have deficits, viz., Sweden, Switzerland, Portugal)are of particular importance, for they earn dollars or the equivalentand pay for our essential imports from those countries;(iii) close import control must be maintained, particularly of products which come predominantly from the Western Hemisphere;(iv) home production must be increased along lines which contribute tothese policies; the development of our agriculture and shippingare of major importance for this.80. In the longer view, it is abundantly clear that a further expansion,both of imports and of exports, will be needed. The long-term target for exports still stands at 175 per cent, of 1938 volume. The exact increase of exports required will in the long run depend upon the relative prices of imported foods and raw materials and exported manufactures. But it isclear that a very large increase will be needed. The difficulty of maintainingexports on this scale, year in and year out, is entirely insoluble unless Britishindustry is able to compete in quality, price and design throughout the entirerange of manufactured goods. Quality, price and designs will be of crucial importance when the sellers&apos; market becomes a buyers&apos; market and wehave to face keen competition everywhere.81. The basic fact of our position over the next few years, and indeed inthe longer term future, is that we must devote at least 25 per cent, of ourmanufacturing capacity to the production of exports. This means a smallershare for the home market, unless production is increased. We shall indeedrequire to export more than this if we are to get the imports which we need for improving our standards of living. But 25 per cent, of our produc-tion of manufactured goods must be a first charge. A large part of our production is exclusively for the home market; this means that the industries which can export will have to plan for a much larger long-term export propor-tion than 25 per cent, and a far larger proportion than they devoted to exportsbefore the war. There is nothing temporary about our need for exports;concentration upon exports must become a permanent part of our normalindustrial life. Without exports, we cannot get food and we cannot get rawmaterials, and without these, we cannot hope to increase our standard ofliving or even maintain it.Basic Industries and Services82. The second mam national need is to restore the full efficiency and productive power of our basic industries and services. We need an all-roundexpansion in production, but this is impossible without coal, steel, powerand transport. The work of physical reconstruction depends upon thebuilding industry. British agriculture is of decisive importance both for thefood problem and for the foreign exchange problem. Our whole structuredepends upon these basic industries and services. A general expansion ofproduction is impossible without them. The present coal crisis underlinesthis fundamental fact.83. These industries all worked at tremendous pressure in the war years, with depleted man-power and materials If they can be restoredfast, then the whole productive effort can develop smoothly; if they lagbehind, continuing restrictions will impose themselves upon our national production.   They must be established in full health.Coal84. Coal, and power derived from coal, are fundamental to our wholeindustrial programme. Unless we have supplies of coal and power sufficientto meet the industrial demand, and unless the distributed stocks are sufficientto tide over periods when transport facilities fall short of the current demand,there are bound to be stoppages of production.85. In 1946 coal consumption was 194 million tons; inland consumption was nearly up to the peak pre-war level. This consumption was met byproduction of 189 million tons and by drawing upon stocks to the extent of5 million tons. In 1947 not only are there no stocks to draw upon, but wemust provide stocks of coal so as to prevent repetition of this winter&apos;s crisis.A substantially larger production is therefore needed in 1947 than in 1946.86. The lowest target, which we can set for 1947 is 200 million tons ofcoal, deep-mined and opencast.   This is the indispensable minimum.   This
output will suffice only if we press forward hard with coal economy measures,such as conversion to oil-burning and the most stringent economy in non-industrial use of coal, gas and electricity.87. This increase in coal production must be secured by a labour force which, in the. normal course of events, would tend to fall because of the largeproportion of older men in the industry. Last year, recruitment roughlybalanced the loss from deaths, retirement, &amp;c, but this was possible only because of the return of a large number of miners from the Forces. Thereare now 695,000 workers on the colliery books; unless special steps are takento recruit more miners, a substantial decline will take place in 1947.88. The Governments target is to increase the mining labour force to700,000 by the end of 1947. This will be difficult to achieve, because of continous loss of workers from the industry. To attain it, a large recruit-ment of miners will be needed. The policy of the National Coal Board is Tomake the industry attractive enough to draw the necessary number of recruits. The Government will take what steps it can to provide more houses for miners.89. But additional measures are necessary. Underground coal-minerswill therefore be exempt from call-up to the Forces for the next five years.The employment of Poles and other foreign workers in the mines, to whichthe agreement of the National Union of Mineworkers has been secured, canbe a useful contribution.90. Increased output per man-year is as important as the recruitment of more miners. Last year, output of deep-mined coal was 259 tons per man,compared with 808 tons in the peak pre-war year, 1937. Allowing for the contribution which opencast coal can make, the minimum target of 200 million tons can be accomplished if the number of miners remains at its present level, and if output per man-year rises to 275 tons. If the measures takento replace the miners who will be lost to the industry in 1947 prove insuffi-cient, a further increase in output per man-year will be needed. The trend of production in recent months is encouraging, but it is the sustained outputover the whole year that will count.91. Continued expansion of coal production will be needed in 1948 and again in 1949. The expansion of industry will require more power, more steel production, more railway transport, all of which means more coal. We must also obtain a margin of coal for export; the loss of our coal exports sincepre-war days is roughly equivalent to the whole of our wheat imports. More-over, stocks of coal must be re-built. We therefore need a steadily increasingamount of coal. There is bound to be continuous anxiety about supplies untilthe National Coal Board&apos;s long-term reorganisation plans begin to produceresults.92. The Government therefore gives high priority to all measures whichcontribute to increased coal production, such as the production of mechanisedmining equipment, and to all measures which save coal, such as the conversionof engines and plant to oil-burning. The Government intends to institute a vigorous campaign to bring about a substantial reduction in the non-industrial consumption of gas and electricity.93. To sum up, the long-term answer to the coal problem is there organisation of the industry. The short-term answer is an increase in output per man-year, reinforcements to the labour force, priority for equip-ment for the mines, conversion to oil-burning, and intensive economy in non-industrial consumption of coal, gas and electricity.Power94. The electricity shortage results partly from a great expansion of consumption by industry and by domestic consumers, and partly frominsufficient maintenance work during the war, and postponement of thenormal expansion of generating plant. In 1938, electricity production byauthorised undertakings was at its pre-war peak of 24,000 million units; in1946, it was 41,000 million units. In January, it was running 15 per cent,above last year, and was still not enough to meet the demand.95. There is comparatively little more plant for meeting this demandthan there was before the war. The Central Electricity Board has less than9 million kilowatts of plant in service; this winter, the deficit is 1 - 4 millionkilowatts. In this situation, periodic load-shedding is unavoidable. In thenext few years, demand is expected to rise steadily. In spite of a substantialprogramme for the production of generating plant, which will provide800,000 kilowatts of plant in 1947 and 2,600,000 kilowatts by the end of 1949,the position is likely to get worse in the next two years. In the winter of1947-48, the deficit is likely to rise to 1-6 million kilowatts; in thefollowing winter, to 1-7 million kilowatts.96. Although high priority is already given to the production of newgenerating plant, it will take soine years to make up the arrears. In themeantime the situation can be met only by a substantial reduction in theless essential uses of electricity. As already stated, the Government intends to institute a vigorous campaign to this end.
15c5Steel97. The steel shortage results from lack of imports and from lack o coal to maintain maximum production of steel. In 1946, steel output was nearly 12f million ingot tons, compared with the pre-war peak of 13 million tons. In 1947, there is capacity for significant increase, but the effect of thecoal shortage is that target output cannot be put above 13 million tons. This,together with imports, would yield supplies of about 10J million tons of finished steel. Of this, some 1 million tons must be exported, e.g., for foodpacking and for supplying the British oil industry overseas, leaving 9Jmillion tons for consumption here.98. Consumption before the war never exceeded 8J million tons of finished steel. In 1946, it was 8-1 million tons, but rose to an annual rate of 9-2 million tons in the fourth quarter. The amount available in1947 as a whole should be nearly 15 per cent, above that of 1946, and aboutthe same as the rate in the last quarter of 1946.99. If the production target is secured, there will be little gap betweenthe supplies available in 1947 and what industry can actually use with itsfuel supplies and its present labour force except in critical types of steel,such as sheet, strip and tinplate, where there are labour shortages. Theposition should be better in the second half-year than in the first.100. Continued expansion of the big steel-consuming industries, however,might well increase demand for steel (and indeed for non-ferrous metals)bo a point at which it became quite unmanageable. The available steel(apart from special types) will probably suffice to meet the necessary increasein output per man-year by the existing labour force of these industries. Butan expansion in their total labour force, besides preventing an increase inthe under-manned industries, would risk being frustrated by lack of steel.The Government therefore intends to discourage the further expansion ofthis group of industries in 1947, relying upon increased output per man-yearto expand their production to the limits of the available raw material.101. The precarious balance in the steel position is achieved only by cutting steel exports to the minimum. This is a sound policy, for it is better to export finished goods containing steel than to export steel as such. Butit is necessary that the industry should before long be in a position tocontribute directly to the purchase of our imports; an extra million tons ofsteel would buy our whole sugar import requirements. The industry&apos;s long-term development plan assumes home consumption of some 9A- million tonsof finished steel a year much the same as this year&apos;s level and 2J million tons of finished steel exports; this would need 16 million ingot tons of steela year, some of which would in normal years be supplied from abroad.Railways and Shipping102. -The railways also have a large back-log of re-equipment and main-tenance work to be done. In the year before the outbreak of war, the rail-ways carried 316 million ton-miles of traffic a week. During the war,the average was nearly 450 million ton-miles a week. The load is still running at over 400 million ton-miles a week. The railways also had to carry a steadily increasing number of passengers. At the same time, their normal equip-ment programmes were drastically cut; the railway workshops were converted to munitions production; there was neither steel nor timber nor man-power for maintenance on anything approaching the normal scale.103. As a result, the shortage of serviceable rolling-stock has seriouslycurtailed railway capacity throughout the winter. Moreover, the conditionof the permanent way and shortage of timber sleepers may, in a few months&apos;time, make it necessary to impose speed restrictions in the interests of safety. These arrears of maintenance must be made good as soon as possibleotherwise increased production of coal and steel will be held up for lack oftransport.104. The restoration of our shipping is another major task. The merchantfleet in British ownership is 13-9 million gross tons, compared with17-4 million gross tons at the beginning of the war, but this is supplementedfor the time being by a substantial tonnage which we are operating onbareboat charter. Previously, the fleet was a significant earner of foreign exchange; other countries paid us more for carrying their imports than wepaid them for carrying ours. This year, it will probably earn a small balance in our favour (if we are given reasonable time to redeliver to United states the ships on bareboat charter) but the import programme is greatly reduced.If we were importing at a higher level, we should be incurring heavy foreign exchange costs for shipping as well as for the imports themselves. There-fore we must build more ships. The shipbuilding industry is of just thesame importance as an earner of foreign exchange as an industry producingentirely for export. Last year, it produced nearly 1 million gross tons ofships about the same as in 1938. The target for 1947, achievement ofwhich depends upon increased output per man-year and upon adequate supplies of materials, fittings and other components, is If million gross tons,with a large repair programme in additionAgriculture105.   The net output of British agriculture increased by about 35 percent, during the war; intensive mechanisation made British agricultureamong the most highly mechanised in the world, with 190,000 tractors
compared with the pre-war 60,000; output per man-year rose by 10-15 percent. The problem now is to readjust the industry to post-war needs, while retaining the war-time gains in efficiency and developing them still further.10G. The Governments policy, both to save foreign exchange and for good farming, is to switch our production, as rapidly as the cereals positionpermits, from the production of crops for direct human consumption tothe production of livestock and livestock products, especially pigs and poultry. The import of  1,000 worth of feeding stuffs will save nearly  2,000worth of imports of livestock products.107. The world cereal shortage has delayed this policy. This year wemust still have a large production of wheat, potatoes and sugar-beet, andthe target acreages are similar to those of 1945. Except for milk, the supplyof which is steadily increasing, output of livestock products in the year from 1st June, 1947, will be little above that of the current livestock year. Butthe Governments policy is to switch back as soon as it can. Any additionalfeeding-stuffs which become available in the next few months will be usedin the main to increase pig and poultry breeding stock. Present restrictionsmust continue for the 1947 harvest, but farmers will be allowed to retain some of their millable wheat and barley from the 1948 harvest.108. More agricultural workers are required. We shall gradually lose the 80,000 prisoners of war, who are an important part of the standing labour force. The Governments plans for getting foreign labour (see paragraph 125)should help. But the long-term solution can lie only in the establishment ofa prosperous and highly efficient agriculture. The Government will takewhat steps it can to provide more houses for agricultural workers. Theagricultural machinery industry is expanding, and foreign exchange is allowed for the import of machines required for improving efficiency; thefurther increase of output per man-year offers the best prospect of satisfying the industryS man-power problems.109. Allotments and gardens made a considerable contribution to the foodproblem during the war. Those can continue to be an important source of fruit and vegetables.Building110. The building labour force has expanded nearly to the pre-war level, but output per man-year is far below pre-war. Raw materials area serious limitation upon production first, timber; second, structural steel;third, clay products. It has been announced that the building labour force(in terms of total man-power) would be expanded to 1,400,000; the Govem-ment has now decided to base the national building programme in 1947 ona labour force of 1,300,000.111. Timber supplies are critical. We rely almost entirely upon imports.Two-thirds of the requirements of softwoods are for the building programme;supplies in 1947 will be about 10 per cent, above those in 1946, but will be only some 75 per cent, of minimum requirements and less in the first halfof 1947. Moreover, the shortage will last for some years. Timber economy is thus very important as a long-term policy; a wide range of such economies e.g., concrete floors is now in operation.112. The shortage of timber hits the housing programme hardest. Atpresent, 60 per cent, of the labour force is allocated to housing and 40 per cent,to other building work. The programme for house-building in 1947 aims atthe provision of 240,000 permanent and 60,000 temporary houses. There maybe insufficient timber to meet this programme. New construction other thanhousing is limited by supplies of structural steel as well as by timber.Moreover, new projects need power. Close control will therefore continueto be maintained over new construction projects in order to prevent more from being started than can be completed. The Government attaches special importance, however, to the completion of the new factories under con-struction or scheduled for construction in the Development Areas; these factories tap resources of labour which are now unemployed, and positivelyhelp the man-power problem.113. If, as the timber situation develops, it becomes apparent that new housing will be held up, the Government will be ready to make adjustments in the licensing system so as to allow greater freedom for such work as doesnot require scarce materials, including maintenance and repair work.114. Scarcity of materials is a major obstacle to the 1947 building programme. It is not yet clear how far this will prevent attainment of thehousing target, but the Government proposes to meet the situation if itarises by moderating the further immediate expansion of the building labour force and by taking up any slack which may develop by relaxing restrictionson maintenance and repair work which uses little material. There is amplework to be done, at output per man-year far above the present level.The Capital Equipment Programme115. The provision of new equipment and maintenance for the basic industries and services, the building programme, and the work of industrialre-equipment generally represent a formidable task for the nation for manyyears ahead. It cannot all be done at once. There is not enough man-power,steel and building and engineering capacity, especially as a large part of the
latter must be used for exports. The Government must therefore maintainclose control of this type of work; otherwise the building and engineering industries will be jammed, and not even the work of highest priority will bedone. The exercise of this control may postpone some schemes which arein themselves of great value to industry, or of great social value, but this is unavoidable.116. The need for careful scrutiny of capital equipment projects becomesgreater, rather than less, as the pressure upon building and engineeringresources increases. Apart from the big programmes for re-equipment of basic industries and services, the most important projects on the industrialside are those which yield a quick return in terms of increased output perman-year, especially in the under-manned industries. Long-term projectsmust inevitably take second place to projects which will quickly help to solve the special difficulties which are limiting the expansion of the total national production and are distorting its balance. This general principle must under-lie our planning in 1947.117. The Government is aiming at a distribution of work on capital equipment and maintenance in 1947 on the following lines:  Construction  Percent.   Percent.Housing          ...      ...       ...      ...      ... ... 20New industrial building       ...       ...       ... ... other building and maintenance, including war damage repairs     ...      ...      ...      ... ... 2248Plant Electricity, gas, Post Office   ...      ...      ...      ... 9Roads, bridges, docks, harbours, canals, &amp;c...       ... 4Railways, commercial road vehicles, shipping and civil aviation        ...       ...       ...       ...      ... 15Plant for industry, mining and agriculture ...       ... 2452100Statistics are not yet sufficiently comprehensive to enable the investment expenditure to be estimated with great precision. But some indication ofthe scale of programme at which the Government is aiming may be expressedin the objective that during the year 1947 at least 15 per cent, more capital equipment and maintenance work (apart from new housing and housingmaintenance) must be done than was done in a normal pre-war year.What We can do in 1947118. Having examined our economy as a whole, the Government hassought to frame a balanced series of practical objectives for 1947.  They are:  (i) Defence. The nation&apos;s defence needs are examined in a separateWhite Paper (Cmd. ).   This provides for a reduction in the armed Forces from the December 1946 level of 1,427,000 to1,087,000 by the end of March 1948 and a fall in the numbers ofworkers needed for supplying them.(ii) Payment for Imports. Exports must be raised to 150 per cent, of1938 volume by the second half of 1947 (paragraph 79).(hi) Capital Equipment and Maintenance. The housing programme is240,000 new permanent houses and 60,000 temporary houses in1047, as explained in the Housing White Paper (Cmd. 7021). Theamount of capital, equipment and maintenance work (other thanwork on houses) to exceed that of a normal pre-war year by 15 percent, (paragraph 117).(iv) Consumption. Food supplies will not increase much in 1947,because of world shortages. An improvement in the clothing rationmust depend upon a substantial increase in the textile labour force.Supplies of other manufactured goods for consumption should approach the pre-war level by the end of 1947, but between differentitems.the progress will inevitably be patchy, depending mainlyupon the extent of the labour shortage in the various industries,(v) Public, Service. Programmes for education, public health and national insurance to go forward, and a proper degree of efficiency of the public services to be maintained, with special attentionto economy in man-power.119. The achievement of all of these objectives depends upon the basic industries and services, and in particular coal, power, steel and transport.Failure in any of these and particularly failure to produce 200 million tonsof coal in 1947 will set back the entire productive effort.
Man-power120. In order to reach these objectives and at present output per man-year we shall require a larger labour force than can be expected to beavailable unless special measures are taken to increase it. Moreover, thepresent distribution of the labour force, by industries and by places, is not satisfactory; a wide range of industries are under-manned, while others are getting too much man-power in relation to the raw materials available; in wales, unemployment is 7% per cent., while in London and the Midlands itis 1 per cent., and the number of new vacancies notified to the labour exchanges every week far exceeds any possibility of filling them. We haveto look at the problem both in terms of total man-power and in terms of itsdistribution.121. The labour force in civil employment at the end of 1946 was18,123,000. Unless special measures are taken to increase it, this force is unlikely to exceed 18,300,000 in 1947. It will reach this level at about themiddle of the year. In terms of total man-power, the gains to civil employ-ment from subsequent demobilisation will be offset by the raising of theschool-leaving age and other losses to the labour force.122. It would be possible, by delaying the raising of the school-leaving age a few months, to give the productive system an additional 160,000juveniles. The Government has decided that the long-term loss to the nationwould outweigh the immediate gain from this step; the education of children of this age suffered severely in the war and their interests and the long-term interests of the nation cannot be sacrificed.123. For the purpose of estimation, the Government has assumed that unemployment at the end of 1947 will be 400,000, or 2  per cent, of the insured population. In the Development Areas, where unemployment results from the fact that there are not enough factories, the percentage will be higher than this. The cost to the nation in 1947 of this legacy from the pastof unbalanced geographical distribution of our industry is about 150,000 man-years of work. The Government is taking energetic steps to remedy this state of affairs by building new factories, and there is every reason to hopethat unemployment in these areas will be appreciably less at the end of 1947than it is now. But until the new factories have come into full operation,unemployment in the Development Areas will nevertheless be well above therate in the rest of the country, where the allowance made in the estimatesimply covers the delays in adjustment of any economic system with free movement of labour.124. The prospective labour force of 18,300,000 men and women atDecember 1947 falls substantially short of what is needed to reach thenational objectives. . The Government therefore appeals to women who arein the position to do so to enter industry. By doing so they will activelyhelp in the national effort. This applies in particular to those who enter the under-manned industries such as textiles. To encourage this, these industries will need to adjust their conditions of work to suit, so far as possible, the convenience of women with household responsibilities and to accept, as theydid in the war, the services of women on a part-time basis. The government also appeals to those who can do so to contribute to the national task bystaying on at their work instead of retiring. It is to encourage this thatthe pensions arrangements provided in the National Insurance Act offerspecial inducements to old people to postpone retirement, and it would be generally desirable if other pensions schemes which make retirement com-pulsory at a specified age were amended so as to allow retirement to be postponed, with some suitable improvement in the rate of pension. this need to increase the working population is not temporary; it is a permanent feature of our national life.125. Foreign labour can make a useful contribution to our needs. Theold arguments against foreign labour are no longer valid. There is no dangerfor years to come that foreign labour will rob British workers of their jobs.The Government intends to seek every means of employing in civilian work  the Poles who are here or who are coming here and who are unwilling toreturn to their own country. It also intends to extend the recruitment of displaced persons from the Continent to work here. The Government isprepared to ensure that foreign labour will not be introduced into specificemployment while British labour is available. The recruitment of displaced persons for industrial employment is obviously limited by their suitabilityfor work of the kind for which British workers are not available, by theirignorance of the English language and above all by the serious difficulty of finding accommodation for them, particularly if they are accompanied bydependants. But foreign labour is the only substantial additional source ofman-power which is open to us especially for the under-manned industries and the Government intends and believes that with the full co-operation ofBritish employers and workers these difficulties can be overcome.
126. The Government is planning on the basis of an additional 100,000workers from all these sources by the end of 1947, giving a prospective totalcivil employment of 18,400,000. &apos;Target Distribution127. There is also the problem of getting this man-power into the rightplaces. The greatest need is for an expansion in the under-manned industries,and particularly in the textile and clothing industries. Employment in the metal-using industries is already far in excess of the pre-war level and shouldnot be expanded much further. The basic industries (agriculture, mining,public utilities and transport) must be maintained. Although consumers&apos;services, such as distribution, catering, entertainment, &amp;c, are still well below their pre-war level, they are tending to attract too much of the man-powerthat is becoming available as the result of demobilisation, and it is of theutmost importance that only moderate increases should occur in these services in the immediate future.128. The Government has no direct control over the way in whichman-power moves; it can seek to influence the movement in a number of ways, but the ideal distribution of man-power would involve changes of suchmagnitude that it would be impossible to bring them about by any means short of complete war-time direction. Even if direction were used, the transferof labour would be limited by lack of accommodation. The Government sets out the following target distribution at end-1947. This is neither an idealdistribution nor a forecast of what will happen; it represents the approximatedistribution which is needed to carry out the objectives in paragraph 118 andwhich the Government considers can be achieved if the nation as a wholesets itself to achieve it.Target Distribution of Man-Power(Thousands)Actual TargetDec. 1946 Dec. 1947Coal industry(a)         ............         730 740Public utilities          ............         258 280Transport        ............... 1,373 1,370Agriculture and fishing        ......... 1,082 1,120Building and civil engineering^)    ...       ... 1,250 1,300Building materials and equipment ...       ...         628 650Metals and engineering         ...       ...       ... 2,811 2,840Textiles and clothing............ 1,405 1,500Other manufactures   ............ 2,186 2,225Distribution and consumers&apos; services       ... 4,270 4,325Public service(c)        ............ 2,130 2,050Total civil employment^)       ......     18,123 18,400(o) Includes administrative and all other workers engaged in the industry. Thenumber of wage-earners on colliery books was 690,000 at December 1946, and the target is to raise this to 700,000 at December 1947.(o) includes all workers in the industry. The number of male operatives aged16 and over was 943,000 at December 1946, and the target for December 1947 is1,000,000.(c) National and local government, including Post Office, Fire Service and police.(c7) Definitions as in Table A, but foreign labour included in target for December1947.129.   The main considerations underlying this target distribution are:  (i) Special importance and difficulty attaches to coal-mining, agriculture,public utilities; the high rate of loss of men from the mines makeseven a small increase of the existing man-power an extremelydifficult target.(ii) It is desirable that further immediate expansion of the building labour force should be limited because of shortage of timber and other materials; special effort will be needed to meet the target for building materials.(iii) It is desirable that further expansion of the engineering and othermetal-using industries should be limited, not only because theworkers are needed elsewhere, but also because shortage of steel and certain non-ferrous metals will in any case limit additionaluseful employment in these industries.(iv) Employment in textiles and clothing is still 400,000 below pre-war.The proposed increase is as much as can be expected in one year;any increase in the clothing ration is impossible without it.
(v) It is desirable that the expansion of the labour force engaged in transport, distribution and consumers&apos; services should as far aspossible be limited.(vi) A reduction is assumed in the numbers employed in national andlocal government; a thorough review is now taking place.130. Balanced national production requires a big increase in the labour force of some industries and limitation of the expansion of others. The needfor more miners dominates the whole scene. Our food position depends upon more workers in agriculture. The housing programme depends uponmore workers in the building materials industries, as well as upon timber.The clothing ration depends upon more workers in the cotton and woollenindustries; the supply of cups and saucers upon more workers in the pottery-industry. On the other hand, further expansion in the number of building workers, or in the. number of engineering workers, would threaten to causeunder-employment for lack of materials.131. There is no spectacular action which the Government can take,short of direction of labour, to bring about these adjustments. The problemof certain under-manned industries can be greatly eased by the introductionof new machinery and by the provision of better amenities for the workersin them. As much as possible is being done on these lines. But these are for the most part long-term measures, which cannot yield quick results.Output per man-year132. The size and the distribution of the labour force are important,but what ultimately counts is the output which the nation produces. Weshall not attain the objectives described in paragraph 118 without an increaseof output per man-year. In coal and in building, as shown above, output perman-year is far below pre-war; in agriculture, on the other hand, it isappreciably above pre-war. In manufacturing industry the evidence is not-clear; the experience of different industries and probably of different firms in the same industry varies widely. The absence of precise facts on this vital question seriously hinders remedial action. The Government thereforeproposes to invite the representative organisations of industry to co-operate with it in an attempt to establish the facts, now that the first stages of thereconversion have been completed.133. It is clear, however, that there is room for improvement, and that a relatively small improvement all round can have a big effect upon the totalnational production. In the longer view, increased output per man-year is theonly way to expand production and the standard of living. The way to effect this is by the organised combined effort of men, management and machines.Our record of industrial peace since the end of the war is one of which we canbe proud. But more is called for than the absence of industrial unrest. Itis necessary to build up the factories into productive units of the highestefficiency. This is a matter in which the Government is giving industry what assistance it can. With this direct object, it has allocated large resources to industrial equipment and maintenance work in 1947 and is ready to makeforeign exchange available for imports of machinery which increase efficiency.But the job must mainly be one for industry itself.134. The Government also attaches great importance to the introduc-tion of systems of payment and other arrangements which provide themaximum incentive to increase output.185. Over a wide range of the nation&apos;s economic activity transport,distribution, and services generally the idea of output per man-year is lessprecise than in industry, where it can be measured in terms of the number ofthings produced. But the need for the greatest possible efficiency and economy in the use of man-power in these services is no less than in manu-facturing industry, mining, building and agriculture. The claim which theservices make upon the nation&apos;s man-power must be kept as small aspossible, in order that man-power should be available for the productionof goods. Increased efficiency in the supply of services is just as important as increased output per man-year in the production of goods.136. In considering the grave problems presented by the economic&quot; budgets &quot; of requirements and resources, the Government has fixed nationalobjectivea which cannot be achieved without an increase in output per man-year. Action which serves to reduce output per man-year in any industryis directly endangering the attainment of these objectives. The nation cannot afford shorter hours of work unless these can be shown to increase output per man-year. Greater leisure is a very desirable thing, but it is not at themoment a prime essential like imported food. It is not as important ascoal or clothing or housing.
The Distribution of Resources137. If the objectives were reached, the national production would reach a high level in 1947. The national income would not fall far short of  9,000millions, and its distribution might be summarised as follows:  Percentage of NationalIncome1938        1945        1947Personal consumption   ...       ...       ...       78 54 651Defence(a) ............        7 49 104Other public expenditure        ...      ...      10 7 13Capital equipment and maintenance ...       16  6 204Less depreciation ...       ...       ...    -10        - 6        - imports    ...............   -18        -10       -16 Exports     ...............       Hi 4  15Other net overseas receipts     ...       ...        5        - 4        - 1Total     ............    100 100 100(a) The defence figure for 1947 represents gross cost of the Services; sales of surplus military stores are credited against other items in the table.138. This table shows the broad distribution of national effort at whichthe Government is aiming in 1947. It indicates the relationship betweenthe various targets in total terms of national work the high level of iiousingand other capital equipment and maintenance which must be done, theincreased exports winch are needed to offset our loss of other overseasincome, the growth in defence and public service compared with pre-war,the proportion devoted to personal consumption about midway between thelast pre-war year and the last war year. This is the broad lay-out. It show show the results of the national j)roductive effort are distributed between thevarious national needs. But the bigger the total production, the larger theamount available to be distributed.iy conclusion139. In this paper, the Government has set out its conclusions on theeconomic state of the nation. The position which confronts us is grave.Unless we concentrate on the really important things, we may never restore the foundations of our national life our ability to buy imports, and the health of our basic industries and services. This paper sets out targets and objectives for 1947. These embody the Governments determination to putfirst tilings first, and to the extent that Government can directly influenceevents, this will be done.140. It is the Governments responsibility to lay down the national tasks,and to use ail means at its disposal to ensure that they are accomplished.But the Government cannot achieve them by itself. The tasks are for thenation as a whole, and only the combined efforts of everyone can carry them through. The Government therefore invites the attention of industry and thepublic to its plans; it intends to arrange discussion with both sides of each industry of the problems which arise from them; it will welcome constructivecriticism, and it is ready to modify its plan if a case for doing so is made out-There is nothing rigid or final in these plans; they are a working pattern forthe nation which will be adapted and modified as conditions require and as experience shows necessary.141. The successful execution of the plan will demand a new outlookamongst those engaged in industry, an abandonment of the fear of uaempioy-ment and a realisation that our problem is, and is likely to continue to be,an acute shortage of available labour, coupled with a grave danger of shortages in the basic industries and services. To meet this situation will demand aflexibility in approach by both sides of industry and an abandonment of someof those protecting regulations and traditions which have grown up in times of prolonged and massive unemployment. Restrictive practices, whether in production, prices, or employment will be fatal to the solution of our national economic problem. If the whole of our industry can freely direct itself to the attainment of the objectives set out in this paper, the Government believes that we can overcome the very grave difficulties which now confront us.
