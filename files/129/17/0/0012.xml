fHIS DOCUMENT IB THE  PROPEHTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1947SECRET Copy No.CP. (47) 6211th February, 1947CABINETPOLICE COLLEGEMemorandum by the Home SecretaryMY colleagues will, I think, wish to be informed of the proposals I have inmind for the establishment of a Police College for England and Wales.2. An expert committee which was appointed in 1944 to consider thismatter, amongst others, submitted a report last year. Attached is a copy of thisReport, from which it will be seen that the committee recommend (a) that anational Police College should be established to serve the needs of all forces inEngland and Wales, (5) that this College should make provision for a residentialcourse of six months for all potential Police Inspectors, (c) that, in addition, a shorter residential course should be provided for senior officers; and (d) thatcourses might be arranged for officers from overseas forces.3. This report has been discussed with the local authority associations and representatives of the police service. The proposals are generally acceptable toall parties, subject to a point raised by the police authority associations, which Iam prepared to accept, about the appointment of the Board of Governors and theAdvisory Committee.4. I agree with the general recommendations made by the committee and propose to carry them into effect, subject to a modification to enable a few con-stables to go to the College if, through no fault of their own, but simply owing tothe absence of vacancies in the higher ranks of their own force, they have notbeen promoted to the rank of Sergeant.5. In view of the considerable public interest which has been shown in thismatter, I should like now to announce the proposals to Parliament and to thepublic at large. It is impossible within the compass of a reply to a Parlia-mentary Question, or in a statement at the end of Questions, to do full justice tothe scheme, to avoid ill-informed criticism, and to remove widely-held miscon-exceptions. I accordingly propose that a White Paper should be issued, including in the form of an Appendix the whole of the Report of the Police Post-war committee, and explaining that the general proposals are accepted, subject to the modifications referred to above.6. I append a draft of the White Paper, and ask for the approval of mycolleagues to its issue.J. C. E.[33165]b
ANN EXDRAFT WHITE PAPERHigher Training for the Police Service in England and wales. An expert committee, consisting of representatives of the Home Officeand Scottish Home Department, His Majesty&apos;s Inspectors of Constabulary and chief Officers of Police, was appointed by the then Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Scotland (the Right Hon. Herbert Morrison, M.P., and theRight Hon. Thomas Johnston) on 26th May, 1944, to review certain matters affecting the post-war organisation of the police service. Amongst its terms ofreference this Committee was asked to consider the question of the establishmentof a Police College for the higher training of leaders and the organisation oftraining courses for higher ranks.2. The Committee submitted a report on this aspect of its terms ofreference on 30th June, 1946; the Report is set out in full in the Appendix. Itwill be seen that it proposes the establishment of a national Police College toserve all the police forces in England and Wales.3. The arrangements suggested in respect of Scotland are referred to inparagraph 17 of the Report.A proposal to establish a Police School or College in Scotland to serve allScottish forces by providing residential training courses for recruits, officersconsidered suitable for promotion to the rank of inspector, senior officers, andspecialists was approved in 1944 by the Scottish Local Authority associations and the representative bodies of the Scottish police service, and a search for a convenient property or site is proceeding.As separate Scottish arrangements are already in train, the following paragraphs relate only to England and Wales.4. It had always been contemplated1 that when the Report of this expert committee was received, no decision would be reached on its recommendationsuntil there had been consultation with police authorities. Copies of the report were accordingly circulated to. all police authorities in England and Wales, and copies were also furnished to all Chief Constables, to the Superintendents&apos;Central Committee, and to the Joint Central Committee of the Police Federation.5. The Committee&apos;s proposals have now been discussed, with representativesof the County Councils Association and! the Association of Municipal Corpora-tions. His Majesty&apos;s Government have fully considered the recommendations ofthe Committee in the light of these discussions and in the light of the representa-tioiis received from the various branches of the police service and have decidedto accept the principal recommendations made by the expert Committee, subjectto the two modifications referred to in sub-paragraph (b) and paragraph 6 below.In particular. His Majesty,&apos;s Government are proposing to adopt the following arrangements : (a) A Police College should be established on a national basis, open equally to all the police forces in England and Wales.(b) There should be a junior residential course of six months.Normally, the students attending this course would be sergeants who have passed the examination for promotion to inspector and are nominated for the Collegeby the police authority or the chief officer of police concerned; ultimately, it isintended that when sufficient College-trained candidates are available it shouldbe the rule that a man should not be appointed an Inspector in any force unless he has completed the College course.His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise, however, that exceptional cases may arise where a constable is suitably equipped, by ability and by experience, to benefit from a College course, but through the absence of any vacancy in the migher ranks in his own force, and through no fault of his own, has not been promotedto the rank of sergeant. They propose that to meet such cases, in addition to thearrangements contemplated by the Committee, a constable who has passed the qualifying examinations for. promotion to . sergeant and inspector may be nominated by the police authority or the chief officer of police concerned for a
371course at the College. It is clearly desirable that some reasonably uniform practiceshould be followed with regard to this special class of case, and it is accordingly proposed that a constable should not be admitted to the College under these arrangements except with the approval of the Home Secretary, who will beresponsible for seeing that the conditions set out above as warranting an exceptional arrangement of this nature are fulfilled.(c) There should be a senior residential course of three months for officersof the rank of inspector and above for the training of those officers who are to rise to the higher ranks in the police service.6. After considering the views of the representatives of the local authorities,His Majesty&apos;s Government propose that instead of the Committee&apos;s suggestions for the management of the College (referred to in Conclusion (ix) of their Report)there should be substituted the following arrangement: The Board of Governors should consist as to half of representativesnominated by the Home Secretary and as to half of representatives nominated by local authorities. The chairman of the Board of Governors should be nominated by the Board itself, subject to the approval of the Home Secretary.The Board of Governors should be assisted by an advisory committee. Thechairman and members of that committee should be selected by the Board,subject to the Home Secretary&apos;s approval of the appointment of the chairman.7. Particular attention is drawn to paragraphs 9 (5) and 45 of the Com-mittee&apos;s Report. The Committee give in some detail the reasons for which theyadopted the proposal that the junior course should be limited to sergeants whohad passed the examination for promotion to inspector, in preference to a sugges-tion that courses should be provided for selected young constables. The Committeemake it clear, however, that they do not wish their proposal to be regarded asthe last word on the subject, and recommend that the question of providing atthe College., a course open to young constables should be reviewed later in thelight of experience. They emphasise that the proposals which they make willbe likely to succeed only if police authorities and chief officers of police send tothe College a proportion of outstanding young officers. The importance of this consideration is in no way affected by the modification of the Committee&apos;s pro-posals referred to in paragraph 5 (5) above; and this aspect of the problem willbe carefully watched when the Police College has been established.8. It is not yet possible to give any indication of the probable location ofthe College. There can clearly be no question of establishing it in the buildings at Hendon used before the war for the Metropolitan Police College, since these buildings are too small for a College of the kind now contemplated.33105J

FIRST REPORT OF THE POLICE POST-WAR COMMITTEE.To the Rt. Hon. J. Chuter Ede,H.M. Secretary of State for the Home Department,and the Rt. Hon. Joseph Westwood,H.M. Secretary of State for Scotland.Gentlemen,We were appointed on 26th May, 1944, by your predecessors, Mr. herbert morrison and Mr. Thomas Johnston, to consider and report on the principles to he followed in the post-war police service, with special reference, among other subjects, to the establishment of a police college for the higher trainingof leaders and the organisation of training courses for higher ranks. Wehave made progress with all the subjects remitted to us, but in particularwe have pressed on with our consideration of higher training and now submitour Report on that subject. Further Reports covering the remainder of our terms of reference will follow.Higher Training.2. The full Committee has held three meetings, at the first of which,we discussed general principles of higher training and appointed a Sub-Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Frank Brook to consider details.Our thanks are due to this Sub-Committee and to the informal Group underthe Chairmanship of Sir George Abbiss, then Assistant Commissioner, Metro-politan Police, which carried out invaluable preliminary enquiries.At the second and third meetings of the full Committee the subject was further discussed and the suggestions which we now put forward have the unanimous support of all members of the Committee.I. The Case for a Police College; its scope and objects.3. Experience has confirmed the view expressed unanimously by the police council at their meeting on 14th July, 1931, that further provision is necessaryfor the higher and specialist training of police. Probably everyone with know-ledge of the police service and its responsibilities will agree that men who areto fill the higher ranks need an opportunity for study and experience wider than their daily work provides, and that for this purpose a college open to allpolice forces should be established. We do not, however, take this agreement for granted, and before discussing the form which a police college might takewe shall consider whether there is a sound case for the establishment of a police college at all.4. The case for a police college. The aim in the police service, as in allother services, must be to ensure that every post is filled by the person bestqualified to fill it but, other things being equal, it is much to be preferred that a man appointed to a position of responsibility in a police force shouldhave police experience. Policemen carry out most of their work alone, anda police inspector, for example, has not the same opportunity of watchinghis men&apos;s work as, say, an army subaltern. It is therefore all the moreimportant that officers in control of policemen should have served as con-stables themselves. It is also to&apos; ibe borne in mind that, by reason of thegreat numerical preponderance of the lower ranks, promotion prospects inthe police are not good; the goodwill and keenness of the individual constable,on which so much depends, will be greatly stimulated if prospects of pro-motion are not impaired by the introduction of men from outside the servicedirect into the higher ranks.51360
5. If it be agreed that, in the, interests of efficiency and of fairness to the rank and file, the responsible posts in the police service should normally be filled from within the service, then the fact must be faced that the ordinary course of a policeman&apos;s career does not in itself fit him for the higher oreven the intermediate ranks. An inspector, even if lie is promoted at theearliest date permitted by the iPolice Regulations, does not attain that rankuntil he has served five years as a constable and two as a sergeant*, and thegreat majority of inspectors serve far longer than seven years in the twolower ranks. It is true that the work of a sergeant, and even of a constable,provides a certain opportunity for the exercise of initiative and leadershipwhich is denied to the subordinate members of some other occupations.Nevertheless, the constable&apos;s thoughts are bound to be directed largely tothe task of carrying out the complicated provisions of the law and of his ownstanding orders rather than to* the effort of thinking out an original solution to a problem; and his powers of leadership are exercised on members of thepublic, not upon his fellow-constables. In the absence of a college courseof the kind proposed later in this report, there is nothing to counteract, inthe newly appointed inspector, the influence of long service in a subordinatecapacity which, while it provides invaluable experience in some directions,does little to develop, and may actually hamper, the growth of the broadoutlook, the quality of leadership, and the independent habits of mind whichare essential if a senior police officer is to command the confidence of hismen and the respect of all classes of the community.6. In thus affirming that the present system is not calculated to produceleaders in sufficient numbers, we do not wish in any way to suggest that thepresent senior officers of police forces are unequal to their duties. It maythen be objected that, if adequate leaders have emerged up to the present,it should not be necessary to make any new provision for training leaders:the answer is that, for various reasons, the present senior officers enjoyedopportunities of training in leadership and responsibility at an early age which their successors will not. It is true that the experience which some of themacquired during their service as officers in the 19t4-18 war will be matched bythe experience which some of their successors had during the recent war, butin addition some of them secured early promotion in the days when promotionwas rendered more rapid by the system of retirement at 26 years&apos; service,instead of 30, and some of them secured their first promotion when, owing tothe lower standard of general education, it was easier to promote men out ofturn than it is now, and when, for example, a man could join the police at18 and be promoted sergeant at 23 and inspector at 25. What we have tried to do is to work out a long-term plan by which the police service will produceits own leaders without being indebted to any other service for training themand without resort to the hazardous expedient of promoting untried youngmen.7. Training in other occupations. Before considering what kind of training is most suitable for police purposes we think it useful to classify the various types of training provided for leaders and potential leaders in other walks of life.   It seems to us that the main types of establishment are as follows:(i) The &quot; pre-service &quot; training colleges at Dartmouth, Sandhurst, Wool-wich and Cranwell. where boys and young men were, and are, prepared forcommissions in H.M. Forces. The essence of this type of training is thatthe student has no previous experience of the particular profession con-cerned, and that the students are young enough, and the course long* The Scottish Regulations do not require any specific period of service as a sergeantbefore promotion to inspector.
enough, for the moulding of character to play as important a part as theinculcation of skill and knowledge. It is fair to point out also that colleges of this type are concerned with producing officers whose main duty will beto command members of their own service rather than to mix as civilianswith the community at large.(ii) The Staff College. The main feature of a staff college, it seems&apos;tous, is that it is concerned not with all those who hold officer rank in theparticular service but only with the upper strata, namely with those whoare expected to carry out the more difficult technical duties or to command the higher formations.(iii) The University course. Before &quot;and during the war, some universitiesprovided courses of training for officers and potential officers of certain branches of H.M. Forces. Doctors, lawyers, engineers and teachers may do some of their professional training at a university; and in the UnitedStates isoime universities provide training in police duties. Universitytraining, in this country at any rate, is designed to fellow a secondary schoolcourse, and is of full benefit ionly to those who have learned to plan theirc^wn studies to a large extent and to employ their time wisely amid the some-what perplexing variety of opportunities offered by university life.(iv) The &quot; Summer-course &quot;, which is chiefly used in the teaching pro-fession, is a short course of a ;few weeks or even days, the main object ofwhich is not the inculcation of knowledge iby formal lectures, but theexchange of ideas between men and women who are already skilled, or eveneminent, in their particular occupation. It is generally concerned with a fairly narrow aspect of the work.(v) The &quot; officer-cadet training unit &quot;. The intensive courses for potentialities-tial officers in H.M. Forces which were introduced during the war are designed (a) to impart to men who have served in the ranks the additionalknowledge required for officers and (6) to submit the men to a continuoustesting which will supplement the findings of the selection board and revealwhether a man has the personal qualities necessary for command in thefield.8. Factors Peculiar to the Police. In considering how far the kinds oftraining classified above may be of use for police purposes, and what other methods may be needed to meet police requirements, it is necessary to take account of certain features of the police system which have no correspondingfeature in other services and organisations concerned with the training of leaders.(i) Promotion is entirely the responsibility of the Chief Officer of police or the Watch Committee, as the case may be. In most cases a chief constable has the opportunity to acquire, over a period of years, a completeknowledge of the various candidates for promotion; in the police, there-fore, there is not the same need as in some other services for the officers&apos;course to be at once a selection machine and a course of instruction.(ii) Although tire main purpose of police training, like military training,is to develop practical ability rather than to instil theoretical knowledge,police work does not lend itself to&apos; practical exercises to the same extent as military duty. It is nevertheless most important that, while due attention is paid to the theoretical side by lectures and discussions, there shouldbe ample provision for practical work as well. Some paper work theremust be in a college course, and the modern police officer who is withinthe field of promotion should have little difficulty in putting his knowledge5I.-.6O A 4
and his ideas into words; but whatever system is adopted should avoid any danger that mere facility in the handling of papers and the use of english will be mistaken for police ability.(iii) There are certain specialist posts, particularly in the detective branch,the requisite qualities for which differ in some respects from the qualitiesneeded in an ordinary police officer; in some quarters of our large cities,for example, an intimate knowledge of the district and its inhabitantsmight be of more value to a detective than a high degree of general know-ledge and police ability. Moreover, some detectives owe their success toa &quot; flair &quot; which is difficult to define but is not necessarily accompaniedby any particular aptitude for the^normal kind of college studies. Again,a detective officer, even of fairly high rank, is not called upon to exercise the same quality of leadership as the officer whose main duty is to organiseand command a large body of men.(iv) The size of police units of administration varies very widely. It isto be expected that some measure of amalgamation of forces, and of divisions within the forces, will take place in the near future, but it isclear that in any event the instruction will have to be on sufficiently broadlines to be of value to officers whose responsibilities differ considerably in detail.9. Existing types of officer-training in relation to police needs. From thissurvey of police requirements, it is clear that no one of the types of trainingmentioned in paragraph 5 could well be adopted in its entirety for policepurposes.   From each of them, however, something can be learnt.(i) We are in no doubt that it would be a mistake to appoint youngmen without police experience direct to officer rank (that is, to the rank of inspector) in the British police after a course of college training. we recognise the great advantage of having to deal at a college with youngstudents (say up to the age of 23), whose character can be moulded and whose whole outlook on their profession and on life in general can beshaped to accord with the requirements of the service. For the reasonswe have explained, however, we are in no doubt that the interests ofthe service require that officers should be chosen from among men who. have already served for some time in the ranks. The college could,however, deal with young men whose first experience of police work is tobe as officers of police forces in the Empire overseas.(ii) The staff college type of training, which is designed for the upperstrata of the officer ranks, would certainly meet a need which exists inthe police service and some provision of this kind should be made inthe proposed police college; but by itself it would not cover the ground.Officers of the rank of superintendent and above are normally precludedby the size of their commands from being in close daily touch with theirmen; and in order to provide a really effective leavening, to raise the standards and efficiency throughout the service, we think it is necessaryto go down to the rank of inspector. The college should be of benefit,not only to the relatively few men who rise to the higher ranks or whosequalities and achievements justify them in hoping to attain high rank, but toall men who reach the rank of inspector.(iii) Although we appreciate the advantages of a university training,we do not recommend it as a solution to the police problem. The policecourse must avoid any tincture of bookishness, and, moreover, the policestudents would find it difficult, if only on the score of age, to take part with other students in the communal life of a university.   We suggest,
however, that the police college should be situated near a university andwe hope that arrangements could be made for some of the universitylectures and other facilities to be available for the police students, par-ticularly in connection with the research activities of the college.(iv). Short courses of the &quot; summer-course &quot; type have a great value for the exchange of ideas on specific problems, but the need they meet is rather different from the need for a broad training in the middle ranks ofthe service which in our view should be an essential function of the policecollege.(v) Finally, we come to the question of how far the O.C.T.U. type ofcourse would be suitable for police purposes. It has been strongly urged by some members of the police service that, if an attempt is to be madeto find all the senior officers from among the ranks of the service itself,it is necessary to give outstanding men a thorough and broad policeeducation while they are still young enough to derive full benefit from it,i.e., while they are still for the most part in the rank of constable, with aview to a small percentage of the higher posts being filled, at ah earlierage than usual, by men who pass through such a course. It was envisaged by those who pressed this suggestion that besides this proposed longcourse for specially selected men the college would provide a shortercourse for all men who reached the rank of inspector in the ordinary way.The proposal was that entry to the longer course should be by some formof competitive selection open to all policemen, including constables, with more than say five years&apos; service. This is the O.C.T.U. principle ofproviding officer-training for men who have not necessarily reached orneared officer status, and it involves judging a man&apos;s fitness for highrank by an assessment of his potentialities rather than on the record ofhis actual achievements in his job. As we have indicated,- we recognisethat more can be achieved by way of a college course if the students arein their twenties than if it is not given till later; and it cannot be doubtedthat some very good officers would be produced by a course open to young constables. After discussing the subject at length, however, mostof us are against the provision of officer-training before a man has shown by his sendee in the ranks of constable and sergeant that his abilitiesas a practical policeman justify his being placed in the field of selectionfor further advancement. We think that if the proposed course open to young constables were instituted, and whether successful students wereautomatically promoted or not, it might be felt in some quarters that undueweight was being given to what might be described as &quot; disputable &quot;personal qualities such as intelligence, character and personality or toacademic attainments, as against proved police ability and achievements.A scheme for a police college must not only be properly designed to securethe desired object but must be regarded as fair by all members of theservice, and it would be unfortunate if the impression got abroad that theobject of the police college was to secure promotion for a privileged class.We have examined some of the practical difficulties of providing a course open to young constables (the principal one being the selection of suitablecandidates or, looked at in another way, the allocation of vacancies to police forces). They appear to us to be formidable, though not insuperable;but, as we have emphasised, it was on grounds of principle that themajority of the Committee found themselves opposed to the suggestion that two types of course in preparation for the duties of inspector should becarried on pari passu one a short course for men already within the field of promotion and the other a longer course open to all men of more than five years&apos; service without distinction of rank.
We must, however, be guided by experience, and we cannot be unmindfulof the fact that a scheme on these lines was recommended unanimously bythe Dixon Committee*. Accordingly, we do not wish our recom-mendation to be regarded as the last word on the subject, and we therefore recommend that the question of providing at the college a course open to young constables should be reviewed later in the light of experience.10. The type of college suitable for police needs; its scope and objects. Our conclusions so far may be summarised as follows:  The type of higher training needed to raise the standards and efficiency of the police service is training which will broaden the outlook, improve the professional knowledge, and stimulate the energies of men who have reachedor are reaching the middle and higher ranks of the service. The training should also attempt to counteract a certain stiffness in habits of thought whichtends to develop when the impressionable period of a man&apos;s life between 20and 30 is spent in a subordinate capacity. We accept that a course of the kindwe recommend may not effect much in the way of character building; a police officers character is largely formed by the day to day performance of his duties and the precept and example of his senior officers, and an im-portant part of -the training given to the students will deal with their duties as officers in moulding the character of the young constables in their charge.With these considerations in mind, we recommend that the college should provide two main types of course: (A) Courses to prepare men for -the duties of inspector (the &quot; juniorcourse &quot;).(B) Courses to prepare men for the duties of ranks above that ofinspector (the &quot; senior course &quot;).We recommend that there should also be three subsidiary types of courses: (C) Short courses for senior officers.(D) Courses for senior officers of overseas police forces.(E) Courses for overseas cadets and junior officers.We consider that if full benefit is to be derived from these courses theyshould all be residential.11. Course (A) Preparation for the rank of inspector [the &quot; juniorcourse &quot;). In order to secure the fully effective leavening to which we have re-ferred we suggest that men of the rank of sergeant who have passed the examination for promotion to inspector and are nominated by the police authority or the Chief Officer of Police should receive a six months&apos; course atthe college. There would, initially, be no age-limit, though an upper age-limitmight become necessary if there were any tendency to nominate over-maturecandidates.The procedure should be to allocate to each force annually about as manyvacancies as the average number of promotions to the rank of inspector during a year. It would ibe entirely a matter for the police authority or the chief officer of Police to decide which sergeant or sergeants should be sent to thecourse, but it would be natural for those men to be sent who were considered to be the best among the candidates for promotion. We consider thateventually, when sufficient college-trained candidates are available, it shouldbe the rule that a man should not be appointed an inspector unless he has completed the college course.* Report of the Sub-Committee of the Police Council on the Establishment of a police College. H.M.S.O. 30t.fi August, 1930.
The type of subjects which we think should be covered by the course are indicated in the Appendix. The aim should be not merely to extend the students&apos; technical knowledge but to develop their interest in general subjects and to broaden their outlook.(In view of abnormal conditions in the immediate future, when there maybe in a force a number of junior inspectors but no near prospect of furtherpromotions to that rank, it may be necessary to accept temporarily for thiscourse men who have already attained inspector&apos;s rank.)The proposed length of the junior course, six months, is a compromise. Thearguments for so short a course are: (i) Nearly all the students would be married and the prolonged separation of a student from his wife and family might damp his enthusiasm.(ii) The length of the junior course would.be the weightiest factor in thecost of the college.(iii) The length of the junior course is the most important factor in determining the size of the college, which should be small enough for the commandant and instructors to acquire a good personal knowledge of everystudent.Arguments for a longer course are:(a) The average age and experience of the students would be such thatit would take some time for them to accustom themselves to the unfamiliarenvironment.(b) The whole purpose of the course is to cover a wide field without resort to &quot; cramming.&quot;Our view is that six months is none too long a course for the ground to be covered, and that on the other hand six months is quite long enough for astudent to be separated from his wife and family. Moreover, as will be shown later in the report, it appears that a six months&apos; course will enable theannual output to be kept slightly in excess of the number of inspectorsappointed in a year, and will still enable the size of the college to be kept within reasonable bounds. We should, however, add that in our view thearguments for lengthening the course are more convincing than those forshortening it.12. Course (B) for officers who have attained the rank of inspector or ahigher rank (the &quot; senior course &quot;). The junior course must necessarily be designed to suit the capacity of the average inspector; the students cannotbe less than 27 years of age; some may, in the initial stages, be 50 or more,and their average age might be as high as 35 to 40. It would not thereforebe possible in the junior course to give the various subjects the advancedtreatment which is required in preparation for the ranks above that ofinspector. For this reason we consider that, in order to provide training suit-able for the higher as well as for the middle ranks of the police service, it isessential that in addition to the junior course there should be a senior course for men of the rank of inspector and above, the purpose of which wouldbe to improve the students&apos; fitness for carrying out the duties of chiefinspector and higher ranks. The students should work rather by way of theco-operative study of a subject under a syndicate leader than by way of the delivery of formal lectures to a class.At the present stage we are not in a position to make any definite recom-mendation about the length of the senior course, but we envisage a courseof about three months.   The preparation of this seni6r course, which will
10clearly require the most careful consideration and experiment, is one of thepurposes of the short courses for senior officers suggested in the following paragraph.13. Course (C) A short course for senior officers. According to the Reportsof H.M. Inspectors of Constabulary, there were in 1939 about 1,000 officersin the ranks of chief superintendent, superintendent, chief inspector and sub-divisional inspector. There are now rather more. It would clearly be impos-sible, when the college is first established, to attempt to rush the majority ofofficers serving in these ranks through a senior course of the type described in paragraph 12. Yet it is most desirable that all senior officers who have some years still to serve should be given an opportunity of hearing and dis-cussing the latest developments in police technique and that they should havea first-hand acquaintance with the college and in particular should see for themselves what the college is attempting to achieve for their juniors. Wesuggest, therefore, that when the college is first established, a series of shortcourses, of about three weeks in length, should be held for senior officers.Officers attending would:(i) Observe and discuss the junior course.(ii) Consider and discuss the proposals for the senior course.(iii) Hear advanced lectures on police and general subjects, followed bydiscussion and debate.Experiment and discussion in these short courses would make a goodfoundation for the establishment of the senior course (Course B).14. Course (D) for senior officers of overseas police forces. There is a steadyand hitherto1 largely unsatisfied demand for courses for senior officers of over-seas police forces who&apos; are in the United Kingdom on leave. We consider thatthe inclusion of such officers in the senior courses suggested in paragraph 12would not only meet this demand but would be of great benefit to the studentsfrom police forces at home through the exchange of ideas and the introductionof fresh points of view.15. Course (E) for junior officers and potential officers of overseas police forces. There is also a demand for courses for men of about 20 years of age who have been selected for appointment to posts of officer status in colonial and other overseas police forces. These men would require a course of abouta year, in which the police subjects would need to be treated in a moreelementary manner than in the junior course for United Kingdom officers. Thecourse would also have to include, presumably, subjects not required by UnitedKingdom officers, such as the language and law of the overseas territory con-cerned, perhaps tropical hygiene, and so on. The overseas students would, how-ever, profit from the general lectures in the junior course, and while they mightnot have much in common with the United Kingdom students, would nodoubt learn something from them about the general principles of police work,and they would also benefit by contact with the overseas officers on the senior course. We understand that the requirements of forces in the Empireoverseas are expected to amount to about 20 to 25 officers a year; it would hardly be practicable to establish a college for them alone, and their in-clusion in one college with the officers from the United Kingdom wouldeffect a financial saving all round.16. Courses for specialists. We have carefully considered whether specialistcourses in such subjects as criminal investigation and traffic work should beheld at the college. We certainly contemplate that specialist subjects shouldbe dealt with in all the courses listed in paragraph 10. Such instruction, how-ever, would not be given to the students as future specialists but as potential
senior officers who may have specialists under their command. It would bebetter in our view for specialists as such to be trained at the ordinary policeschools or at the headquarters of a large force where specialist work is beingperformed daily, but the question of providing specialist courses at the collegecan be reconsidered, if necessary, at a later stage.II. The Size, Accommodation, Equipment, Situation and ProbableCost of the College.17. Separate Scottish Arrangements. Courses of the type described above for junior and senior officers are to be provided at the proposed Scottish centralpolice training school. It is generally agreed, however, that it would be an advantage for some places in the English senior officers&apos; course to be reservedfor officers from Scottish forces, and vice versa.18. Number of Students__In estimating the number of students attending the junior course, on which the size of the college would mainly depend,we have therefore to take into account the requirements of England and Walesonly. As we have explained above, the number of students passing annuallythrough the junior course should be related to the average total number ofinspectors appointed each year. It is impossible accurately to&apos; forecast thenumber of inspectors that will be appointed annually in future, but the annual average over the 10 years before the war was 300. To put this numberthrough a six months&apos; course every year necessitates provision for 150 studentsunder instruction at one time, but we have put the number at 173 so as toallow a margin for contingencies, in particular the more abruptly fluctuatingrequirements of the smaller forces. The number of officers from English,Welsh, Scottish and overseas forces to go through the senior (3 months&apos;)course each year is estimated at 100, requiring 25 students in residence at onetime. The number of overseas officers and potential officers attending theproposed 12 months&apos; course would be about 25. The total student population would thus be about 225.19. Commandant and Instructional Staff. The Commandant, his Deputy,and the instructors would number about 16 all told.20. Number of administrative and domestic staff. At the District TrainingCentres for recruits, the administrative staff comprises one Secretary (incharge of the domestic and administrative side), one Chief-Clerk/Accountant(in charge of clerical staff and accounts), five clerks, one shorthand-typist,one Catering Officer and one Matron-Housekeeper. It would be necessaryto have a staff of at least this size at the college.The number of the domestic staff depends on (a) the layout of the buildings,(6) whether there iis central heating throughout, (c)&apos; how much, if any,fatigue work is done by the students. It has been assumed that the collegestudents would not make their own beds, clean their own quarters, or workin the kitchen, but that they would wait on themselves in the dining room.We estimate that the non-police staff would then be composed approximatelyas follows:  Higher Staff (Secretary, Accountant, Caterer, Matron)        ... 4Clerical Staff...      ...      ...      ......      ......... 5Kitchen Staff...      ..................... 22Cleaning and outdoor staff ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 16Total..................... 47
21. Married quarters. Assuming that members of the police staff are appointed for 2-4 years (see para. 33) it is probable that a good many ofthem would prefer to bring their families to live at the college. Some of thehigher grade civilian staff might do the same. For the purpose of the estimateit has been assumed that two-thirds of the police and higher grade civilianstaff would have married quarters.22. Total population and accommodation required. The total populationof the college, including instructors&apos; families, would be about 325 and theprincipal accommodation required therefore would be:  Married quarters   ...      ...      ...      ... ... ...       ..      13Bedrooms:Instructors, etc. (one each)     ....... ... 7Clerical and domestic (two per room) ... 22Students (one each)      ...      ...      ... ... 225- 254Class rooms (one per 25 students)...      ... ... ...        ..   .   9Common rooms:Library.Lounges (2).Games Room.Canteen.Instructors Room (2).Domestic staff (2) ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      gOffices:Commandant.Deputy.Secretary.Caterer.Chief Clerk/Accountant.General (2)        ...      ... ... ... .... ... ... 6Dining Room         ...      ... ... ... ... ... ... 1Assembly Hall/Gymnasium ... ... ... ... ... 1Kitchen (including store-rooms, etc.)* ... ... ... ... 1From experience in connection with District Training Centres, the types ofbuilding which afford this kind of accommodation may be classified asfollows:  (a) School and college buildings, if modern, provide the right type of accommodation but are unlikely to be obtainable.(6) Military establishments of a permanent type are excellent if they areof recent construction; but the proportion of obsolescent or temporarymilitary buildings is very high compared with those that would be suitablefor our purpose.(c) Country houses, even large ones, are generally too small for the pur-pose in view; there are very few country houses large enough to house325 people and to provide the class-room and common-room space re-quired. Apart from the plain question of size it has been found that thecountry house almost invariably suffers from two main disadvantages. one is that the bathroom and lavatory accommodation and sewage disposal
i3arrangements are generally far less than what is needed for the maximumpopulation of the house. The other is that the general run of rooms are too small for classrooms and too large for single or even double bedrooms.(d) Hotels and hostels. Hotels are unlikely to become available except where, by the accidents of fashion, a holiday resort changes its character.A type of building which is certainly suitable and may be available is theindustrial hostel, of which several are used for District Training Centres.There are large numbers of single bedrooms and the type of constructionreadily lends itself to the adaptation of a range of bedrooms to form class-rooms or married quarters.The construction of a new building for the police college will no doubt be out of the question for some years, and in any case the construction of a new building ought to be deferred until an assessment of needs can be based onexperience. For the purpose of estimating costs we have therefore assumed that an existing building would be rented. The estimates for rent, fuel, etc.,have been based on those for the District Centres now housed in industrialhostels.23. Situation. It is probable that premises could be found large enough for a college of the size indicated in para. 22 to be concentrated in a singleestablishment, but if it is found when &quot;the scheme is further developedthat more accommodation is required it may be necessary to have two colleges.In any event, premises of this kind are not so plentiful that there is likelyto be much choice of situation. If there is any choice, the two main con-siderations to be borne in mind are that the college should be near a university and near the headquarters of a large force, on account of the needfor obtaining the assistance of outside lecturers and other university facilities and for demonstrating technical and specialist police equipment.24. Equipment. We have not thought it necessary to consider details offurniture and equipment at this stage. As far as present shortages allow,provision should be made to enable the students to work and spend theirleisure hours in reasonable comfort. Practical work will require the pro-vision of equipment to set out a room as a police station, magistrates&apos; court,information room, etc., and of equipment for exercises in road safety and traffic control. There would be no need for anything elaborate in the way oflaboratory or gymnasium equipment.We do not think that at this stage we should make any detailed recom-mendation about the organisation of a library and a museum at the college,but we feel that we should draw attention to the fact that the college would meet a long-felt need by providing a central institution where a first-ratepolice library and museum could be centred, with opportunities for researchwhich have hitherto been lacking.25. Pay of Commandant and Instructors. Experience of District Centreshas shown that an increase of pay equivalent to a step in rank is barelyenough to induce a good man to accept an instructional post outside hisforce. For the purpose of estimating the total cost of the college, it hasbeen assumed that the Commandant would receive (as at the MetropolitanPolice College before the war) the pay of a Deputy Assistant Commissioner inthe Metropolitan Police ( i,325- i,525 at present), his Deputy about  850 andthe instructors the maximum of a Superintendent in a provincial force ( 710).In addition it would be necessary to pay the policem authorities concerned a contribution towards prospective pension at 15 per cent, of pensionable pay.
26. Cost On these assumptions, the following figures provide a roughguide to the probable gross cost of the police college:  I. Adaptations ...      .:.      ...      ...      ...      ...      5,0002.

Items to he set off. (1) If 25 of the 225 students are from overseasforces, then i/9th of the. annual cost (say  5,600) would be recovered fromthe authorities concerned.(2) As the Police Regulations stand at present all the students would beentitled to free board and lodging, as they would be serving away from their homes and forces. The present broad provision made by the Regulations is however designed to cover the ordinary kinds of absence on duty which have arisen up to now, and is not in our view appropriate to the type of lengthyabsence now envisaged, which is a complete innovation in the police service.We commend the suggestion of the Dixon Committee (paragraph 23) that a charge should be made for board, equivalent to the expenditure ordinarilyincurred by an unmarried constable on meals, and that married men shouldreceive a separation allowance equivalent to half the messing charge. If4/5ths of the students were married, the net annual saving might be asfollows: x/jSum recovered by messing charge at 24s. a week ...      ...     14,000Sum payable by way of separation allowances at 12s. a week      5,600Net annual saving    ...      ...      ...      ...     8,400If the savings were effected under both these heads the annual chargefalling to be met by the Home Office and police authorities would be  37,000.The weekly cost per student would be about  3 10s. od. The cost of passinga student through the junior course would be  92 ios. od., and the cost ofeach student attending the senior course would be about  60.28. It may be of interest to note that the Dixon Committee, envisaging acollege of 140 students, mentioned a sum of  30,000  40,000 as the aggregateannual charge for staff, general maintenance, research and travel studyexpenses, but not including anything in the nature of loan charges. To this
the Dixon Committee added  35,000 a year to cover the pay and rent allow-ances of students taking the full (two-year) course, separation allowances(see para. 23 above) and such items as free travel between the college andthe student&apos;s home.29. The fee fixed for the students from provincial forces who, in the lastyear before the war, were accepted for the Metropolitan Police College was 480 per student for the fifteen-months&apos; course.III. The Finance, Management, and Organisation of the College.30. Finance. The college would presumably be financed partly from central, partly from local funds, and we suggest that the part of the cost falling to be borne by local funds should be shared among the several forces in proportion to the authorised strengths. Fees should not be charged in respectof the individual students.31. Management. We suggest that the college should be controlled by aBoard of Governors presided over by the Secretary of State or his representa-tive and composed of H.M. Inspectors of Constabulary, representatives of thecounty police authorities, the city and borough police authorities, and chief constables (we suggest four of each), with representatives of the MetropolitanPolice (in the persons of the Commissioner and the (Receiver or their deputies),and the City of London Police (in the person of the Commissioner). Wesuggest that the Board should itself deal with financial and general matters.We further suggest that the Board should appoint a Committee of Manage-ment under the Chairmanship of an officer of the Home Office and composedof one or more of H.M. Inspectors of Constabulary and a small number of chief Officers of Police, which would meet more frequently and deal withsuch matters as the selection of instructors, the arrangement of the courses and so on.32. The Commandant. The Commandant should be equal in status to a chief Constable, although he need not necessarily be appointed from amongofficers who are already Chief Constables. We suggest that the appointmentshould be a permanent one, and that it should be understood that in any event the holder would be prepared to remain for a minimum period of threeyears.33. The Instructors. The Instructors, one of whom would be the DeputyCommandant, should be drawn from Metropolitan, county, city, and boroughforces. They should be of various ranks, though as no student would hold a lower rank than sergeant the instructors would have to be inspectors at least.The period of service as an instructor should be 2-4 years. We do not thinkthat there should be any difficulty about secondment for this limited period.34. Status of Commandant and Instructors__The Commandant and theinstructors should have the status of police officers and should retain policeconditions of service.35. The arrangement of courses. As far as the senior courses, the shortcourses for senior officers, and the twelve months&apos; courses for overseas officers are concerned, it is clear that the most convenient arrangement would be to run only one course at a time; that is, the whole 25 officers would begin andfinish the course together.With the junior course of 175 students it is possible either for the whole175 to start at the same time and finish together six months later, or forclasses of 25 to start at regular intervals throughout the year.
36. The allocation of vacancies. we suggest that police authorities and chief Officers of Police should be notified, say once a year, of the courses to beheld at the college during the ensuing period. The allocation of vacancieswould be carried out by the Commandant under the directions of the Manage-ment Committee.37. Conditions of admission__(i) For the junior course, we at first had itin mind to suggest, as the condition of admission, that the student shouldhave been provisionally selected for promotion to inspector that is, thepolice authority or Chief Officer of Police, when allocated a vacancy for the junior course, would send the sergeant whom it was intended to promote toinspector at the next opportunity. On consideration, however, this arrange-ment does not appear to be practicable. It is often impossible to make, inadvance, anything like a reliable estimate of the number of promotions thatwill be necessary in a particular period. Moreover, at the beginning it mayserve a better purpose for a force to send an officer who has already beenpromoted inspector, rather than a sergeant who has no prospect of promotionfor some years. We therefore consider the conditions of admission to the junior course should be that the prospective student(a) has attained the rank of sergeant and passed the examinations forpromotion to the rank of inspector or (in the early years of the college)has actually attained the rank of inspector; and(b) has been nominated by the police authority or Chief Officer of police to fill a vacancy allocated to the force by the college authorities.(ii) Similarly, the conditions of admission to the senior course should bethat the prospective student(a) has attained a rank not lower than inspector;(b) has been nominated as in (i) (&amp;) above.(iii) The condition of admission of an overseas student would be that hehad been nominated by a Government Department to which a vacancy hadbeen allotted by the college authorities.(iv) It is difficult to foresee any circumstances in which the college authori-ties would have reason to object to the admission of a particular student,but it seems to us necessary to provide that the Management Committeeshould be empowered to refuse admission in individual cases if such reasonsarise.38. Reports on the students&apos; work. There should be no passing-outexaminations. During the junior course, the Commandant would receive a report on each student at two-monthly intervals. For all types of course,the Commandant should at the conclusion of the course submit a reporton each student to the Management Committee and to the Chief Officer ofPolice or Government Department concerned. There is much to be said on both sides of the question whether these reports should be disclosed tothe student; but, at seems to us that, having regard to the general responsi-bilities of Chief Officers of Police, the only practicable arrangement wouldbe for the Commandant and the Management Committee to keep the reportsconfidential, and to leave it to the Chief Officer of Police to disclose the contents to the student if he wished. It would, however, be necessary for theManagement Committee to lay down careful instructions to ensure that, asthe course went on, a student would be informed of his faults as they appearedto the Commandant and staff, thus giving him an opportunity of correctingthem if they were in fact susceptible of correction.
39. Withdrawal of Students. Since no-one would be sent to the collegeunless his police authority or Chief Officer of Police were satisfied about hisqualifications, it should seldom, if ever, happen that a student made suchpoor progress as to lead the Commandant to the conclusion that he couldnot profit by the course. It seems necessary to provide for such a con-contingency however, and we recommend that before a student is returnedto bis force on the ground that he is unable to profit by the course, the commandant should consult the Management Committee and the police authority or Chief Officer of Police concerned.In our view, it should not be laid down as a definite rule that a man whohad not completed the course should in no circumstances be given a secondopportunity. There would, however, have to be a radical improvement before a police authority or Chief Officer of Police would be justified in nominatinga man for a second course, and second attempts should not be allowed to prejudice the prospects of finding places for other men for their first courses.40. Misconduct. Cases of misconduct too serious to be met by a warningfrom the Commandant would be rare. We have found some difficulty in suggesting a suitable procedure for such cases. On the one hand, it seemsright that the college authorities should have power to send a man awayif he persistently breaks the college rules; on the other hand, an officermight claim with justification that his career should not be seriously pre-prejudiced (as it would be if he were sent away from the college) except by thedecision of his own disciplinary authority. We therefore recommend that,in a case of misconduct which the Commandant considered too serious to bedealt with by warning, he should suspend the officer&apos;s attendance at the college and refer the matter to be dealt with by the disciplinary authority inaccordance with the Police Regulations, which should if necessary be amended to ensure that the Code of Offences against Discipline covers misconduct atthe college. A hearing by the Chief Officer of Police could usually be heldat the college. If a hearing by a Watch Committee were necessary, anywitnesses from the college could travel to the city or borough concerned.If the accused&apos;s explanation satisfied the disciplinary authority, he would return to the college for the current or the following course.41. Pay of Students. Each student should receive the pay and allowances of his rank. In addition, as pointed out in paragraph 27 (2), all studentswould be entitled under Regulation 70 either to free board and lodging or toan allowance for lodging and subsistence. If an allowance is paid under regulation 70, we recommend that a uniform rate should be adopted by allpolice authorities.42. Uniform and status of students__At first no doubt it would be neces-sary for students to wear the uniform of their rank. It has been suggested to us, however, that no distinctions of rank should be made between studentsattending the same course, and we think that there is something to besaid for clothing all students at the junior course in a similar uniform of open-jacket type without rank badges and calling them &quot; Student Inspectors &quot;.This point should be re-examined later in the light of the supply position.43. Leave. The students at the junior course would be mostly married men, and we think that they should be allowed regular weekend leave toenable them to visit their wives and families. For this purpose, eachstudent should be entitled to not less than two travelling warrants duringthe course. Officers attending the senior courses should clearly be at liberty to leave the college at weekends, and the question of free travel in their case would have to be reviewed when the longer course was established.
IV. The Assessment of Ability.44. Clearly it is of the first importance that the college, like any othereducational institution, should be able to carry out a correct assessment ofthe studenfs ability in relation to the duties for- which the course is supposed to prepare him. We have therefore considered the use of modern methods which, originating in the work of industrial psychologists, have had somarked, a success in the Services during the war and are now being widelyadopted in civilian occupations. We understand that these methods, while they include &quot; intelligence tests &quot; of the type used in some police forces for recruiting purposes, consist mainly in a series of practical tests worked out by service officers and psychologists in conjunction, and based on an analysis of the work for which the candidates are destined. We are impressed by the results which this technique has achieved in other fields, and we arealso impressed by the fact that Army candidates for temporary commissioned jrank, even if (rejected, in general express a high opinion of the fairness andaccuracy of these methods as compared with the ordinary process of selectionby examination, interview, and record. We therefore recommend that thepolice staff of the college, with the assistance of properly qualified experts,should study and experiment with these methods in order to ascertain howfar they could be of use to the police service in connection with the work of the college or with other police problems such as promotion.V. The College Courses and Promotion.45. The completion of a college course, like the passing of a promotionexamination, should carry no prescriptive right to promotion nor any priorclaim to promotion over another candidate who has attended a later courseor is supposed to have done less well at the college. In particular, theproposed college is not a contrivance for giving undue weight, in the strugglefor promotion, to youth, brains, personality, or scholastic proficiency ascompared with proved police ability and leadership. Nevertheless, thewhole object of the college courses is to improve the students&apos; fitness foradvancement in the police service, and the success of the scheme depends onthe care and judgment exercised by police authorities and Chief Officersof Police in selecting the best men for the college. Moreover, it must beremembered that it is part of the function of the college to forward the aim off so developing the material available in the police service that all the senior posts can be filled by men who have risen from the ranks. Thematerial is there. The problem before police authorities and Chief Officers ofPolice is to find it and bring it to the fore with faith and courage. To makethe college a success, then, it will be essential for police authorites and chief officers of Police to send there a proportion of outstanding young officers aswell as the men of 35 or so who will form the bulk of the students. If the exceptional officers are given a chance to attend first the junior and then the senior courses while they retain something of youth&apos;s vigour and adaptabilitythe college can make a vital contribution to the maintenance and improvementof police efficiency in the difficult days which he ahead.VI. Summary of Main Recommendations.46.  (i) To raise the standards and efficiency throughout the police servicethere should be a police college open to all forces of England and Wales, andin certain cases, to members of other police forces (paras. 3-9).(ii) All courses should be residential; there should be two main types ofcourse and three subsidiary types (para. 10).
(iii) The two main types of course should be:  Course A (six months); Preparation for the duties of inspector (para. n).Course B (three months); Preparation for the duties of higher ranks(para. 12).(iv) The three subsidiary types of course should be:  Course C (three weeks) for senior officers (to be superseded by type (B)when experience has been gained) (para. 13).Course D for senior officers of overseas and, if desired, of Scottish forces,to be run in conjunction with (B) or (C) (para. 14).- Course E (twelve months) for junior officers and potential officers of overseas forces (para. 15).(v) When sufficient college-trained candidates are available, it should bethe rule that no man should foe appointed inspector till he has completedcourse (A) (para. 11).(vi) The annual output of course (A) should be about 350, that of courses(B) and (D) together about 100, and that of course (E) about 25. courses of type (C) would be a temporary arrangement at the beginning of the scheme,and might deal with about 400 officers a year (para. 18).(vii) The initial cost of the college (assuming the premises to be rented)is estimated, very roughly, at  20,000, and the annual cost at something over  50,000. The annual cost falling to be met by the Home Office and police authorities would be reduced if some contribution were made byoverseas police authorities, and by the students themselves in respect ofboard (paras. 26 and 27).(viii) On the assumption that the college would be financed partly fromthe Exchequer and partly from local funds, police authorities&apos; contribution should be shared among them in proportion to the strengths of the forces(para. 30).(ix) The college should be controlled by a Board of Governors presided overby the Secretary of State or his representative and comprising representativesof police authorities, H.M. Inspectors of Constabulary, and Chief Officers ofPolice. The Board should appoint a Committee of Management under thechairmanship of an officer of the Home Office and comprising one or more of H.M. Inspectors of Constabulary and a small number of Chief Officersof Police (para. 31).(x) Vacancies for the courses should be allocated to the several police forces and to Government Departments (Colonial Office, etc.) according toneeds. It would be for the police authority or Chief Officer of Police to nominate an officer for each vacancy (paras. 36-37).(xi) The officers on the staff should experiment, in consultation withproperly qualified experts, to ascertain whether modern methods of assessingability could be of use (para. 44).(xii) We emphasise the responsibility which lies on police authorities and chief Officers of Police to promote to sergeant and send to the college a proportion of young men as well as the older men who will form the bulkof the students (para. 45).Home Office, Signed on behalf of the Committee,Whitehall.

soAPPENDIXTHE SYLLABUS FOR THE JUNIOR COURSE AT THE POLICE COLLEGEi. The compilation of a detailed syllabus is a matter for the Commandant andhis staff, in consultation with the Committee of Management.The Post-War Committee considered it inadvisable to go into great detail andthese suggestions are therefore confined to:  (i) recommendations on the broad principles which should govern the method and nature of instruction at the college, and(ii) an outline of the subjects which the syllabus should cover.2. Method and Nature of Instruction(a) External Advice. The advice of a University or other expert on higher education should be obtained, and the recommendations following are made subject to reconsideration on the advice of such an expert.(5) Limitation of Lectures. It is not considered possible for students on aresidential course to derive full benefit from more than three lectures in one day.(c) Limitation of Lecturers. No doubt many of the lectures would be givenby visiting specialists invited to lecture within limits clearly defined by a detailed syllabus. There would, however, be a number of resident or regularstaff instructors and it is recommended that no such instructor should beexpected to give more than five different lectures in any one week. Suchinstructors would of course have administrative, supervisory and tutorial duties to perform in addition to the duty of lecturing.(d) Tutorial Facilities. Ample facilities should be given for personal tutorialinstruction and advice. This would require the services of several residentinstructors and the provision of sufficient time to both instructors and studentsto allow of such instruction. Tutorial rooms should be provided, capable of accommodating an instructor and several students.(e) Self Help. One of the most important features of the college should bethe encouragement of students to work for themselves, and to develop anenthusiasm for research and reasoning. It is therefore recommended thatthere should be specific provision for:  (i) Question and discussion periods following each lecture, of at least aslong a duration as the lecture.(ii) Library facilities and plenty of spare time for study in the library amost important aspect of the college work.(Hi) Discussion groups to cover each phase of any particular subject. (Itshould be possible to fit in at least one a week.)(iv) Thesis or paper writing. At least one paper should be required from each student, or possibly each pair of students. The choice of subject should be left to the students, subject to approval.(/) Practical Work should occupy a substantial part of the time-table. Itcan be applied to most of the subjects and can cover, e.g., Scenes of crime Investigation by interrogation Court work Disciplinary and other administra-tive matters.A careful rehearsed demonstration is often as useful as a free practical test,In either case a post-mortem discussion is essential.
3. Subjects to be covered by the SyllabusThe following groups of subjects should be provided for :  A. Police principles historical political ethical legal.B. Police organisation and administration principles of policing, practice and procedure.C. Legal (i) Legal history and constitutional law; the principles of law; the legal profession; and elementary study of the law of torts and of personal property.Elementary principles of local Government.(ii) Criminal law and procedure.D. Science and police work. Forensic medicine, chemistry and physics.E. Semi- or non-professional lectures. A wide range of lectures of this nature should be arranged, to widen the scope of the students&apos; generalknowledge. They should cover matters closely allied to police work, e.g.,penal systems, and should extend to more general matters such as government services, commerce and industry.(51360)   Wt. 18997-985   2500  8/46   d.l.   g. 373
