(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (U7) 9h &apos; COPY NO,18th March,  1 9hlCABINETREPORT ON FOOD DISCUSSIONS IN NORTH AMERICAMem or an clum by the Minister of Food,I.      PURPOSE OF THE VISIT TO CANADA AND THE UNITED STATESMy colleagues will recall that in my minute of21+th January,  19U7,  to the Prime Minister (CP. (i+7) kO)seeking approval for my visit to North America,  I set outthe various issues which I wished, to discuss with theCanadian and United States authorities.Meat.      In order to safeguard our present meat ration,I wished to get the U.S.   allocation of meat for the UnitedKingdom for the first half of this year increased from12,000 tons to 61,000 tons.Sugar.    I wished to  secure some agreement on 191+7allocations which would not rule out the possibility of anincreased domestic ration in the United Kingdom.Wheat.    I wished to obtain some regular,  though small,monthly allocation for the rest of this crop year.Coarse grains.     In order to begin the rehabilitation of our livestock industry,  I proposed to try to obtain1,000,000 tons of maize from U.S.A.Oils and Fats.     I hoped to safeguard United Kingdomsupplies against strong American pressure for an inequitablylarge share of the available supplies.My objects in visiting Canada were:-(i)    to try to ensure that adequate measures weretaker for the more regular and prompt shipment of the balance of the Canadian wheat contractbefore the end of July 19h7;(ii)    to urge upon all responsible Canadian authorities the need for far better transport arrangementsfor the movement of the 19h7-U8 crop in theautumn of 19h7;(iii)   to discuss the possibilities of obtaining   -additional supplies of Canadian beef and bacon.
II.      RESULTS1o        Wheat(a)    The next four months  (remainder of 19u7-U7crop year)The Canadian Government assured me that the quantities of wheat and flour due to us in the first year of the Anglo-Canadian wheat agreement would he shippedon time, that is &quot;by the 31st July.      They know that April,May and June will be difficult months for    us and they have .promised to do all in their power to deliver the bulk ofthe outstanding quantities during those months.      Our most critical period is that of the next 8 weeks.      As a resultof a shortage of boxcars and an exceptionally severe winter,Canadian rail deliveries both to West and East coast  portshave been disappointing,,      However,  I am satisfied thatthe Canadian authorities appreciate the precariousness ofour position and that they are taking all the necessary administrative measures to speed up deliveries.      more encouraging reports were already being received while was in Winnipeg, bub unfortunately shipments from the pacific continue to fail below expectations.Prom the U.S.A. we received an allocation for march of 58,500 tons of wheat and flour (in terms of wheat);and just before I reached Washington an allocation was announced for April of 27,000 tons of wheat,  and 23,000 tons wheat equivalent of flour.      (in addition we were allocated25,500 tons of maize for March and 27,000 tons for April).I explained our immediate difficulties to Mr. Anderson,and while he was unable to increase the allocation for april,  he undertook to give us the entire allocation inthe form of wheat by an exchange with the allocation toGermany.     Although this does not improve our overallsupply position,  it will help us to keep our mills working,since on April 30th an unusually large proportion of oursmall total stock will be in the form of flour as againstwheat.If Canad:an deliveries improve and I can shipthe U.S.  April allocation promptly,  I  shall be able toavoid a cut in the bread ration.      Our stocks at the endof April will, however, be equivalent to only 2.L weeksconsumption of flour in wheat and 2.7 weeks in the formof flour,  a total of 5.1 weeks&apos;  supply.In May and June our stock position should begin to improve.      Not only will Canadian deliveries be speededup, but I am reasonably confident that we shall receive&quot;during those months some allocation,   albeit a small one,from the U.S.      On present expectations,  the U.S.A. will have completed its original 19k6/k7 exPort programme for cereals bythe end of April. &apos;    They are, nevertheless,  hoping to export
substantial quantities during May and June.      The bulk will undoubtedly be in the form of maize or other wheat substitutes.But if their winter wheat prospects coiitinue to be as good as they are now,  they will be willing to reduce their end-of-season carryover,  and continue to export some wheat and flourfrom the old crop.      To what extent they will in fact beable to do this,  will depend on their ability to make furtherpurchases of wheat without driving the market still higher.Mr. Anderson is most reluctant to contributeanything towards pushing the price of wheat to $3 a bushel.I understand that this question is now underurgent consideration by Pood Committee of the U.S.  Cabinet.(no)    The third nuarter 1947.       (1.947/48 crop year)The Canadians recognise that their failure to deliver more than a proportion of the programmed&apos; quantitylast autumn (which prevented us from building up a stockfor this winter),   is largely responsible for our present difficulties.      They agreed with me that a repetition ofthis state of affairs must be avoided at all costs.      I now feel great confidence that given even a reasonably good crop, Canadian performance in the early months ofthe new crop year before the close of navigation nextDecember, will be substantially better this year than itwas in 1946.Prom the U.S.   I asked for 450,000 tons of new crop wheat during the third quarter of this year.Mr. Anderson would have been willing to promise this amount.His officials,  however,  counselled caution in view of the probability of&quot; substantial claims from others on theinternational Emergency Pood Council.      As a result theU.S.  has committed itself,  subject to there being no majorcrop catastrophe or International Emergency Pood Councilcrisis,  to let us buy and ship 300,000 tons during theperiod July-September.      This commitment does not precludeour getting larger quantities.      It is a minimum not a fixed ouantity.(c)    Longer Term ProspectsIt is impossible to give hard figures at this stage,but the above arrangements should mean that our stocks of-wheat and flour will begin to recover steadily as from nextMay.      It should,  I submit,  remain our objective to de-rationbread at the earliest possible moment compatible with safety -if possible not later than the issue of the new ration booksin July.      The saving how being made by bread rationing isnow small.      All our present calculations are made on thebasis of a usage of 100,000 tons of flour a week as against an average usage of 103,000 tons a week before rationing.It  is possible to devise a means of limiting the usage to100,000 tons without rationing, so that we could de-ration
without increasing at all the rate at which we at presentcalculate on using up our supplies.      However,   it is clearlytoo early to consider de-rationing until we can see whether our expectations of increasing supplies are realised.2.      Animal FeedJust after I reached Washington,  I learned that myDepartment had completed negotiations in the Argentine forthe purchase ana,  if possible,  shipment during this year of700,000 tons of maize.       I told Mr..  Anderson about this and said that I would like to get another 700,000 tons from theU.S.   during the 12 months May 1947 to April 1948,  to enable us to make a real start with the rehabilitation of ourlivestock industry.      He was most sympathetic about this objective.      Nor did he doubt that the U. S.  would havelarge quantities of maize available for export.      His onlyfear was whether such an export movement could, be super-imposed upon that for breadgrains, which was alreadystraining their facilities.      I then suggested that wecould move maize through Canada over  the St.   Lawrence,particularly during the summer months when the canadian wheat movement would be at its  lowest.      Mr. Anderson thenpromised me 300,000 tons out of the current crop duringthe third quarter of this year.      Provided that the new crop promises well, he is willing favourably to consider our purchasing further quantities later.      There is to beno limitation upon the use of this maize.      When asked byreporters afterwards &quot;whether this maize was for animal feed,Mr.  Anderson said that it was being shipped for human consumption and industrial purposes, but that its use for animal feed was not excluded.      It would be entirely forthe British Government to decide whether the breadgrainssituation in the U.K.   and generally had improved sufficiently to enable the U. K.   to use more coarse grains for animalfeed.This means that we have secured some 1,000,000 tonsof additional cereal animal feed to be used at our discretionfor the livestock year May 1947/May 1948. &apos;    I am thereforeproposing to the Minister of Agriculture that as from May 1stnext he should restore the cuts  in the animal feed rationswhich we were forced to make in the spring of 1946.3.      U.S.  Meat SuppliesI asked Mr.  Anderson for 75,000 tons before June 30thin addition to the allocation of 12,000 tons which we had gotfor the first quarter.      He promised me 50,000 tons.      Inaddition he drew my attention to the existence of fatstockjust south of the border in Mexico which,   over a period,  mightyield as much as 25,000 tons of good quality beef at reasonable prices.      Mr.  Anderson offered to help us in every way tosecure this meat.      I am having this matter investigatedurgently.Mr.  Anderson asked me if we would buy 10,000 tonsof turkeys,  a part of a substantial surplus quantity whichthe Department of Agriculture was acquiring under a pricesupport programme.      The price pound for pound of meat would&quot;bs no tii0n.ot*  t1 io&quot;n. tri&amp;*fc fox7 -Amgj? ig3.im o of* ss.id. &quot;ttT9.&quot;t I
-;; 6J) 9&amp;3 (%would give this urgent and favourable consideration,      MyDepartment is now considering how these turkeys could hedistributed, so as most effectively to increase our availablemeat supplies.-As a result of this promise of American supplies,provided that they can be shipped promptly,  I hope that Ishall not have to reduce the meat ration .again during thenext few months,  a danger which was very real.4.      Canadian bacon and beefThere is a good prospect of increased supplies ofbacon from Canada.      The upward revision in the price whichwas recently agreed between the Canadian Government and ourselves seems to have had the desired effect, andMr.  Gardiner tells me that he is confident of getting morebacon for us.      The Canadian Government has not   yet decided whether it will subsidise the barley acreage, but it seems certain that some method will be adopted to make hogproduction more profitable.      The prospect of any earlyincrease in the supplies of Canadian beef is much less favourable.      But on the long term something can probablybe done here too.5.      SugarThe negotiations on sugar had been concluded by our officials,  led by my Director of Sugar, Sir William Rook,before I reached Washington.      Sir William Rook, afterdifficult and complex negotiation, and in face of intensepressure for de-rationing from the sugar consuming interestsin America,  succeeded in reaching an agreement with the U.S.Administration which will give us 170,000 tons more sugarthan we had in 1946, not counting quantities allocated, fromuncertain sources such as Java,  etc.      This will enable usto increase the domestic ration from 8 oz.   to 10 oz.  a week as from 27th April with some increases  in the allocations to manufacturers.      As  in past years,  it will be possible togive some bonus issues in the summer,  though not probablyquite as many as last year, when we gave no less than 5.As far as price is concerned (though not as toquantities) this agreement would be upset if Congressrefused to pass the Administration&apos;s present proposalfor continued rationing and price control.From our discussion with Mr.  Anderson andothers,  I feel confident that Congress will pass themeasure though quite possibly after much delay.      increases in U.S.   sugar distribution have already been announced andMr.  Anderson assured me that he would, be entirely happy ifI were to moke a similar announcement before Congress hasacted.6.      Oils and FatsI was relieved that the U. S.   authorities did not raise this question.      I found that as a result of the U.S.having been able to buy 40,000 tons of linseed, oil in theArgentine at a price roughly equal to that at which werecently concluded a purchase, they were not pressing their claims on the International Emergency Food Council asintensively as they had beeti doing.
y 0 9However,  I did. have some discussion or the whole subject of an International Emergency Pood Council oils and fats allocation for 1 9h7 with the Secretary-General of theInternational Emergency Pood Council.      He is, naturally,perturbed at the continued failure to reach agreement andurged me to reconsider the position which we had taken up,i.e-  that we would not allow any supplies from sourceswhich we,  directly or indirectly controlled,  to go toother claimants until we were satisfied that our total requirements for this year would be met.      He suggested,and I am now considering this proposal, that while we shouldbe free to acquire any supplies we can obtain anywhere in theworld we would agree not to retain for our own use this yearmore than 960,000 tons.      There may be something to be said for some such arrangement as 960,000 tons is considerably more than we got last year,  and probably more than we canin fact get this year.7.      Dutch Blockade of IndonesiaAs my colleagues are aware,  the Dutch Governmentis at present maintaining a blockade of Indonesian ports,and arresting British and American ships which attempt to ship supplies from there.      I found that the U.S.  Secretaryof Agriculture was particularly anxious for some parallelAnglo-U.3.  action which would give us    access once again to the food stocks and food production resources ofIndonesia.      This is a matter of the utmost importance tous.      Before the war,  the order of magnitude of exportsof the principal foodstuffs from Indonesian republicanareas were approximately sugar 1,000,000 tons,  oils and fats 300,000 tons (in terms of oil),  tea 67,000 tons andspice 60,000 tons (including in this instance Dutch-heldareas as well),  and substantial quantities of starchessuch as tapioca.      It is now evidence.ent that stocks of someof these commodities are already available for immediateshipment.      We are being denied access by the Dutch toan important source of supply.      On sugar,  for instance,the sterling Indonesian supplies may be of the greatestbenefit to us.Mr.  Anderson favoured the most direct and drasticnaval action to force the Dutch to  suspend their presentblockade of Indonesian ports.&apos;      However,  a necessary preliminary move appeared to me to be to renew the protests-which both we and the U. S. Government have recently made atthe Hague against the stopping of British and U.S.   ships.After consultation with our Ambassador in Washington, whofully concurred as to the great importance of securing a modification of Dutch conduct in this matter,  I telegraphedto my Department to consult with the Foreign Office as tofurther action.Here I only wish to emphasise to my colleagues the vital importance of this Indonesian question for us.It is not too much to say that our future food prospects for sugar, tea and fats depend in a large measure on theearly resumption of trade with Indonesia.
8*      /Attitude of U. S. AuthoritiesI found the attitude of the United states authorities very friendly,      I have &quot;been informed by myofficials that it is the first occasion on which our figand general assumptions as to our objectives have beenaccepted without  question.      This must be attributedpartly    to the American political anxiety about theUnited Kingdom and partly to their dawning fears ofagricultural surpluses.      Although prices - especiallyagricultural prices - are still rising sharply in theU.S.A.  there seems general agreement amongst informedeconomic observers that there should be a downturn inprices in the autumn of this year.      The U.S.  crop of winter wheat promises to be an all time record,  and this with a similar maize crop may force prices downsubstantially.      Already there is a  surplus in some commodities,   evg.   potatoes,  fruit,   eggs and poultry,,It may well be that the coming crop year will see theend of high agricultural prices in the rj. 3.
