S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)s,;l.c,r.jltC.P.CU7) 8211th, March,  1 3hl.CABINETTHE &quot;1939^3TANDaRD&quot; FOR COMPENSATION on compulsory ACQUISITIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. Part II of the Town and Country Planning Act 19I4I+,  andthe corresponding Scottish legislation,  provide that,  for aperiod of five years from 17th November I9I4I4,  compensation on  the compulsory acquisition of land by a Government Department or local authority shall be assessed by reference to prices rulingat 31st March 1939?  with an addition for post-1939 improvements.In the cases of &quot;owner-occupiers&quot;  (widely defined) there was afurther supplement within a maximum of 30% of the value of thebuilding (excluding site)  or,   in the case of agriculturalproperty,  30% of the value of the interest excluding any development value.2. By last summer there was strong pressure from all parties for the level of compensation to be increased,  and by treasury order the 30% maximum was raised to 60% as from22nd July 191+6.      This increase, which benefited only owner-occupiers, met only part of the pressure.      I undertook in debate that the whole question would be re-examined in the autumn.Meanwhile,  the Town and Country Planning Bills were necessarilydrafted on the assumption that the 1939 standard would run itsstatutory five-year course.3* On this re-examinstion,  it seemed to me that the first step should be to dispose of the question of value payments underthe War Damage Act,  which are likewise related to 1939 prices.There is a statutory machinery for the review of these payments and knowledge of what that machinery would produce was anessential preliminary to consideration of  the wider question.k&apos; I therefore set in motion section 11  of the War DamageAct which empowers the Treasury to increase value payments byorder on receipt of a report by the War Damage Commission;    andon the Second Reading of both Town and Country Planning Billsit was indicated that the 1939 standard for compensation on compulsory acquisition would be considered when policy regardingvalue payments was settled.5- The War Damage Commission recommend, briefly,  thatordinary value payments should be increased by k5y&apos;o and &quot;converted&quot;value payments by 60%.       (Converted value payments are those madein cases which would be qualified for &quot;cost of works&quot;  i.e.   paymentof the proper cost of reinstatement were the property not being acquired).      I have decided to accept these recommendations anda Treasury order (which requires an&apos;affirmative resolution of the commons) was laid accordingly on the 6th March.      The War DamageCommission&apos;s report was published on the same date.COPY.NO.
6. The increase in all value payments renders untenablethe 1939 standard as we now have it.      There is such a close connection between what is paid on acquisition of a standing property and what is paid partly as war damage for what has been destroyed, and partly on  acquisition of the site and ruins of a damaged property that it is impossibleto defend 1939 values (plus a percentage) on what has gone,and 1939 values (without addition)  for what has survived.Moreover,  the 1939 standard works harshly in many cases andhardship would be much more widespread as the largeprogram,nes of compulsory acquisition  (new towns,  &quot;blitz&quot;  and&quot;blight&quot;  redevelopment,  etc.) gather momentum.      Criticshave not been slow to point out the inconsistency of basingcompensation and betterment under the new Planning Bills on current values but retaining the 1939 standard for compulsory acquisition.      And pressure on the matter comes even more from our supporters than from the Opposition.7. It is not practicable to apply the new war damagebasis of a percentage increase over 1939 to compulsoryacquisitions because an increase justifiable in respect ofbricks and mortar which is all that is in question with war damage is not justifiable In respect of the sites of thebuildings which enter into acquisitions.      In seeking a new basis, we should try as far as possible to find one which canbe defended for an  indefinite future rather than adopt an artificial expedient which would hove to go back into the melting pot in a year or two1s time.      The natural basis isthat of market value at the date of the acquisition.      I am advised that values are now becoming more settled in general.There is,  however, one type of case where present values arcabnormally high and where it would be inequitable that public authorities should have to pay them.      I refer to propertiespassing with a right to vacant possession.      We must clearly have a safeguard against such excessive prices except wherethe person dispossessed will himself probably have to paysuch prices to re-establish himself elsewhere.8. I therefore propose that,  on compulsory acquisition after a date to be settled,  the 1939  standardshould be replaced by current market value with the qualification that where that value includes the right to immediate or early possession and the owner of it is not himself an owner-occupier (and therefore in all probabilityunder necessity of re-establishing himself elsewhere),  thevalue of the right to possession should be excluded.      Itis proposed to secure this by deeming the property to (be subject to a lease of appropriate duration.      the qualification should become of diminishing importance as more properties become available and the present shortageis relieved and when that time comes,   the qualificationcould be removed from the statute and we should haveeffected a smooth trs isition to the ordinary basis of acquisition simply at market value.
90 There will he strong pressure to make this planretrospective.      There are serious difficulties about  this and we could not in any event go far in advance of theappointed day under the Planning Bills.       I propose to discusthe point with the Ministers concerned with those Bills.I would only say that so far as the new basis starts inadvance of the appointed day,  it would be necessary to exclude from compensation the development value which will disappear on that day.10. I have so framed these proposals that they can been acted in the two Planning Bills,  whose scope is wide enough for the purpose.      And I seek the authority of my colleagues for the introduction of amendments to thoseBills accordingly.11, One further important point must be dealt with at the same time.      The War Damage Commission report pointsout that,  if nothing is done, the owners of property whichis compulsorily acquired and attracts a &quot;converted valuepayment&quot;, will get both the 60% escalation of the valuepayment and, if payable,  the owner-occupier supplement underthe 1944 Act.      This overlap is not right and must be eliminated.      The necessary provision is complicated butit can be secured without asking for a refund from any ownerwhose compensation has been paid.      We shall make an adjustment between the War Damage Commission and theacquiring Authority and the former will not pay the ownerhis increase of value payment in full.H.D.Treasury Chambers,  S.W.1.11th March,  1947.
