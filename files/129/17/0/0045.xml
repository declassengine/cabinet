SECRET - Copy No.ii h March,  1 9U7CABINETSITUATION IN PALESTINEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesMARTIAL LAWStatutory Martial Law was imposed on 2nd March,1947,  in the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem areas.      My colleagues will recall that the High Commissioner took this decision in full collaboration with the military authorities inconsequence of the serious outrages on the night of1st March, and of    the continued refusal of the jewish agency and the Vaad Leumi to call on the Jewish community to co-operate by giving information about the terrorists.On hearing the High Commissioner&apos;s decision, and with theconcurrence of the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence,I at once cabled my full approval of the course he had adopted.      Martial Law was withdrawn at noon on 17th March.2. The Martial Law regulations, which at the time oftheir removal&apos; had been in force 15 days,  involved the complete withdrawal from the inhabitants of the areas concerned ofGovernment services,  e. g. Post and Telegraph, railway facilities,  etc.,  as well as of all private services and movements except of essentials,  such as foodstuffs.      Theeconomic &apos;life of the areas was brought to a complete stand-still, with far reaching reactions, for example on factoriesproducing citrus concentrates for the Ministry of Pood.Diamond, exports and textile output ceased and large-scaleunemployment was created.      No revenue was collected andthe losses incurred by the Government cannot yet be estimated.3&quot;&apos; The imposition- of statutory Martial Law provided an opportunity for the Police and Military to conduct a thorough search for known terrorists.      It resulted in more.(than 60 arrests including 2h known members of the Irgun ZvelLeumi and of the Stern Gang,  and had the effect of bringing about some measure of co-operation by the Jewish community in general in anti-terrorist measures,  although the jewish agency and the Vaad Leumi maintained, their previous attitudeof denunciation of terrorism and some degree of prevention,without effective co-operation with the authorities.      this effect has been sufficiently marked to justify the PalestineGovjruviient in directing an appeal to the Jewish communityover the heads of their official organisations, with theobject of calling for information about named terrorists.i+o Thv, High Commissioner has pointed out that, by itsvery nature,   a regime having the severe effects mentionedabove cannot be maintained for more than a short period
without hardening the attitude of the Jew to the administra-tion,  severely damaging the economy not only of the countryhut of the Government,  and ultimately bringing about riots and disorders.      The imposition of Martial Law was not itself expected to bring terrorism to an end,  and at thetime of its removal it had, in the High Commissionersopinion,  and that of the local military authorities,  reachedthe limit of usefulness.      The military authorities hovethemselves pointed out that,  had it been decided, to retainMartial Law in force longer,  it would have been necessary,in order to maintain the life of the country, to make concessions which would have reduced its effectiveness.The Jewish community hove been given a taste of theconsequences of their continued passive attitude towardsterrorism,  and   it has been made clear to them that theGovernment will not hesitate to reimpose Martial Law ifnecessary as a means of bringing further pressure to bearon them.5. Since the proclamation of statutory martial law,there have been a number of outrages involving the loss of24 lives,  including 13 Service personnel and one Britishcivilian.      During the last month,  5 illegal immigrant ships with a total of 4,199 passengers have arrived in Palestinewaters.      The immigrants have been trans-shipped to Cyprus.There are indications that this traffic is likely to entailan ever increasing strain on our security arrangements,  andat its meeting on 12th March the Defence Committee (D.0.(47)7th Meeting) decided that our naval and air forces must beincreased to meet the commitment and other steps taken withthe Governments condoning this traffic.      Apart from thedifficulties of interception,  a very serious problem will arise over the accommodation of the illegal immigrants,and I have taken up with the Governor of Cyprus the questionof an increase from 20,000 to 30,000 of the number to be housed there.      The possibilitjr of providing further accommo-dation in Kenya is under consideration.      Meanwhile,  theDov Groner appeal to the Privy Council has been adjourned until 25th March and there are now four other terroristsunder sentence of death.      Should they be executed, moreoutrages will most probably occur.      So far as the Arabsare concerned,  the influence of the Mufti continues to grow and his followers, whilst satisfied that the recent conference has involved them in no concessions,  are restlessat any sign of weakening towards Jewry.      H.M.  ambassador at Cairo has pointed out that the Mufti appears to beorganising armed resistance in Palestine from there inspite of the assurances given to the Egyptian Government,and has asked whether the idea of encouraging the Muftito return to Palestine could be favourably examined.      Iam in consultation with the High Commissioner on thequestion.THE POSSIBILITY OP AN INCREASE IN THE IMMIGRATION QUOTA6. A possible means of reducing tension in theJewish community and increasing its co-operation againstterrorism might be to make some increase in the current quota of 1,500 Jewish immigrants a month.      The Foreign Secretary,in his speech to Parliament on 25th February,  indicated thatthere was room for some settlement during the interim periodwithout waiting for U.N.O., and both he and I have subsequentlymet representative Jews on several occasions.      They seemedwilling to discuss  the problem without asking for statehoodor sovereignty, but in terms of some relief in respect ofthe immigration and land regulations.      The plea for anincrease in the quota has also been urged by the leadingrepresentative Jewish bodies other than the Jewish Agency, bythe Advisers on Jewish Affairs to the occupation authoritiesin the British and U. S.   Zones of Germany and Austria,  andin Parliament.
7. There are, however,  substantial objections to anincrease in the ouota at the present time.      It has beensubmitted that such an increase would be premature at this moment, when,   in view of the recent outrages,  it wouldappear to be a direct concession to the terrorists,  andan indication of weakness on the part of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.      Moreover, the Foreign Office have consulted.H, M.  Representatives in the Arab States as to likelyreactions to any proposal to increase the quota beforethe meeting of U.N.0.,  and have received an unequivocalcondemnation of such a course.      An increase in the quotawould undoubtedly provoke a recrudescence of, Arabdisturbance.      The Chiefs of Staff,  at their meeting on14th February (C.0.S.(47) 21st meeting) considered thatthe military commitments would be materially increased ifany relaxation of the present restrictions on jewish immigration were conceded,  and the Defence Committee on12th March agreed that for the present there would be nochange in the monthly quota.      Moreover, within the last few days,  the High Commissioner, whom I had consulted,has informed me that he has come to the definite conclusionthat he could not recommend such an increase at this time,not only on account of Arab reactions,  which he has alwaysregarded as\ surmountable, but on account of the loss of prestige which would be involved and the effect on theBritish community and the Services,  with whose feelingsin the matter he finds himself in complete agreement.S. I discussed the whole question with the foreign secretary before he left for Moscow.      He agreed with methat some easing of the tension in Palestine by a concession on immig-ration might be considered at theappropriate time, but only on certain conditions.      Suchan increase would be granted purely as a humanitariangesture.      There would have to be an improvement in thepresent arrangements for screening the Jewish immigrants to exclude possible recruits to the terrorist organisations,as well as guarantees of co-operation on the part of theJewish organisations including the orthodox Jews as wellas the Agency.&apos;    A concession in these terms, besides givingthe Jews some pre-occupation with the problems of reception,accommodation and assimilation in Palestine, would undoubtedly relieve our difficulties  in regard to bothaccommodation for illegal immigrants and the displacedperson camps in Europe.      If there were any question ofan increase,  it would,  of course, be necessary to makethe strongest efforts through diplomatic channels, withpossibly the co-operation of the United States Government,to secure the acquiescence of the individual Arab States &apos;in any measure proposedj    but the reports from H.M.Representatives referred to in the preceding paragraphindicate that in present circumstances there is little prospect of this being forthcoming,9. On balance,  and having regard to the weight ofopinion summarised in paragraph 7 above,  I feel unable torecommend an increase in the quota at the present moment,although,  as I see it,  this course offers the only hopeof bringing about any immediate improvement in ourrelations with the Jews and relieving the heavy burden on the Palestine administration and the Services.
LAND TRANSFERS REGULATIONS10. The Jews have also pressed for the repeal of theLand Transfers Regulations on grounds of racial discrimination.I have difficulty in accepting many of the Jewish contentions,hut the Anglo-American Committee criticised the regulations as discriminatory,  though they suggested no alternative.The Committee fully recognised the need for protecting thepeasantry hut their only substantive recommendation wasthat &quot;the Land Transfers Regulations of 1940 he rescindedand replaced by regulations based on a policy of freedom inthe sale,  lease and use of land,  irrespective of race,community or creed;    and providing adequate protection forthe interests of small owners and tenant c ultivators1&apos;&apos;.      Inother words,  they merely threw back to the Government theproblem with which the latter had grappled unsuccessfullyfor years, with no suggestion for its solution.11. Because of the difficulties of this matter i submit that it should await the outcome of considerationby U.N.O.   of the general problem of Palestine.      any amendment of these Regulations, even if suitable changescould be devised, would increase our immediate difficulties with the Arabs.CONSIDERATION OF THE PALESTINE PROBLEM BY II. N. 0.12. The Secretary General is at present consulting the Big Five on the proposal that he might appoint a specialCommittee to consider the problem before the meeting ofthe General Assembly in September.      It is understood thatthe Russians, French and Chinese are prepared to agree.The Americans,  however,  have their doubts,  and H.M.  Ambassadorhas been instructed to discuss the position with the state department and ascertain their views.      It is understoodunofficially that the Americans may now be reverting tothe idea of a special meeting of the General Assembly toappoint such a Committee.CONCLUSION13.&apos; I recommend that for the present there should beno increase in the Jewish immigration quota,  and that theLand Transfers Regulations should remain unchanged..
