Ill&quot;IsHHS DQCUMEMTIS THE property of his BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this, paper has been stjictlv, liipjted.     yIt is issued for the personal use of...CP. (47)  5915th February,  1947,CABINETPALESTINEMemorandum &quot;by the Secretary of rate for Foreign Affairs andthe Secretary &quot;of State for &quot;the &quot;Colonies :In accordance- with the decision taken by the Cabineton 7th February,  the proposals annexed  to. CP. (47) 49 were communicated to the Arab Delegations at the--PalestineConference and  to the Jewish Agency for Palestine.      At meetingsheld on 10th February and  12th February respectively,  Zionistrepresentatives and the Arab Delegates declined to accept theseproposals as a basis for further negotiation.2. &apos; The Zionists condemn the British plan&apos;on the groundthat it is likely to lead to the independence of Palestine &apos;as    -a unitary State in which the Jews would, be condemned to thestatus of a permanent minority.      The Arabs say,  on the otherhand,  that the establishment of local government areas enjoyinga measure of autonomy would lead inevitably to Partition.      Theyare also absolutely opposed to the proposal for further jewish immigration.      Both sides are looking beyond the interimproposals for  the administration of Palestine under a five yearTrusteeship to what they- fear would be the logical conclusionof such administration.      Each is  determined to do all in its power  to prevent any step being taken now which might prejudiceits position in five years.&apos;:  time. &apos; : !3. The Jewish counter-proposal is that we should allow the Jewish community in Palestine to build up its strengthunder British protection in aecor.dance with the terms of theexisting Mandate as  it was interpreted before the White paper of 1939.      Prom 1921 to 1932 this  involved moderate jewish immigration at an average rate of between &apos;9,000 and 10,000a year;    but  later,  owing to Hitler&apos;s persecution of the Jews,the figure rose  to a peak of 62,000 in&quot;1935.      Confronted withour refusal to undertake this continuing responsibility in thecircumstances of Palestine today,  they have expressed willingness to consider proposals for Partition.      It is clear from the indications they have given us of the frontier for which theywould, ask,  that,  even if we were prepared to negotiate on thebasis of Partition,  there would be no prospect of Anglo-Jewishagreement on the size of the Jewish State,
4, The Arab Delegations stand by the proposals whichthey submitted to us last September.       If we will notnegotiate on that basis they appear to take the view that ourproper course is to evacuate Palestine and leave  itsinhabitants to settle their own future. &quot;   This is likely tobe their proposal if and when the issue goes to the united nations.      But they would probably prefer that we should remain.in Palestine until the United Nations have consideredthe problem.5. We understand that the latest British proposals have found some&apos;favour in the eyes of non-Zionist Jews and ofsections of public opinion in this country, but the fears of both Jews and Arabs in Palestine are so acute,  and theirmood so intransigent,   that,  in our judgment,  there is no prospect even of acnuiescence in these proposals.      Wetherefore do not advise that His Majesty&apos;s Government should attempt to put this policy into effect on their own authorityalone.       Indeed, we have reached the conclusion that it isimpossible to arrive at a peaceful settlement in Palestineon any basis whatsoever,  except with the backing of theU ni t e d N a t i o ns.6. 1 We might of course do what some of the Arabsappear to wish and evacuate the country now,  leaving theUnited Nations to intervene if no settlement emerges fromthe resulting clash between the two peoples.      We do not recommend, the adoption of  this humiliating course.      Apartfrom the moral responsibility we should thereby incur forthe bloodshed, in Palestine,  it would, be  incompatible with theobligations we undertook when we first accepted  the Mandateand with the resolution on Mandates adopted by the lastAssembly of the League of Nations under which we are committed to administer Palestine in general accordance withthe Mandate until we can agree with the United Nations upono ther arrsngements.7. It seems therefore that we must continue to shoulderour present responsibilities until we can submit the problem to the appropriate organ of the United Nations,  namely,  theGeneral Assembly.      The next annual session of the assembly will &quot;be in September.      Under the Charter,  a special sessionmay be convened by the Secretary-General at the requesteither of the Security Council or of a majority of the member states.      The advisability of asking for a special sessionof the Assembly for  the purpose of submitting the palestine problem has not yet been fully examined, but in view ofthe forthcoming meeting of Foreign Ministers in Moscow itseems unlikely that a special meeting of the Assembly could,be convened, before the beginning of June.      We are thereforeinclined to think that we must proceed on the assumptionthat this matter cannot be discussed by the United Nationsbefore the next regular session of the Assembly inSeptember.
6 08. .We must, however, draw the special attention ofthe Cabinet to the extremely critical  situation which willconfront the Palestine Administration between now endSeptember.      There is reason  to believe that the volume ofillegal immigration will grow as the weather improved.It is highly probable that the interception of theseimmigrants and their diversion to Cyprus will give rise toincidents which will increase the scale of Jewish, terrorismin Palestine.      In any event,   terrorist activity willprobably continue, and the Administration will thereforebe compelled to maintain its present emergency arrangements.Under these the civil Administration Of Palestine is virtuallya besieged garrison,  the members of &quot;which have littlefreedom of movement,  are deprived of their families and are living under an abnormal and continuing strain.      The plightcf the military forces is little better,  and we have repeatedly been warned of the danger of indiscipline amongthe troops if provocation by Jewish terrorists continues.There is no evidence at present suggesting that the j-mabsart; likely to resort to violence in the near future,  outpreparations are actively proceeding among the Arab population.The possibility must be faced that the High Commissionermay be compelled long before September to hand over controlof the country to a Military Administration.9. The risks described in  the preceding paragraphare grave.      On the other hand, the knowledge thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government intana to submit the whole problem to the United nations might  in the interim have a.restraining influence on both peoples.      It is therefor of the highest importance that,  if the Cabinet decide infavour of reference to the United nations,  this decision should be made public without delay.10. The announcement of such a decision would havethe further advantage of reducing the danger that some otherPower would place the Palestine situation on the agenda ofthe Security Council.      There is no immediate sign that anyof the Arab States intends to take this step,  but circumstances might arise in which they would wish to do so.      If, forinstance,  we sought to increase the rate of Jewish immigrationabove the existing 1500 a month at any time between now and september, it is almoot certain tha.t the ^arabs would raisethe whole Palestine question in the Security council.11. We have  stated above that the prospect of referenceto the United Nations might deter both Arabs and Jews fromresorting to violence,  because neither people would wish to prejudice its case in the eyes of the General Assembly.From this point of view it would also be desirable thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should refrain from taking any step which might be regarded as prejudicing the issues to bosubmit&quot;Ged to the Assembly.      This would mean maintaining thestatus quo in Palestine between now and September.      It maybe,  however,  that on further consideration it will he found impossible on political or administrative grounds to avoidsome relaxation of the present restrictions on jewish immigration;    and we think it right to warn our colleagues that we may hive to submit further proposals on this point.
P 4OJ.-\2. Our proposals,  therefore,  are -(1)    That His Majesty&apos;s Government should giveimmediate notice of their intention to refer the problem of Palestine to the  judgment of theGeneral assembly;(2)    That His Majesty1s Government  should continue to administer the existing Mandate in Palestineuntil the next regular session of the general assembly of the United nations.13* There remains to be considered the form in &quot;whichthe problem should be presented to the United nations.    Onthis we suggest that the British statement should begin withan historical account of  the discharge of our trust inPalestine.      It would point out that the Mandate has proved to be unworkablej,  that it has imposed on the Mandatory  inimpossible task,  and that the obligations undertaken to thetwo communities rave proved irreconcilable.      It would goon to describe  the various proposals which have been putforward for dealing with the resulting situation, viz..  thepresent Arab plan, Zionist aspirations so far as we have beenable to ascertain them,  and our own proposals.      It wouldconclude by asking the General Assembly to consider our report and to recommend a settlement of the problem.      We do not propose that,  in submitting the matter to the Assembly,His Majestyls Government  should themselves make any recommendation.1h. The substance of  the British proposals has alreadybecome public knowledge and the Palestine Conference willprobably come  to an end this week.      In these circumstances,it will be necessary to make an announcement in Parliamentearly next week,  and. this will be followed by a. request for adabate, facilities for which will probably have to be givenlat^r in the week.We propose that a White paper should be published in advance of the debate,  containing (a)  the provincial autonomy plan,  as described by the Lord President in theHouse of Commons on 31st July,  19u7 (together with the mapwhich accompanied the Report of the British and Americanofficials, on which the Lord president&apos;s statement was based);(b) the proposals made by the arab Delegations in September1946,  and  (c)  the latest British proposals.E.B.13th February,  1 9^-17*
