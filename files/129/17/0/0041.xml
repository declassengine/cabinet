J0 Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1947DOCUMENT   IS   THE  PROPERTY  OP   HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GSECRETNCP. (47) 91lAth March, 1947J.A3INETNEW ZEALAND AND THE  STATUTE  OF WESTMINSTERMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs have recently been informed that the New Zealand Government may before long wish to take steps for the application to New Zealand of the Statute of westminster.2. Section 10 of the Statute of Westminster provided that sections 2 to 6would not extend to the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand or Newfound-land unless adopted by the Parliament of the Dominion concerned. This provision was inserted at the express request of the Dominions mentioned. Australiaadopted the sections of the Statute in 1942, but New Zealand despite considera-tion of the matter from time to time has not so far taken action. The existing restrictions on the powers of the New Zealand Parliament give rise to adminis-trative difficulty both for the United Kingdom and for New Zealand, especiallyin connection with the drafting of legislation, and it would be to the advantageof both countries if they could be removed.3. The New Zealand Government attach importance to adoption of thesesections by New Zealand being accompanied by a change in the United Kingdomlaw so as to give New Zealand full power to amend its own Constitution. Underthe New Zealand Constitution (Amendment) Act 1857 of the United Kingdom,the New Zealand Parliament can amend the Constitution except for some fifteensections which can only be amended by the United Kingdom Parliament.Adoption of the Statute of Westminster by New Zealand would not affect this position since section 8 of the Statute provides that, even if New Zealand adopted the Statute, the existing legal position as regards the amendment of the NewZealand Constitution would be unaffected.4.   Accordingly the New Zealand Government would like to be in a posi-tion, when introducing legislation adopting the Statute of Westminster, to statethat, if New Zealand should ask the United Kingdom for legislation givingNew Zealand complete power to amend its Constitution, the United KingdomGovernment would be prepared to introduce such legislation into Parliament.This seems to me a very reasonable request.   It is anomalous, in view of thepresent constitutional position, that amendment of any Dominion constitution should require legislation by the United Kingdom Parliament.   The Common-wealth of Australia and the Union of South Africa already have full power! to amend their Constitutions.   In the case of Canada any amendment of thej Constitution [i.e., the British North America Act of 1867) still requires legis-I lation by the United Kingdom Parliament, but experience, especially in recent&quot; years, has shown that it is inconvenient and embarrassing to the United KingdomPailiament that it should be called upon to pass legislation, purely of domestic concern to a Dominion, on the merits of which Parliament is in no position toform a proper judgment.5. No question arises of legislation in the United Kingdom this sessionsince the earliest date at which the New Zealand Government could introducetheir legislation would be July of this year and they would not expect the Unitedr33305]
Kingdom to legislate until their own legislation had been passed. Accordinglylegislation here would not be required before the 1947/48 session, and it might even be deferred until a later session, since it is not clear that the New zealand government would necessarily be ready to take action as early as July. Onlya two-clause Bill would in all probability be required and it should not be controversial.6. I should accordingly be glad to have authority to inform the NewZealand Government that they are at liberty to state, when introducing legis-lation for the adoption of sections 2 to 6 of the Statute of Westminster that, ifNew Zealand should ask the United Kingdom for legislation giving NewZealand complete power to amend its own Constitution, the United KingdomGovernment would be prepared to introduce such legislation into Parliament,here.A.Dominions Office, Downing Street, S. W. 1.14^ March, 1947.
