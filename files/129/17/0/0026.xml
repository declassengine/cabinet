DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET COPY NO.   P   /CP. (47) 764TH MARCH,   1947CABINETELECTRICITY SUPPLY NATIONALISATION bill note by Minister of transport in his paper (CP. (47) 73) the Minister of fuel and Power proposes that a global sum of  5 millions shouldbe made available by way of additional compensation tolocal authorities.If any concession is made on the Electricity Bill,it is clear that some corresponding concession must be madeon the Transport Bill,  and I would make the following comments:-1.      A global sum could not be given to local authorities by way of additional compensation for their transport undertakings,  since under the transport bill, municipal undertakings will be transferred(if transfer of ownership is necessary) underschemes made at various dates,2.      A concession of this character might well leadto a demand for a global addition to compensa-tion from railway and canal stock holders,unless  it were specifically related and limited by the terms of the Electricity Bill to compensation for severance and increasedproportion of overheads,   and-were covered byan appropriate formula which could be ofgeneral application, to local authoritiesdeprived of a trading undertaking.A.B.Ministry of Transport, W.1.4th March,  1947.
