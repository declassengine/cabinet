Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1947SECRETCopy No,CP. (47) S63rd March, 1947CABINETSOUTH PACIFIC   commission memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theSecretary of State for the ColoniesWE circulate for the information of our colleagues, as the Annex to this paper, the text of an Agreement recently drawn up at a Conference in Canberrafor the establishment of the South Pacific Commission.2. The South Pacific Commission is to be a body analogous to the carribbean Commission whose scope, as the Cabinet will be aware, was increased last year to include the French and Netherlands Governments as wellas the United Kingdom and United States Governments. The idea of estab-lishing a similar regional commission for the island territories of the SouthPacific was first advocated in Articles 28 to 31 of the Australia-New ZealandAgreement of January 1944 (Cmd. 6513). The proposal was welcomedin principle by the United Kingdom Government and was discussed duringthe Prime Ministers&apos; meeting in London in May 1946. It was then agreed thatthe Australian and New Zealand Governments would convene a Conference towhich the United Kingdom, United States, French and Netherlands Governments,as having territorial interests in the area, would also be invited; the conference would thus represent all the States with dependent territories in the South Pacific.3. Owing to the prior claims of other international meetings, it was notpossible to convene this Conference until the beginning of the present year. TheConference met in Canberra from the 28th January to 6th February, Dr. Evattof Australia being President and Mr. Nash of New Zealand Vice-President. TheUnited Kingdom was represented by Mr. Ivor Thomas, M.P., parliamentary under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, Mr. E. J. Williams, United kingdom high Commissioner in Canberra and Sir A. Grantham, K.C.M.G., Governor ofFiji and High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. The Conference completed its work in less than a fortnight in an atmosphere of great cordiality,, and at its conclusion drew up the Agreement annexed to this paper. The Agreement, whichis based in many respects on the Agreement establishing the Caribbean Commis-sion, was signed ad referendum by the representatives of the six Governmentsconcerned.4. As soon as examination of the text has been completed, it is proposedto signify acceptance of the Agreement on the part of the United KingdomGovernment. The Agreement will come into force when all the six Governmentsconcerned have signified their acceptance.5. The South Pacific Commission will cover all the island territories ofthe South Pacific lying south of the Equator and eastwards from the Dutch new guinea inclusive; that is to say, the principal territories included in its scopewill be Fiji (United Kingdom), Papua and New Guinea (Australia), Samoa (NewZealand and United States), New Caledonia (France) and Dutch New Guinea(Netherlands). The Japanese Pacific Islands (Carolines, Marshalls andMarianas) now in United States military occupation are not included.[33186]
6. The Commission is to be a consultative and advisory body to the oartici-pating Governments in matters affecting the economic and social development ofthe territories concerned and the welfare and advancement of their peoples(Article 4 of the Agreement). By general consent, it was agreed to exclude fromthe Commission\s scope political affairs and matters of defence and securityEach participating Government will be represented by two Commissioners. TheCommission is to meet twice a year and will publish an annual report on its activities. It is empowered to set up auxiliary and technical bodies, and theimportance of co-ordination in research work with a view to promoting economicand social development has been recognised by the agreement to establish research Council.7. As in the case of the Caribbean Commission, measures have been taken to associate the local inhabitants of the region with the Commission^ work. It hasbeen agreed to set up an auxiliary body called the South Pacific Conference(Articles 9-12 of the Agreement) to be convoked within two years of the entry into force of the Agreement and meeting thereafter at intervals not exceeding-three years. This Conference will advise the Commission and Delegates are to be selected in such a way as to ensure the greatest possible measure of representationof the inhabitants. It will not, of course, be possible to adopt a uniform scheme,since the level of advancement of the inhabitants of these territories varies widelyand some (such as those of New Guinea) are still very primitive.8. The Commission is to have no organic connection with the united nations, but it will co-operate as fully as possible with the United Nations andthe appropriate &quot; specialised agencies &quot; on matters of mutual concern (Article 15of the Agreement).9. Considerable discussion took place on the best location for the head-quarters of the Commission. The United Kingdom view, which was that thequarters should be located on one of the island territories within the region andnot in one of the metropolitan countries outside it, was accepted by the Conference,though with some reluctance on the part of the representatives of Australia, whowould have preferred to see the headquarters established in Sydney permanently.The final selection of the site is left to the Commission itself and in the meanwhiletemporary headquarters are to be established in or near Sydney (Article 16).10. As regards finance, it will be seen from Article 14 of the agreement that the expenses of the Commission are to be shared among the participating governments on a percentage basis. Australia assumes the largest share (30 percent.); the United Kingdom is to contribute 15 per cent., on an equality with NewZealand and the Netherlands; while France and the United States are tocontribute 12-1 per cent. each. Agreement was reached at the Conference toestablish an initial working fund of  40,000. In future it will be for the Corn-mission itself to draw up its budget and obtain the approval of the Governmentsconcerned through their representatives on the Commission.11. The work of the Canberra Conference can, we think, be regarded as agood example of co-operative effort between colonial Powers and we have everyhope that the South Pacific Commission, when it gets to work, will be ofconsiderable practical benefit in this region both in encouraging international co--operation and in co-ordinating measures for the advancement of theinhabitants. It is especially satisfactory that we have embarked on a measureof this kind in collaboration with two of the other Governments of the BritishCommonwealth, and the participation of the United States Government is alsoto be welcomed as likely to encourage a realistic and responsible attitude on their part towards colonial problems.A.A. C J.Dominions Office,Colonial Office,3rd &quot;March, 1947.
