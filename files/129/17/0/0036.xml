; 195 -(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S QOVERNMENSECRETCP, (47)  8618th March,   1947CABINETMID-WEEK SPORTING EVENTSMemorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary1. At their meeting on 4th March (F.C. (47)  10thMeeting, Minute 4) the Puol Committee invited the Secretaryof State for Scotland,  the Minister of Fuel and Power and myself to consult with representatives of the various formsof sport with a view to the limitation of   mid-week sportingevents.2. We held three meetings yesterday,  the first withrepresentatives  of the Association ana Rugby Footballorganisations,  the second with representatives of theNational Greyhound Racing Association,  the Licensed GreyhoundRacecourse Association,  the Autocycle Union and the British -Ice Hockey Association and the third with Stewards of theJockey Club and  the National Hunt Committee.3. We pointed out that in the present critical situation of the country it was essential that all possible steps should be&apos;taken to avoid interference with production,particularly during the coming months:    while the Governmentwas most reluctant to propose limitations of mid-week sportwhich would undoubtedly cause  inconvenience both to thespectators and the organisers of the various forms of sport,it was of vital importance that arrangements should be made whereby all sporting events which were likely to attractlarge attendances should take place on Saturday afternoonor evening only*    if such events were held on other daysthey would be bound to act  as an inducement to absenteeism,and in view of the efforts which were being made tointroduce the two shift system the effect of mid-week eventswould be equally bad whether the^r were held in the afternoonor the evening.      All these meetings were held in a friendlyatmosphere and the representatives of all the organisationsshowed a due appreciation of the seriousness of thesituation and a desire to co-operate,4. As regards football the representatives of thevarious organisations agreed to report the Governmentswishes to their Executives at the earliest possible opportunity and to submit proposals for a reorganisation ofthe remainder of this season&apos;s football programme whichwould eliminate all mid-week matches.      The Secretary of theFootball Association said that arrangements had already beenmade for a number of international matches between boysCOPY NO.
aged 17 and under in London during April.      These matcheswould be played during the week but would not bo likely to attract large crowds.      I said that  the Government would beprepared to consider whether these matches could be exempted from the ban.      A number of questions were asked about; thearrangements for next season to which I replied that the urgent matter was the need for the limitation of mid-weekevents during the remainder of the present season:    noundertaking could be given that similar arrangements wouldnot be necessary next season but there would be furtheropportunities for consultation about this.      We agreed thatmatches which had already been arranged for this week shouldbe allowed to stand,  but asked that all arrangements madefor raid-week matches next week should be cancelled.      To this the representatives of the Football League agreed.5. As regards greyhound racing the position is complicated by the fact that under the Betting and LotteriesAct,   1934,  racing may only take place on those two days  inthe week which have been fixed by the licensing authorities:in some cases these days do not include Saturday.      I saidthat the Government would be prepared to introduce legislation as soon as possible amending the Act  in such a way as toenable racing to take place at all tracks on Saturdays only.I expressed the hope that  such legislation, could be speedilysecured if it were not opposed by the Greyhound Racinginterests.      The Minister of Fuel and Power said that hewould be prepared,  in the meantime,  to relax the ban on theuse of electricity at greyhound racing tracks on Saturdaysonly;    this relaxation would not,  of itself, however,  enableany racing to take place at those tracks which were not nowlicensed, for Saturday racing.The greyhound racing representatives said that theywere prepared to agree to these proposals but pressed thatthe proposed legislation should permit  the holding of two meetings on Saturday,  one in the afternoon and one in the evening,      I promised that this request should besympathetically considered.      They also urged that legislation should be introduced with all possible speedin order to remedy the position of those tracks where racingon Saturday was at present illegal.6. As regards speedway racing, which takes place at night, the principal difficulty is that a large proportionof the meetings are held, at greyhound racing tracks and thatif two greyhound- racing meetings are held on Saturdays itwill not be practicable for speedway racing meetings to beheld.      It was argued that speedway racing differed from theother forms of sport under consideration In that it did notattract large numbers of industrial workers and was more inthe nature of a family entertainment such as the cinema.      Itwas pointed out that there was no betting at these meetings and that a large proportion of the spectators were women and young persons.      The attendances are however very considerable(at Wembley as high as 60,000)  and I said that the Governmentcoulrj not agree to the exemption of speedway racing from anygeneral ban on mid-week sports attracting large attendances.I asked the representatives of the Auto-cycle Union to consulturgently with the Greyhounl Racing Association with a view tosome arrangement being made by which the tracks should be madeavailable for weekly or fortnightly speedway meetings.
7. As regards j.ce hockey the attendances are small andin no way comparable wTTTTT attendances at the other forms ofsport concerned.      We agreed that restrictions on mid-weekice hockey were not at present called for.8. As regards horse racing I said that there was noquestion of asking for the complete abandonment of mid-weekmeetings.      The Government recognised the contribution whichthe blood-stock industry could, make to agriculture and towardssecuring foreign exchange and had no desire to&quot;impede the recovery of the industry from the set-back which it had sufferedas a result of the drastic restriction of racing during the war.The Government were however concerned, to ensure that bigmeetings attracting very large crowds should be held onSaturdays instead of during the week.      The Jockey Clubrepresentatives said that they were quite prepared to co-operate and would arrange &quot;for immediate consultations with theracecourse operators concerned,   some of whom  (e.g. Doncaster,Chester, York)  are local authorities.      ive agreed that it was now too late to alter the date of the Lincoln meeting,  which takes place in the last week in March,  but the representativesof the Jockey Club have undertaken to submit proposals to theMinister of &quot;Fuel and Power and myself for the rearrangement ofthe racing programme so as to provide that as many of theremaining big races as is possible should be held on Saturdays.As:regards:steeple-chasing the only event which attracts a really large crowd is the Grand National and. the representativesof the national Hunt Committee agreed that the date    of thismeeting should be altered from Friday 23th March,  to Saturday2 9th march.9. Provided that the Football Association and the Jockey .Club submit satisfactory proposals it is the view of mycolleagues and myself that the arrangements for limitingmid-week, sport which can be secured by voluntary co-operationcan be regarded as sufficient and that it would not be desirableto introduce legislation imposing any more drastic restrictionson mid-week sport.      Legislation will however be necessary toenable greyhound racing to take ploCu at all tracks on Saturdayand to limit it 10 that day and we ask for anthor1ty for its immediate introduction.      Whether one or two meetings should be permitted is 0 matter for consideration,  but in view of the factthat the present law allows racing on 101. days in the year plush Bank holidays,  my colleagues and. I incline to the view thatit would be reasonable to permit two meetings.      Wc also proposethat,  pending the introduction of legislation,  the existing banon the use of electricity at greyhound,, tracks should be removed in so far as racing on Saturdays is concerned.10. There remains for consideration the question whetherconsultations should now take place with representative-, ofother forms of sport  (e. g.  cricket,  lawn tennis and. coursing)whose limitation was not considered by the Fuel Committee attheir meeting on hth March.      The question whether cricket woulabe restricted was put to me both by the football representation /osand by the -Jockey Club, who pointed out that the attendance, ata four day Test Match at Nottingham was likely to be nearly double the attendance st 10 days of racing at Nottingham.      Ifthere is any question of asking the M.C.C.   to propose that theSouth African tour should be cancelled,  very early action willbe required,  as the team is due to sail on 3rd April.      If,however,  the tour takes place there will have to be play on a -
large number of mid-week days,  and the Test Matches are likelyto draw large crowds.      Similarly if the County CricketChampionship is to take place at all, mid-week play is unavoidable.      Cricket does not normally attract anything likethe same crowds as football or greyhound racing,   nor is itplayed to any great extent in the mining areas of Tyneside,South Wales or Scotland.      If we ask the M.C.C.   to agree to a-general limitation of mid-week games this would, amount to the virtual abandonment of the first-class cricket season,  ana the cancellation of the South African tour at this late stage,while the Royal Family are still in South Africa, might have an unfortunate effect in the Dominion.      Before consulting theM.CC.  as to the measures which might be taken to minimise the interference which may be caused by professional cricketto production,  I should be glad to have the guidance of mycolleagues.11. I think that it would also be as well to consult theLawn Tennis Association about the possibility of making somealterations in the Wimbledon Championship.      It does notappear necessary that we should concern ourselves with amateurathletics, boxing (professional or amateur), field or aquaticsports,  none of which attract large crowds.      As to coursing,the only event which attracts a large crowd is the WaterlooCup.      This is due to be held in the very near future and itis doubtful whether it is practicable to ask at this datethat it should, be cancelled.J. C. EHome Office,  S.W.1.,.   12th March,  1SU7-
