(Revise)20th March, 1947CABINETEXPANSION OF FUEL AND POWER RESOURCESMemorandum by the Prime minister in deciding between competing demands on available resources of labourand materials, we must for a time give precedence to projects which will increase our supplies of coal, gas and electricity. Recent events have shown that, unlessour resources of fuel and power can be expanded, the whole tempo of our economy will be gravely retarded.Allocating authorities for labour, materials and other essential supplies(including building and civil engineering work) should therefore go as far as is practicable to meet all necessary requirements for the manufacture, installationand repair of the equipment listed below : (i) Electricity generating plant required by electricity undertakings,(ii) Machinery and. equipment for deep-mined and opencast coal production.(iii) Plant and equipment required by gas undertakings.(iv) Equipment for the coal/oil conversion programme.(v) Freight locomotives, railway wagons for the transport of coal, and steelrails for essential maintenance of the permanent way.This Directive was approved by the Cabinet on 18th March, 1947 (CM. (47)29th Conclusions, Minute 5). I ask my colleagues to make a special point of seeing that it is brought to the notice of all concerned in their Departments.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S. W. 1,20th March, 1947.[33344]
