(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (47)  56 COPY NO.10th February,  1947CABINETTHE FUTURE OF Cyprus memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsR e c omme nd a t i o ns(l)      That the Chiefs of Staff should be invited toexamine the effect on our position in the Mediterranean ofour ultimately relinquishing Cyprus and to estimate whatrights and facilities we should require for strategicalreasons to retain if it were decided to cede the sovereignty of the island to Greece under a Treaty granting us a privileged position there.(S)     That no statement should be made in presentcircumstances either by His Majesty&apos;s Government or by theGovernor of Cyprus regarding the future status of the island.C o ns i d e r a t i o nsFor many years past there has been a presistentdemand both in Cyprus itself and also in Greece in favour ofthe union of the island with Greece.      Since the liberation of Greece the demand has revived but at our request successivefriendly Greek Governments have damped down this agitation asfar as it lay within their power to do so.   - Meanwhile, theGovernment of Cyprus on the authority of the Cabinet announcedlast Autumn a ten years&apos; &apos;development plan for the island, ata cost of  6,000,000 and the setting up of a consultative assembly for the purpose of restoring a measure of self-government to the inhabitants.      But the Party in favour of union with Greece, representing probably 70% of the population,proposes to boycott the assembly in order to demonstrate that nothing but union with Greece will satisfy them.It has been suggested to meet this situation thatthe newly appointed Governor should,  on taking up his post,be authorised to announce that in no circumstances willBritish sovereignty over the island, be abandoned;    or,  asan alternative,  that he should state that while maintaining the status quo for ten years His Majesty&apos;s Government willbe prepared at  the end 1 of this period to discuss with theCypriot people and the Greek Government the&apos; future of the island in the spirit of Article 73 of the United nations charter.
50I am opposed to both these courses, because:-(1)    In both cases we should by our action stir updiscussion and agitation, at a time when we havequite enough on. our hands as it is in Greece andthe Middle East,  whereas if we let sleeping dogslie. we may hope to be able to postpone this difficult problem for a further period duringwhich we may be able to work out some satisfactory solution.(2)    After the line we have taken over the Sudan, wecould not possibly maintain that the Cypriotpeople shall never have the right to decide theirown future status-    and. after having more or lessforced the French to grant independence to Syriaand the Lebanon,  we cannot assert that theCypriots are so much more backward than theSyrians and  the Lebanese,  that they must waitanother ten years before they are ripe for s e 1 f - d e t e r m itiati o n.(3)    If we now raise the issue by means of a public statement the Greek and Cypriot people will consider  this as a challenge and the GreekGovernment will he forced to declare themselvesin favour of Immediate and unconditional union,for If they kept silent they would,  even at  thecost of offending His Majesty13 Government, beoutbidden by the Communists.I hope,  therefore,  that we shall not precipitatematters by premature action;    but that instead we should set to work to consider whether, while we have still got a !friendly Greek Government to deal with,  we could not come tosome arrangement whereby in return for surrendering oursovereignty we could not receive such rights  and facilities in the island as may be considered, necessary to us on strategic grounds.It must be borne in. mind, that if an unfriendlyGovernment were ever established, in Greece,  they would beincited &quot;by the Soviet Government to stir up a violentagitation in favour of union with Cyprus;    that it would bevery difficult for us to resist such a campaign indefinitelyand that if and when we eventually had to give way to it, weshould have to  do so without any prospect of being able to preserve such rights and facilities In the island which weshould certainly be able to obtain from the present friendlyGreek G ov e r ran e nt.Whatever is decided I would propose in the firstinstance that the Chiefs of Staff should he asked to reporton the strategic aspects of the question as set forth in this paper.E.B.Foreign Office,  S..W..;1;10th February,   1947.
