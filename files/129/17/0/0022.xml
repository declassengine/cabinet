INTERNATIONAL LABOUR conference i. At its 29th Session the International Labour Conference adopted ongth October, 1946, the Constitution of the International Labour OrganisationInstrument of Amendment, 1946,&apos;and the Final Articles Revision Convention,1946. The English texts of this Instrument and of the Convention are set out as appendices to this Paper.The  Constitution  of the  International  Labour  Organisation  Instrument  of amendment, 1946.2. The Instrument of Amendment embodies an almost complete revisionof the Constitution, resulting from discussions extending over two and a half years. The 27th Session of the International Labour Conference, held at Parisin October-November, 1945, adopted an Instrument of Amendment dealing with certain matters which in view of the prospective winding up of the Leagueof Nations were specially urgent, and, in addition, appointed a ConferenceDelegation on Constitutional Questions with a comprehensive mandate to review all outstanding questions relating to the Constitution and constitutional practice of the International Labour Organisation.3. The Delegation was composed of six representatives of Governments(the United Kingdom, the United States, of America, China, Cuba, France, andthe Union of South Africa) ; three representatives of Employers (Sir JohnForbes Watson, Director of the British Emplojfers&apos; Confederation, UnitedKingdom, Mr. P. YValine, France, and Mr. F. Yllanes Ramos, Mexico) ; andthree Workers&apos; representatives (Mr. (now Sir) Joseph Halisworth, Member ofthe Trades Union Congress General Council, United Kingdom, Mr. LeonJouhaux, France, and Mr. Robert J. Watt, United States of America). TheUnited Kingdom Government representative (Mr. (now Sir) GuildhaunieMyrddin-Evans, Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Labour and National Service,and Chairman of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office) waschosen as Chairman of the Delegation.4. In regard to all essential matters, the Instrument of Amendment isbased on the proposals of the Conference Delegation.5. The text of the Constitution as now amended by the Conference at Montrealis set out in the second column of the Annex to the Instrument, the actualamendments of the Constitution as in force on the 9th October, 1946, being shown by underlining. The principal amendments are broadly summarised inthe following paragraphs.6. The Declaration of Philadelphia. Article 1 of the Constitution is amended by the addition of a reference to the Declaration concerning the aims and purposes of the Organisation adopted at Philadelphia on 10th May, 1944, andthe text of the Declaration is annexed to and thus becomes part of theConstitution.7. Dissolution of the League of Nations. There Is a series of amendmentsconsequential upon the dissolution of the League of Nations. These amendment!;are complementary to the amendments to the articles of the Constitutiondealing with membership, finance and the procedure for future amendments which were &quot;adopted try the 27th Session of the International Labour Conferenceand which entered into force on 26th September, 1946. Their general effect is to delete any reference to the League of Nations and to transfer to the Inter-national Labour Conference, the Governing Body and the Director-Generalof the International Labour Office as appropriate, duties previously performed by the Council of the League of Nations and the Secretary-General of the Leagueof Nations. The choice of the seat of the International Labour Office is to be
decided by the Conference (Article 6). References to the Permanent Court ofInternational Justice are replaced by references to the International Court ofJustice (Articles 29 and 31 to 34). The amendments also involve the abrogationof certain transitory provisions dealing with the arrangements for the 1919Session of the International Labour Conference and arrangements prior to theconstitution of the League of Nations and the creation of the Permanent Courtof International Justice. In addition, Article 41 containing a statement ofcertain methods and principles for regulating &quot;labour conditions which were regarded in 1919 as being of special and urgent importance is now deleted asbeing out of elate or otherwise covered.8. Co-operation with the United Nations. There is a number of amendmentsdesigned to facilitate co-operation between the International Labour Organisa-tion and the United Nations. The most important is in Article 12 (1). Othersoccur in Articles 12 (2), 13 (1), 14 (1) and 19 (4).9. The Governing Body. A number of amendments have been introduced in order to clarify the existing constitutional position by recognising the established position of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office.Thus Article 2 now specifically cites the Governing Body as one of theconstituent parts of the Organisation. Other amendments deal with specificfunctions of the Governing Body (Articles 9 (1), 10 (1) and (2) ).10. Tripartite Character. Amendments are incorporated in the textregarding the choice of Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the Governing body and President and Vice-Presidents of the Conference (Articles 7 (7) and 17 (1) ).These are designed to emphasize the tripartite character of the Organisation.11. Staff of the International Labour Office. The title of the Director of theInternational Labour Office is changed to that of Director-General. Inaddition there are included in the Constitution provisions emphasizing theinternational character of the staff of the Office as well as an undertaking bythe Members of the Organisation to respect that &quot; exclusively international character &quot;.   (Articles 9 (4) and (5) ).12. Assistance to Governments. The amended text provides that &quot; subjectto such directions as the Governing Body may give, the Office shall accord to governments at their request all appropriate assistance within its power inconnection with the framing of laws and regulations on the basis of thedecisions of the Conference and the improvement of administrative practices and systems of inspection &quot;.   (Article 10 (2) (&amp;) ).13. Consultation with non-governmental international organisations. provision is included for the International Labour Organisation to &quot; make suitable arrangements for such consultation as it may think desirable with recognisednqn-goyernrnental international organisations, including international organisa-tious of employers, workers, agriculturists and co-operators &quot;.   (Article 12 (3) ).14. Suspension of voting privileges. As amended by the 27th Session of theinternational Labour Conference the Constitution provided that Members ofthe Organisation which are two years in arrears in the payment of their financial contributions to the Organisation could not vote unless the Conferencewaived the suspension. As now amended the Constitution provides that a two-thirds majority of the Conference is required for waiving the suspension.(Article 13 (4) ). i15. Consideration of subjects before the Conference. Provision is made inthe amended text for the Governing Body to make rules to ensure thoroughpreparation and adequate consultation of the Members primarily concernedprior to the adoption of a Convention or Recommendation by the Conference.(Article 14 (2) ). With the same object in view the Governing Body is alsoempowered to make rides to ensure that the reports on items on the agenda55392 a 2
are despatched in time to permit of adequate consideration before meetingsof the Conference.   (Article 15 (2) ).16. Action on Conventions and Recommendations. The revised text containsin Article 19 a number of important amendments to the provisions of theConstitution defining the obligations of Members of the Organisation in respectof Conventions and Recommendations. New obligations are imposed on members, providing for the submission of more comprehensive reports than hitherto ; these reports will deal with the measures taken by Members tobring Conventions and Recommendations before the National competent authorities, with the reasons why Conventions have not been ratified, withthe extent to which unratified Conventions have in fact been applied or willbe applied, with the application of Recommendations and with the provisionsof the law and practice of Members in relation to the matters dealt with inthe Conventions and Recommendations. It is hoped that the obligation tomake reports of this nature will stimulate Member States to ratify and applyConventions and to carry out the provisions of Recommendations to a greater extent than they have done hitherto. . The amended text also clarifies theposition and strengthens the obligations of federal States in these matters.It is further provided in Article 23 that summaries of the reports to besubmitted in accordance with the new obligations shall be laid before theConference. Other amendments clarify existing provisions. Thus Recom-mendations are described as designed &quot; to meet circumstances where thesubject, or aspect of it, dealt with is not considered suitable or appropriate atthat time for a Convention &quot;, (Article 19 (1) ), and paragraph 8 of Article 19lays clown categorically that the provisions of a Convention or Recommendationmust in no circumstances be deemed to prejudice more favourable conditionsalready enjoyed by workers. The term &quot; Convention &quot; is substituted for the term &quot; Draft Convention &quot; the latter has frequently led to misunderstandingand has tended to obscure the binding character of the obligations resultingfrom the ratification of Conventions.17. Economic Sanctions. The references in the existing Constitution to continue sanctions in the case of Members failing to carry out the recom-mendations of a Committee of Enquiry or the Permanent Court are omittedand Article 33 provides that in the event of any Member failing to carry outthe recommendations of a Committee of Enquiry or the International court the Governing Body may recommend to the Conference such action as it may deem wise and expedient to secure compliance therewith.18. Interpretation of the Constitution and of Conventions. Article 37 (1)provides for the submission to the International Court of Justice of disputeson the interpretation of the Constitution or of any Convention concluded inaccordance with its provisions. As an alternative procedure applying toConventions, Article 37 (2) provides for the appointment in cases of urgency of a tribunal to determine any dispute or question relating to the interpretation of a Convention.19. Regional Conferences. Article 38 makes explicit the authority of theOrganisation to call regional, conferences and to establish regional agencies.20. Non-Metropolitan Territories. By Article 3 (3) authority is given foreach Member responsible for the international relations of non-metropolitan territories to appoint as additional advisers to each of its delegates (a) persons nominated by it as representatives of any such territory in regard to matters within the self-governing powers of that territor3&apos; and (h) persons nominated by it to advise its delegates in regard to matters concerning non-self-governingterritories. The object of this provision is to permit more adequate representa-tion for non-metropolitan territories at Sessions of the Conference. Inaddition, Article 35 contains more detailed provisions designed to improve theprocedure for the application of Conventions to non-metropolitan territories.
21. Legal Status and Immunities of the Organisation. Articles 39 and 40deal with the legal status of the Organisation and the privileges and immunitiesof the Organisation, the delegates to the Conference, members of the governing body and the Director-General and officials of the Office. The privileges and immunities are to be defined in a separate agreement between the member states.22. Entry into force. In accordance with Article 36 of the Constitution the instrument of Amendment will take effect when ratified or accepted by two-thirds of the Members of the Organisation including five of the eight members which are represented on the Governing Body as Members of chief industrialimportance. These eight States at present are : United States of America,United Kingdom, France, Canada, India, Holland, Belgium and China.The Final Articles Revision Convention, 1946 (Convention No..80).23. This Convention is consequential on the dissolution of the League ofNations and the procedural amendments of the Constitution as contained inthe Instrument of Amendment, 1946. It makes amendments in the texts ofthe Conventions adopted by the Organisation in the past for the purpose of bringing them into line with the new procedure.Proposed Action. -24.

But, holding as they do that labour should not be regardedmerely as an article of commerce, they think that there are methods and principles for regulating labour conditions which all. industrial communities should endeavour to apply,so far as their special circumstances will permit.Among these methods and principles, the following seem to the High ContractingParties to be of special and urgent importance :First. The guiding principle above enunciated that labour should not be regardedmerely as a commodity or article of commerce.Second. The right of associating for all lawful purposes by the employed as well as bythe employers.Third. The payment to the employed of a wage adequate to maintain a reasonable standard of life as this is understood in their time and country.Fourth. The adoption of an eight hours day or a forty-eight week as the standard tobe aimed at where it has not already been attained.Fifth. The adoption of a weekly rest of at least twenty-four hours, which should includeSunday wherever practicable.Sixth. The abolition of child labour and the imposition of such limitations on thelabour of young persons as shall -permit the continuation of their education and assuretheir proper jmysical development.Seventh. The principle that men and women should receive equal remuneration forwork of equal value.JCighth. The standard set by law in each country with respect to the conditions oflabour should have due regard to the equitable economic treatment of all workers law-fully resident therein.
Ninth. Each State should make provision for a system of inspection in which women should take part, in order to ensure the enforcement of the laws and regulations for the&apos;protection of the employed.Without claiming that these methods and principles arc either complete or final, theHigh Contracting Parties are of opinion that they are well fitted to guide the policy of theLeague of Nations ; and that, if adopted by the industrial communities who are Membersof the League, and safeguarded in practice by an adequate syTstem of such inspection,they will confer lasting benefits upon the wage earners of the world.the foregoing is the authentic text of the Constitution of the International LabourOrganisation Instrument of Amendment, tg.16, duly adopted by the General Conferenceof the International Labour Organisation on the ninth day of October one thousand nine hundred and forty-six in the course of its Twenty-ninth Session, which was held at Montreal.The English and French versions of the text of this Instrument of Amendment are-equally authoritative.IN FAITH WHEREOF we have appended our signatures this first day of November,The President of the Conference,HUMPHREY MITCHELL.The Director-General of the International Labour Office,EDWARD PHELAN.APPENDIX II.INTERNATIONAL LABOUR conference convention (No. 80) FOR THE PAK.TIAL REVISION OF THE GONVEN-TIONS ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNA-TIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION AT ITS FIRST TWENTY-EIGHTSESSIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING PROVISION FOR THEFUTURE DISCHARGE OF CERTAIN CHANCERY FUNCTIONS ENTRUST-ED BY THE SAID CONVENTIONS TO THE SECRETARY-GENERAL OFTHE LEAGUE OF NATIONS AND INTRODUCING THEREIN certain further AMENDMENTS CONSEQUENTIAL UPON THE dissolution of THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS AND THE AMENDMENT OF THE CON-STITUTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION.The General Conference of the International Labour Organisation,Having been convened at Montreal by the Governing Body of the International LabourOffice, and having met in its Twenty-ninth Session on 19 September 1946, andHaving decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to the partialrevision ol the Conventions adopted by the Conference at its first twenty-eight sessionsfor the purpose of making provision for the future discharge of certain chanceryfunctions entrusted by the said Conventions to the Secretary-General of the Leagueof Nations and introducing therein certain further amendments consequential uponthe dissolution of the League of.Nations and the amendment of the Constitution ofthe International Labour Organisation, a question which is included in the seconditem on the agenda of the Session, and considering that these proposals must take the form of an international Convention,adopts this ninth day of October of the year one thousand nine hundred and forty-six thefollowing Convention which may lie cited as the Final Articles Revision Convention, 194(1 :Article 11.
