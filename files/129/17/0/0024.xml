Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1947SECRET Copy &quot;-Wo.CP. (47) 7428th February, 1947CABINETELECTORAL legislation memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary ofState for scotland the Report of the Committee on Electoral Registration has now been published (Cmd. 7004) and a summary of its recommendations is contained in annex I. We are in general agreement with the unanimous recommendations ofthe Committee, and we think that, subject to any modifications necessitated bydecisions on other matters to which we refer later in this memorandum, theyshould be given effect in legislation to be introduced next session. The life of thepresent Parliament expires in August 1950, and it seems desirable that the new system of registration should be operating with full efficiency by the autumn of1949. To this end it would be desirable to bring it into force for the SpringRegister of 1949; and, if this is to be done, the necessary legislation must be onthe Statute Book during the 1947-48 session so as to give time for regulations tobe made and a canvass which would take place in the autumn of 1948 to be organised.2. There are three reservations to the Committee&apos;s Report, of which the firstat least raises political questions; and these reservations will have to be examined in detail.3. Apart from the Electoral Registration Report, there are other matters concerning electoral procedure and practice upon which decisions are, or soonwill be, required.  These are (a) The outstanding recommendations of the Speakers Conference (Cmds.6534 and 6543) and the recommendations contained in the InterimReport of the Committee on Electoral Law Reform (Cmd. 6606).These recommendations, which have never been considered by thepresent Government, are summarised in Annex II. We have also indicated in that Annex the provisional views of the Coalition Govern-ment on such of these matters as were considered by the Cabinet.(b) The Committee on Electoral Law Reform is expected shortly to submitits final report; and its recommendations which will deal with matters of detail with regard to electoral procedure and voting ,might be given effect (unless tihe technical difficulties are insuperable)in any legislation introduced next session.(c) The university and business premises franchises.-^Consideration should no doubt be given to the case for continuing these, and it is important that a decision on this matter should be reached before detailed work is begun on the preparation of legislation relating to registration andelection law.(d) Date of local elections: If the recommendation that there should bespring and autumn registers is accepted, the question will arise of altering the date of the English borough council elections and of all local elections in Scotland from November and December to the spring.There is considerable support for this change of date in England andWales; and, while the matter is more controversial in Scotland, thereis probably a majority among Scottish local authorities in favour ofthe change.[33226] b
4. In view of the many and varied matters awaiting decision, and of then-complex and, in some cases, political character, it seems appropriate that the fieldshould be surveyed and initial decisions reached by a Cabinet Committee. we accordingly recommend that a committee should be constituted fer this purpose and invited to make recommendations as to the form and scope of prospectiveelectoral legislation, including legislation arising out of the final report-whenit is available-of the Committee on Electoral Law Reform.    In view of the%8th February, 1947.J. C. E.J.

ANNEX other Recommendations awaiting DecisionNote. Jtems marked * were accepted by the Coalition Government. Theitem marked t was rejected. No decision was reached on the remainingitems.1.* University Representation. (Resolution 26 of the Interim Report ofthe Speaker&apos;s Conference.)Every person who has received or receives a Degree (or its equivalent) shallbe automatically registered and no fees shall be chargeable for registrationexpenses.Representations have been received as to the desirability of brino-inp- the postal voting arrangements at Universities into line with the ordinary arrange-ments for absent voting and which ensure the secrecy of the ballot. The existing arrangements for University postal voting do not ensure secrecy.2. Legal maximum scale of candidates expenses. (Resolution 1 of the final report of the Speaker&apos;s Conference.)It was proposed that the legal maximum of expenses should be a basic figureof  450 with an additional allowance of \hd. for each elector in a countyconstituency and a Id. for each elector in a borough constituency.3. Agents&apos; Fees. (Resolution 2 of the Final Report of the speakers conference.)It was proposed that the whole of the fees payable to agents should beincluded in the legal permitted maximum of election expenses. This point was further considered in informal discussions with members of the Speaker&apos;s Con-ference and Party Agents and there was general agreement in favour of thisrecommendation.4. Expenses incurred by unauthorised persons. (Resolution 3 of the final report and paragraph 20 of the Interim Report of the Committee on electoral law Reform.)The Speaker&apos;s Conference recommended amendment of Section 34 of the representation of the People Act, 1918, so that the prohibition on an unauthorisedperson incurring election expenses would not be limited to expenses incurred by holding meetings or issuing advertisements, circulars and publications for thepurpose of promoting a candidature. The Committee on Electoral Law Reformmade detailed suggestions as to how this recommendation could be effected, and suggested that the proposed provisions could also be applied to local government elections, but they did not examine the question of extending the provisions ofthe Act of 1918 to local government elections.5.* Issue of poll cards by Rettiminng Officer. (Resolution 4 of final report of the Speaker&apos;s Conference.)Poll cards to be issued to electors by the Returning Officer at public cost.6. Speakers&apos; Expenses. (Resolution 5 of the Final Report of the Speaker^Conference and paragraph 24 of Interim Report of the Committee on electoral law Reform.)The Speaker&apos;s Conference recommended the payment of speakers&apos; expenses,such expenses being included in the candidate^ return of expenses. The Cqm-mittee on Electoral Law Reform considered that, if in order to prevent evasionof the law, payments to speakers are authorised expenditure, they should beincluded under a separate heading in the election return of expenses, but not all members of that Committee were agreed as to the desirability of coming to any decision on this point pending the general review of the law of corrupt and illegalpractices on which the Committee will make its final report.7. Relief in respect of venial errors. (Resolution 6 of the Final Reportof the Speaker&apos;s Conference and paragraph 25 of the Interim Report of the CarrCommittee.)The Speaker&apos;a Conference recommended that relief in respect of inadvertentor venial errors in returns of expenses should be sought through a County Court,with a corresponding provision being effective in respect of Scotland. TheCommittee on Electoral Law Reform while admitting the practicability of the speakers Conference recommendation, preferred that the jurisdiction of theHigh Court should not be completely ousted and suggested that in respect ofthe venial errors listed in paragraph 26 of their Interim Report, relief shouldbe available from the Acting Returning Officers rather than the County Courtin England, and from the Returning Officers in Scotland subject to a right ofappeal to the High Court and the Court of Session respectively.
8 Use of schools and halls for election meetings. (Resolution 7 of theFinal&apos;Report of the Speaker&apos;s Conference and paragraph 19 of the InterimReport of the Committee on Electoral Law Reform.)(i) That halls normally used for letting and maintained from public funds should be made available for engagement by candidates at reasonabletimes, subject to any bona fide contract previously entered into bythe authority controlling the hall,(ii) A candidate should be able to get from the returning officer a listof schools and halls available for use in his constituency, and inthe case of schools the local Education Authorities should book themfor him.(iii) The statutory use of schools or halls should be at reasonable timesduring a period not exceeding three weeks before polling day.(iv) The prescribed maximum charges both for schools and for halls should,in addition to covering the actual cost of lighting, cleaning andheating, include an item to cover the cost of the hire of caretakersin the case of schools, and of the usual attendants in the case ofhalls.9 * Forfeiture of Deposit. (Resolutions 10 and 11 of the Final Reportof the Speakers Conference.)Where there are more than three candidates (or, in the case of a doublemember constituency, more than six candidates the deposit should be returnedif a candidate polls&quot; 1/10th of the total votes cast. Adjustment should be madein the provisions with regard to forfeiture of the deposit in the case of Universityconstituencies.10.* Acceptance of deposit by Returning Officer.

Increased polling facilities in Rural Areas. (Resolution 14 of the final report of the Speakers Conference and paragraphs 34-48 of the Interim Reportof the Committee on Electoral Law Reform.)It is recommended that increased polling facilities be provided under theexisting law by administrative action but that certain minor subsidiary pointsmight with advantage be covered by legislation.13.t Hours of polling.

Prohibition of broadcasting from a foreign station. (Resolution 18 ofthe Final Report of the Speaker&apos;s Conference and paragraphs 29-33 of the interim Report of the Committee on Electoral Law Reform.)The Speaker &apos;s Conference recommended that it should be made an offencefor any British subject to promote or to aid in promoting any broadcast affecting-Parliamentary elections from wireless stations outside the United Kingdom. TheCommittee on Electoral Law Reform pointed out that there would be a numberof difficulties in formulating and enforcing a wide prohibition of this kind and recommended that if legislation were to be undertaken the most appropriate method would be to make it an offence for .(i) any British subject to broadcast from a foreign station any matter with intent to influence the manner in which persons in this country shallvote at any election (Parliamentary or local government);(ii) any person (whether British subject or alien) or any organisation in thiscountry to procure or attempt to procure any person abroad to use a foreign station for such a purpose.
