THIS DOCUMENT  IS  TH3  PROPERTY OF  HIS  BRITiiNNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S&apos; GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1947 1 ll 4SECRET. Copy No.   &apos;w &quot;CP. (47) 6722r^ February, 1947CABINETSHIPPING FOR MIGRANTS  TO AUSTRALIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, and&apos; theMinister of Labour and National service the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, in a recent tele-gram to the Prime Minister (Annex I) has referred to the difficulties at present being experienced in the provision of shipping for migrants from this countryto Australia.2. As a result of the discussion by the Cabinet on the 11th October, 1945(CM. (45) 40th Conclusions 3), the 27th November, 1945 (CM. (45) 56th Con-elusions 4), and the 3rd January, 1946 (CM. (46) 2nd Conclusions 6), two agree-rnents between the United Kingdom Government and the commonwealth government were signed on the 5th March, 1946. These provided respectivelyfor (a) the grant of free passages at the cost of United Kingdom funds to menand women who served in the armed forces or merchant navy of the UnitedKingdom during the war and their dependants; (fc) a scheme for passageassistance to other approved migrants and their dependants. Under thisscheme the migrant would be required to contribute only  10 towards the costof passage and the remainder would be shared equally by the United Kingdomand Commonwealth Governments. It was made clear at the time that these schemes could not come into force until a date agreed upon by the UnitedKingdom and Commonwealth Governments, and that in view of the shortageof shipping, the date was unlikely to be before the end of 1946. The scheme shave not in fact yet been brought into force, and the only assisted movementof migrants to Australia which is taking place is one of 600 men employed inthe building industry who were urgently required in Australia. All themigrants are single ex-Service men, and it has been made clear that this wasa special movement and was not to be regarded as the initiation of the aboveschemes.3. The Commonwealth Prime Minister in his telegram urges that during1847 shipping should be made available for the carriage of 25,000 migrants toAustralia. Discussions which have been proceeding between officials of AustraliaHouse and the Ministry of Transport show that the maximum number of passageswhich, as at present foreseen, could be avail^isje durino; the year would be about,500, rising to 10,000 in 1948. This falls far short&quot; of the figure desired by australia. The Prime Minister in his reply to Mr^Chifley (Annex II) has undertaken that existing plans would be further examined in...the hope thatat any rate some increase in the number of migrant passages above^the presentestimate may be found possible.4. We are in agreement that the right policy for the United KingdomGovernment in this question of migration is to do all that is practicable toassist Australia (and any other Dominion) to build up their population as quickly as possible and to do so from British stock. Our own immediate man-power difficulties should not, in our view, be allowed to deflect us from thismajor object of British Commonwealth policy. A figure of 25,000 a year oreven more is not a significant one if taken as a general cross-section of thepopulation and is outweighed by the overriding importance of a better distribu-tion of population within the&apos; British Commonwealth on Defence and other[331851
grounds. We propose to agree to both the schemes mentioned in paragraph 2coming into force at an early date, probably 31st March, for such categories of intending settlers as the Australian Government may wish to receive, havingregard to the shipping available, subject only to a suitable measure of priority to ex-Service men and to the recommendation that the settlers selected shouldnot include an undue proportion of workers in particular occupations or craftswhose services are urgently needed here at the present time.5. It is necessary to consider in the light of the above what steps can betaken as regards the shipping position. As a result of consultations between theMinistry of Transport and Australia House the only possibilities of providingmore passages in British ships for migrants to Australia are : (a) the utilisation of three ships at present employed as troopers which could possibly be released for emigrants at intervals during the summer, viz., the Ranchi and Chitral(P. and O.) and the Ormonde (Orient). The first two of these will be required fortrooping again in two years&apos; time. The ships would require some refitting foremigrants, which will take time, but if the estimates of date of release and repairtime can be realised, the ships would be available to give some lift during 1947.The effect would be to raise the total provision of emigrants for 1947 to 6,900 andin 1948 to 15,500. Although Australia House is willing to accept an austerestandard of accommodation for emigrants on these ships, the total cost of refittingthe three could not be much less than  200,000. (&amp;) The use of the Aguitania,which is due for release from present service in April. Although this ship willbe exceptionally expensive to operate for emigrants, the Australian Governmenthave already announced that they are arranging with the owners to make heravailable for a two-year period. Not much refitting would be necessary foremigrants, so that the Aquitania might make three voyages in 1947. She willtake about 2,000 migrants per voyage and her use would bring the provision for1947 to over 12,000, and in 1948 to about 24,000. Apart from these British ships the only additional provision that could be made would be by the chartering or1purchase of suitable vessels under foreign flags; but the shortage of passengervessels is world-wide, and the demand for them very pressing on all routes, sothat, even if some speculative foreign owner without commitments to his own government could be attracted to offer tonnage, the cost would probably beextortionate. The possibility of purchasing a suitable United States ship,e.g., an ex-trooper, will be explored, but even if any suitable ship can be found itwould require very extensive reconversion and wouid be very expensive in dollars.6. Under the Agreement made with Australia, the Australian share of thepassage cost is limited to half the cost of the non-ex-service migrant (apart from 10 paid by the migrant himself), while the United Kingdom bears the full costof passage for the ex-service migrant and his dependants. A fare based on theeconomic cost of transporting these settlers to Australia would be about  70 inthe case of regular liners and it is reasonable to expect that Ranchi and Chitralcan operate on this fare. The third trooper, the Ormonde, is an older ship andsome of her freight capacity will have to be sacrificed to increase her passengercapacity. All three ships will suffer from lack of return traffic. The owners ofOrmonde estimate that it would be necessary to charge a fare of  120 per head, butit will probably prove possible to reduce this to about  110 per head. We considerthat it would be desirable to offer these three ships to Australia on the basis thatthe cost of refitting for emigrants would be borne wholly by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, while (i) the fares in respect of ex-servicemen would be paid wholly by theUnited Kingdom Government and (ii) in the case of other assisted migrants thefare, apart from the  10 paid by the migrant himself, would be shared equally between the two Governments. His Majesty&apos;s Government are already under a legal obligation to the owners of the three ships to recondition them, or to com-compensate the owners for failure to do so, and an agreement to discharge our liabilityby refitting any of these ships, which are all nearing the end of their life, for theemigrant traffic to Australia, to the standards settled between the two Govern-ments would be a sound and justifiable method of limiting our liability under theexisting contracts with owners to a reasonable figure. An agreement on theselines for the Ormonde, as an example, would achieve a maximum saving of 200,000 to His Majesty&apos;s Government. Against this, the increased cost of faresto the United Kingdom Government arising from the use of the Ormonde would amount to about  300,000 during the course of the next four years. Havingregard, however, to the general policy described in paragraph 4 and the declaredintention of the United Kingdom Government to give all reasonable assistance
to the Commonwealth Government in obtaining migrants from this country, we feel that the acceptance of this additional liability is not only justified butnecessary as a means of showing that we are in earnest in fulfilling our under-takings in pursuance of the migration policy upon which we and Australia are agreed.7. The employment of the Aquitania for this purpose would enable 8,000migrants to be moved in a full year as against 6,600 in the case of the threetroopers, but her use for emigrant traffic raises different problems. Such use would be expensive and in many ways uneconomical, and falls outside any arrangements which we had in mind when making the agreements of March 1946.It could be justified only by the desire of the Commonwealth Government to speedup the movement of emigrants at all costs. The cost of fitting the Aquitaniafor emigrant traffic would be comparatively small, and His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment will, in any case, have to discharge sooner or later a legal obligation underthe existing agreement with the Company in respect of reconditioning. Theextravagance arises in the operation of a ship of this class in emigrant traffic to Australia. At fares of about  70 per head, the earnings of the ship would show a deficit of over  500,000 per annum, at four voyages a year, against theestimated cost of operating her in the trade and the provision which must bemade for hire. Accordingly the fare per head could not reasonably be fixed below 135. (The company themselves have proposed  140 a head.) If, therefore, wecan meet Australia, by offering the three troopers on the terms mentioned inparagraph 6, it would not be unreasonable to inform the commonwealth government that, for the reasons mentioned above if they wish to obtain theAquitania, they must themselves make all arrangements with the ShippingCompany, and the only financial liability which the United Kingdom government-ment could accept (apart from the cost of refitting) would be limited to paying a fare of  70 a head for ex-service migrants and  30 a head (i.e., half of  70minus  10 for other migrants).recommendations.   We should accordingly be glad if the Cabinet would authorise (a) the utilisation of the three troopships mentioned in paragraph 5, whenthey become available, for the carriage of migrants to Australia onthe terms described in paragraph 6;ib) a communication to the Commonwealth Government as to the A quitaniaon the lines suggested in paragraph 7;(c) the conversion of the troopships and the A quitania (if the commonwealth government decide to pursue this suggestion) for this purpose atthe cost of United Kingdom funds; and(d) exploration of any other methods of increasing the supply of shipping for this purpose, including the possibility of chartering or purchasing-vessels from foreign countries, in which case the allocation of finan-cial liability would be for consideration.A.G. A. I.22nd February, 1947.ANNEX ICypher Telegram from the Prime Minister of Australia to the PrimeMinister, despatched 11th December, 1946(No. 416)Addressed to Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, No. 416, repeated to High Commissioner, Australia House, No. 6748.Following for the Prime Minister from the Prime Minister : As you are probably aware, negotiations have been carried on at official and ministerial levels between representatives of your Government and repre-sentatives of the Australian Government in London in regard to the provisionof shipping for the carriage of migrants from the United Kingdom to Australiadu ring 1947 under the free and assisted passage schemes.2. The situation in regard to the acute shortage of shipping, and thedifficulty with which your Government is faced in endeavouring to meet globaldemands, is fully appreciated.
3. It was anticipated that, following the end of the war, the shipping position would have improved, and our migration planning has been on thebasis that 35,000 migrant passages would be available for 1947. negotiations to date between representatives of our Governments indicate that number ofberths that can be made available for migrants may be less than 6,500 during1947, and the highest figure that has been mentioned is 10,000. These negotia-tions are still proceeding.4. Following upon a conference held with the Premiers of all States inAugust last, the State Governments [corrupt group : ? undertook] a survey oftheir absorptive capacity for migrants during 1947. These surveys have beencompleted, and show that, throughout the Commonwealth 46,661 migrants couldbe employed over a wide range of industries and occupations. This figureexcludes dependants, and also groups of child migrants who may be introduced by child migration organisations. The figure of 46,661 relates to jobs available,and is based conservatively. In terms of migrants it represents upwards of120,000 men, women and children.5. The future development and security of Australia will very largely depend on the augmenting of our population by immigration, and the targetaimed at by the Commonwealth Government is the introduction of 70,000 migrantsper annum from all sources. I realise that shipping and other factors will prevent this target being achieved for some time yet, and that during 1947 only a proportion of the migrants offering in the United Kingdom can be lifted. Inei-dentally, migration inquiries recorded at Australia House, London, up to theend of October cover over 156,000 men, women and children.6. Immigration is of great national as well as political significance toAustralia, and serious repercussions will arise unless a reasonable allocation ofshipping for migrants in relation to our requirements can be made for 1947.Knowing your many problems, it is with considerable reluctance that I feel obliged to seek your intervention and assistance to ensure that shipping is madeavailable to lift a minimum of 25.000 migrants under the free and assisted passage schemes during 194-7.7. I have referred to the national and political significance of this problem to Australia, and I feel sure that you, with me, will also appreciate the importance from the Empire aspect of rendering assistance to us in our desire that ourmigration plans for 1.947 should provide for a substantial quota of our kinsfolkfrom the United Kingdom. I do therefore earnestly request your interest andefforts in securing for Australia an allocation of migrant passages for 1947 onthe basis indicated in the preceding paragraph. After carefully weighing every consideration, I feel strongly that failure to achieve this objective will seriouslyembarrass my Governments position on the question of immigration.ANNEX IICypher Telegram from the Prime Minister to the Prime Minister of Australia,Despatched 11th January, 1947(No. 12)Your telegram 11th December, No. 416.Following for Prime Minister from Prime Minister.   Begins: I have considered carefully your message regarding the question of shipping facilities for migrants in the immediate future.Let me say first of all that I fully appreciate the most important considera-tions set out in paragraphs 6 and 7 of your telegram and that the Government herefully adhere to their intention to carry out the arrangements set out in agreements between our two Governments of the 5th March. We are anxious to help to thebest of our ability in providing the additional manpower which Australia needs and we hope that it will be possible to make such arrangements as will avoid anyconflict of interest arising out of your needs and our own difficult manpowerproblems.I am therefore arranging for the existing plans to be further examined, inthe hope that at any rate some increase in the number of migrant passages abovethe present estimate may prove possible. I find the estimate for 1947 made here was 3,500 and I agree that is a disappointing figure. The further examinationwill necessarily take a little time, but I will telegraph further on this aspect assoon as possible.   Ends.
