(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET COPY NO,7Hi FEBRUARY,   1947CABINETPAPER FOR A FASCIST PERIODICALMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeGn 18th July,  1946,  I submitted to the lord president&apos;s Committee a memorandum (L.F.(46) 159) on anapplication for a quota of paper for book publishing froma firm which before the war published books on behalf ofthe British Union of Fascists.      It was decided to allow the application,  and this decision was subsequentlyconfirmed in Cabinet  (CM. (46) 69th Conclusions,  Minute 5).An application has now been received from theSanctuary Press Ltd.  for a quota of paper in order thatthey may re-issue &quot;Action&quot;  (the former organ of the british union of Fascists) which ceased publication in June 1940,Under the provisions of the Control of PaperOrders any periodical may consume in a four months&apos; period13-3-0-o of the amount of paper it used in the year ended51st August,  1939.       It has been the practice of the PaperControl to allow every publisher to use the amountpermitted by the operative Order and on application tolicense a mill to deliver up to that quantity of paper for the purpose.      All&apos; periodicals receive the appropriatepercentage of their pre-war consumption irrespective oftheir subject matter and whether or not they have been running throughout the war period or have since beenrevived.As was pointed out in the memorandum referred toabove,  hitherto paper has always been made availableaccording to certain general rules and no attempt hasbeen made to censor publications through the machineryof paper allocation.      Thus paper is allowed for the periodical &quot;Spain&quot;,  a pro-Franco journal, for the &quot;BedfordNews Letter&quot;,  the &quot;Freedom Press&quot;,  and. other publicationswhich might be the subject matter of public criticism,   onthe same basis as for any other periodical.In the case of the publication. &quot;Action&quot;  it isestimated that on the basis of the pre-war consumption,the publishers might now use up to 12 tons of paper in4 months.      This will enable a considerable circulation to be attained.      My own opinion is that we should allow the firm their normal quota of paper as was done in thecase of the Fascist book publishers;    but in view of thepolitical issues involved I should be grateful for theviews of my colleagues.R. 8.C.Board of Trade, Millbank,  8.W.I.-7th February,   1947,
