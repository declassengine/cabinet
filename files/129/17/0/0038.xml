THIS DOCUMENT   IS  THE   PROPERTY  OF ;H S   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT&quot; &apos;      &quot;   , &quot; * 9 A ^5- . - Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1947 f*V 6SECRET &apos; &apos; &apos;        Copy Mo. ? 9CP. (17) 8813th March, 1947CABINETRESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CARE OF DEPRIVED CHILDRENMemorandum by the Minister of education the memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal (CP. (47) 80) concludes thatcentral responsibility for the care of deprived children should be concentrated inthe Home Office. I do not agree with this conclusion. My opinion is the sameas that expressed by my predecessor at an earlier stage in the discussion of thismatter, namely, that central responsibility should be vested in the Ministry ofEducation working through the Local Education Authorities. I believe that the welfare of the children will be best served by this arrangement, and that thearguments in its favour have not been adequately met in the Lord Privy SeaFsmemorandum.-2. Paragraph 5 and onwards :of the memorandum by the Lord Privy Sealset out a number of arguments which purport to tell in favour of the Home Office.In my view, these ;arguments, as set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (e), are open to substantial criticism. In particular. I wish .to draw attention to the followingpoints :-(a) The ^provision of a substitute home is additional to and distinct from theprovision of health services Qr education. True as this -may be if an arrow meaning is given to education, it is not an argument for one central department (or for one instrument of local administration)rather than for another. In fact, though the provision of a substitutehome may be distinct from education, the whole tendency in recenttimes has been to recognise that it is a natural addition to and develop-ment of educational administration. It is. for example, the LocalEducation Authority which has the duty of bringing children in need of care and protection before the Courts and of boarding out thosecommitted by the Courts to its care; it is the Local EducationAuthority which can, and in ,a number of important areas does&apos;,,perform the duties of the Public Assistance Authority in findingsubstitute homes for children; it is the Local Education authority which has the duty to provide and maintain approved : schools andremand homes. It would thus be in keeping with the current trend of development for central responsibility to be entrusted to theMinistry of Education, whose present job is of such a kind (coveringboarding schools of many varieties, child guidance clinics, youth clubs)that the extra job would be a natural addition. On the other hand,only one of the Home Office&apos;s present activities (a portion of itsChildren&apos;s Branch work) makes the Home Office seem suitable : mostof its other activities make it, at any rate in appearance, unsuitable.(b) The essence of providing a home is to treat the child as an individual and the Home Office staff, by tradition and training, are well able toto do this. While I dq not dispute that the Home Office staff are qualified for this task, I have no evidence which suggests that theyare better qualified than the staff of the Ministry of Education whichin its day-to-day work is accustomed to undertaking a large amountof individual case work.   And it is of the essence of the Education[33307]
Act that the Ministry of Education, Local Education Authorities andtheir officials should consider each child as an individual, should take account of home conditions and work in with parents where they exist(personal record cards, for example, are now being kept for each childthroughout his school life). The technique required for the new iobwould therefore be a natural extension of the technique required for present work.(c) The Children&apos;s Branch of the Home Office have always had a general responsibility for furthering the welfare of children in all respectsnot the specialist concern of other Departments. These words imply that education should be regarded as a specialist service. In one sense,of course, it is. But it deals with many more aspects of the welfare of many more children than have ever been the concern of the HomeOffice. Some examples showing the wide range of these aspects arelisted in paragraph 7 (a) of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s memorandum.Further, that memorandum states that &quot; all children who forany cause are brought before a Juvenile Court come within the HomeOffice sphere of responsibility.&quot; But the numerous school attendancecases which may now come before those Courts are the primaryconcern of the Local Education Authorities and the Ministry ofEducation.(d) It is suggested that the Curtis Committee themselves leaned to the viewthat responsibility should be given to the Home Office. It should beremembered, and indeed it is evident from the frequent references in the Report to education as &quot;mental training,&quot; that few, if any,of its members had accurate knowledge of the present day education service. Even so I cannot agree that paragraph 434 of the Reportnecessarily implies an opinion against central responsibility passingto the Ministry of Education.(e) There is no evidence that the administrative difficulties involved intransferring responsibility for deprived children to a Departmentother than the Home Office would be as great as is alleged. Theywould certainly not be insuperable. In any case, they should not beallowed to count by comparison with the welfare of the children.And it seems to me fundamentally wrong deliberately to subordinatethe interests of the children so as to use them as guinea pigs forexperiments which may be hoped to result in penal reform.3. I take strong exception to the statement in paragraph 9 of the lord privy Seal&apos;s memorandum that &quot;we do not believe that the views of LocalAuthorities in this matter are primarily influenced by regard for the needs ofthe children concerned.&quot; In my experience Local Authorities, and Local Educa-tion Authorities in particular, have a deep concern for the welfare of thechildren for -whom tihey are responsible. I am sure that Local EducationAuthorities in taking their very firm stand against the Curtis recommendation for ad hoc Committees have been concerned with the children&apos;s good rather than with their own aggrandisement. Their fears that in practice ad hoc Children&apos;sCommittees would often turn out to be Public Assistance Committees in a newdress are genuine and cannot be lightly dismissed.4. Finally, we cannot disregard the question of administrative man-power.I am convinced that the improvement we all wish to see in this social service can be achieved with substantially greater economy of man-power if the work is added to the present responsibilities of His Majesty&apos;s Inspectors of schools and the Ministry of Education, than if (in the words of the Government state-ment proposed in CP. (47) 80) &quot;a new and enlarged Children&apos;s Branch [is]created in the Home Office with an expanded inspectorate organised on a regional basis.&quot;G. T.Ministry of Education, S.W. 1,13th March, 1947.
