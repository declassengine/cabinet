(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HISSECRETCP. (47) 9014th March,   1947BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.CABINETABOLITION OP SPECIAL JURIESJoint Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor and the HomeSecretaryWe have given consideration to the question whether there is any longer a necessity for special juries to beavailable for the trial of either civil or criminal matters,2, Under the existing system special juries areavailable for the trial of all civil matters which the parties are entitled to have tried before a jury or which the court or  judge orders to be so tried.In 1958,  the last year in which the right to aspecial jury was unaffected by temporary war-time legislation,76 civil actions were tried before special juries in theKing&apos;s Bench Division of the High Court and 7 petitions forDivorce.The High Court has power to order a criminal case to be tried with a special jury.      This power was rarelyexercised,  and no such order    has been made during the lasttwenty-five years.3, The qualifications of jurors are as follows:-A- -   Common JurorResidence  in the county in which the trial takes place,  and being either -(l)      An absolute owner of land worth at least  101 a year, - or(2)     A holder of a lease for at least 21 yearsworth  20 a year,  or(3)      A householder who is also a ratepayer ratedat  20 a year (or  30 in London and Middlesex).(Juries Act,  1825, S.   I. )P*      Special JurorA.person qualified to sit on a common jury who Isalso either -
i&apos;j 1&apos;(l)    A person legally entitled to be called &quot;Esquire&quot;or a person of higher degree, or(2)    A hanker or merchant,  or(3)    An occupier of a private dwelling house of arateable value of not less than  100 in a town of at least 20,000 inhabitants,  or 50 elsewhere,  or(4)    An occupier of a farm of value not less than 300 or other premises of a rateable valueof not less than  100.(Juries Act,  18*?0, S.  6.)C*      City of London Common Juror(l)    A householder or occupier of a shop, warehousecounting-house, chambers or office, for thepurpose of trade or commerce within the City,  and(2)    Has land,  tenements or personal estate of thevalue of  100.(Juries Act,  1825, S.  50. )D.      City of London Special JurorA person qualified to sit on a City of London CommonJury, who is also qualified as a special juror underB.   ah 0 v e.4. Special juries have been available to litigantsat least since the fifteenth century.      They,  no doubt, came into being because of the low standard of education of thegeneral public which then prevailed,  necessitating,  for themore intricate forms of litigation,   jurors more likely byeducation and experience to be caopable of  judging complicatedissues.      The Education Acts have made a vital change since1870 when the last Act prescribing the qualifications ofspecial jurors was passed.      Ho doubt special juries continueto be used because litigants, or their advisers, sti.llconsider that the special juror is likely to be bettereducated than the common juror,  or because they think aspecial jury more likely to favour their point  of view.In view of modern conditions the distinction has lost muohof its force and there, is much to be said in favour of ajury being drawn from all classes of the community.The fact that special juries are used with suchrarity in criminal trials shows that common juries are considered fit to try issues which may well be as complicatedas any civil action and where the effects of the verdict uponthe prisoner may well be far more serious than any verdicta civil jury could give.There is a case for retaining the special jurydrawn from the City of London to hear Commercial Causes whichare of a specialist or technical nature.      The matters a tissue would be within the day to day experience of such ajury but would be outside the scope of one drawn from personsnot so qualified.
5, For these reasons we are of opinion that thespecial jury is an unnecessary anachronism and should heabolished (with the possible exception of its use in commercial Causes), leaving to a jury drawn from all sectionsof the community the trial of actions now triable by spefialjuries,6. The right to a special jury depends upon statute(now Section 30 of the Juries Act,  1825).      Legislation will,therefore, be required to effect this change.      This we donot consider to be so urgent that we should ask for time fora Bill next Session-    moreover it will be difficult to confinea Bill to this single purpose,  and the question of theamendment in other respects of the existing law relating tojury service might have to be considered.      The main questionswhich arise are:-(i)     Whether the qualifications of a   common jurorshould be altered;(ii) Whether the exemptions from liability tojury service should be altered;(iii)      Whether jurors should be paid;(iv) Whether any changes are desirable in themethod by which juries are summoned andselected.These matters are being enopired into on the official level.&apos;In view, however, of the interest shown inParliament on this question, we ask that the Government should(l)      decide now  that,  as a matter of principle,special juries should be abolished,  exceptfor the City cf London Special Jury in commercial Causes,    and(2)      authorise a statement being made in parliament that the Government have so decided as amatter of principle, but cannot promise early legislation.J.J.C.E.14th March,   1947.
