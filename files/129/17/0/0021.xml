Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1947SECRET CoWA?- ^JC.F. (47) 712Qth February, 1947CABINETJAPANESE REPARATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall that theCabinet, at its meeting on 13th January,agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom should support theUnited States proposal for the distributionof Japanese reparations by the issuing of interim directives, if the United StatesGovernment reached the conclusion that nofurther progress towards a solution couldbe made within the Far Eastern Commis-sion. The United States Government were informed accordingly.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washing-ton has now reported that the UnitedStates Government have for the presentabandoned their plans for the issue of interim directives and have decided toreturn the problem to the Far eastern commission.  At the same time, they have put forward for consideration by theCommission proposals for a programme of immediate interim removals of a propor-tion of the available reparations materials.These proposals are now being examined.His Maj esty&apos;s Government felt some mis-givings as to the political consequences ofthe interim directives procedure, to whichthe Russians would almost certainly haveobj ected strongly. The Dominions Govern-ments also saw; disadvantages. The changein the American plans is therefore not oneto which we should object, provided thatthe resumption of discussions in the Corn-mission does not lead to undue delay.E.
