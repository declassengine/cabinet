IBISDOCUMENT   IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF   HIS   BRITANNIC  MiUBSTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT?Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1947SECRETJ  CP. (47) 8512th March, 1947CABINETRESPONSIBILITY FOR THE  CARE  OF  DEPRIVED  CHILDRENMemorandum by the Minister of health i. I regret that I cannot agree with the proposals made in the Memorandumby the Lord Privy Seal (CP. (47) 80). When the question of central responsibilityfirst arose I did not press the claims of the Ministry of Health, for it seemedto me then that the interests of the children and they are the paramountconsideration would be equally well served whichever Department had centralresponsibility. But on reflection, and as a result of enquiries I have made bothin Parliament and outside it. I have been compelled to change my view.2. I am convinced that the political consequences of placing responsibility on the Home Office would be grave. There would be widespread indignationthroughout the country generally and among Government supporters inparticular. I am sure that the Home Secretary would discharge his duties withhumanity but, none the less, it would be represented that the Government had handed over the care of those unfortunate children to the Department whichlooked after delinquent children and that they would come under the police.3. There would be less political objection to selecting the Ministry ofEducation. But I really think it is pushing the claims of Education too far to suggest that it should look after deprived children. The aim and object ofour care for those children should be to provide them with something whichgoes beyond the confines of education, however liberally education may beconstrued. The children should be found homes and people who will look afterthem as parents or guardians, or they should be placed in institutions run on home lines. The teacher and the educational system have a definite and a very important place in the life of a child but it is a different place from that ofthe parent.4. It might be said similarly that it is pushing the claims of health too far to suggest that the health authorities should have this duty of guardianship,but this is to ignore the welfare side of local authorities and of the Ministryof Health welfare which starts with the babies and extends to the aged and.infirm. Under the National Health Service Act and the National AssistanceBill, those general welfare functions will be widely extended. This is part ofa comprehensive welfare scheme which will cater for all those who are unableadequately to look after themselves, through misfortune, infirmity or age. 1stress the comprehensiveness of this welfare service and I will return to thispoint.5. I believe that to give this task to the Home Office or to the Ministry ofEducation would be much less economical than to entrust it to the Ministry ofHealth. Under the Home Office there would have to be created what is virtuallya new service, and the Ministry of Education could not leave the responsibilitylocally to School Attendance Officers. This is an important factor at a timewhen we are all so much concerned with the growth of national and local govern-ment staffs and have a special duty to keep the numbers down. In the case ofthe Ministry of Health all that would be necessary would be to supplement theexisting Health Visitors&apos; Service by the appointment of some specialist children&apos;s[33293]
sofficers, by arranging special courses for the existing health visitors or someof them, and by the enrolment of some additional women of commonsense and experience.8. Under the Ministry of Health, the local organisation of this job wouldbe simpler and more natural. The basis would be the existing Child WelfareSub-Committees of the Health authorities with co-opted members from other appropriate committees, including the Education Committee. Thus the expan-sion of machinery and staff which is apt to accompany the creation of new localgovernment forms would be avoided. The Health Visitors go into the homesof nearly 97 per cent, of the babies born in this country every year. No other service, therefore, has such intimate knowledge of British homes and parents,or such opportunities of effective, educative and preventive work, or is so well placed to recruit suitable foster-homes; and for the deprived children boarding-out, with foster-parents carefully selected, is much to be preferred to maintenance in an institutional home however good.7. An outstanding virtue of an arrangement of this sort is that the deprived children are not segregated and are not dealt with separately from the othermembers of the community, as will tend to happen where specialist services are set up. If the Health Visitors and their colleagues are already in touch withall the homes, no-one is to know for what exact purpose visits to the homes arebeing made, and therefore no-one oan point the finger at any particular home or at any particular child and make reflections upon their misfortunes. Thechildren themselves, who should be our first thought, will thus grow up in amuch sweeter atmosphere than has been possible for all too many of them inthe past.   This is a matter to which I attach the utmost importance.8. The Home Office should in my view retain their present responsibilityfor juvenile courts, remand homes and approved schools : those are the necessarypenal, quasi-penal and remedial arrangements for the delinquent children. ButI hold as a matter of principle that those children who are merely the victims of misfortune should be separated from the delinquents. The true function ofthe juvenile courts should be to ensure that while any necessary and appropriatereforming influences are brought to bear on delinquent children and those whoare beyond their parents&apos; control, ordinary homeless children are passed by thosecourts back to the care of the comprehensive welfare authority.9. I am not anxious to lay additional burdens upon the Ministry of Health,which already has so much to do. The Ministry of Health, however, has a responsibility for a larger number of deprived children than any other Ministry.It has a tradition of co operation with the local authorities. I do not claim that it has always in the past discharged those responsibilities conspicuouslywell, though much fine work has been done. Where there has been failure ithas been due in part, at least, to having to work under the old Poor Law. Thatcode is about to be abolished. It will be replaced by a new code with a newspirit and I believe that it will be easier for the Ministry of Health to bringabout the awakening of the new spirit in the local authorities and to directtheir efforts more vigorously along modern lines of thought. The title of theMinistry of Health is apt to mislead us: it is quite wrong to suppose that ourbusiness is confined to health services in any narrow sense. I think it isconstitutionally important that a new general welfare service, to be run by localauthorities, should be the responsibility of this Ministry, with its old traditions of friendly association with local government over a wide field of activity.A. B.Ministry of Health, S. W. 1,12th March, 1947.
