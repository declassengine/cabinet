(THIS DOCUMENT  13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S^JB C R B T COPY NO.C. P. (47) 6426TH FEBRUARY,   1947CABINETANGLO-FRENCH ALLIANCEMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign affairs it will he remembered that in the communique issued at the conclusion of Monsieur Leon Blum&apos;s recent visit to this country it was stated that:&quot;It was recognised, that the two countries having beentwice attacked by Germany in a period of 25 years have an equal interest in protecting themselves against a freshGerman menace.      It was therefore agreed that  in thesecircumstances a Treaty of Alliance should be concluded betweenthem at the earliest possible moment within the framework ofArticle 52 of the Charter of the United Nations and with theobject of preventing any further aggression by Germany and of preserving peace and security.      It was agreed that negotiations to this end should be opened as soon as possible&quot;.Discussions regarding the Alliance were startedabout a fortnight ago between the Permanent Under-Secretaryof State at the Foreign Office and the French Ambassador and agreement has now been reached at the official level on the text of the Treaty.      A copy of this text is annexed below.It will be seen that the Treaty is,  as agreed withM.  Blum,  drawn up with the main object of preventing anyfurther German aggression and that it follows the general lines of the Anglo-Soviet and the Franco-Soviet Treaties.It is largely based on a draft prepared in the ForeignOffice,Article I did not figure in the original British draft, but has been inserted at the urgent request of theFrench, who have argued that since the Franco-Soviet Treatycontains a similar clause,  it would be very difficult for themto agree to an Anglo-French Alliance which did not include asimilar Article.      It will be observed that it speciallysafeguards the Treaty proposed last autumn by Mr.  Byrneswhereby the 4 occupying Powers would take joint action toprevent any violation by Germany of her disarmament anddemilitarisation obligations.      At the same time the Articleonly commits us to action taken in agreement after consultation.Article II provides that Great Britain and Francewill come to each others assistance in the event of an actualattack on either of them by Germany.      This Article followsclosely the text of the original British draft which was cleared with the Chiefs of Staff.
Article II had no counterpart  in&apos; the originalBritish draft and has teen inserted at the request of theFrench Government.      It will he seen that here again the commitment is only to consult.Article IV is based on an Article in the originalBritish draft which was concurred in by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade.Article VI provides that the Treaty shall remainin force for 50 years.      It will be remembered that Irecently made a public offer to extend the life of theAnglo-Soviet Treaty to 50 years and it seems appropriate that the Anglo-French Alliance should run. for the sameperiod.I have been very conscious of the importance ofsaying nothing in the Anglo-French Treaty Which couldmilitate against the prospects  of the Byrnes Treaty ordiscourage the Americans from pursuing this proposal.       Itis clearly most important that we and the French shouldnot do anything which might give either isolationist opinion in -America or the Soviet Government an opportunity ofclaiming that a Four Power Treaty to guard against Germaninfringements of the military clauses of the Peace settlement was superfluous and that American intervention in thematter was therefore unnecessary.      I think,  however,  thatthe position as regards the Byrnes Treaty is adequatelysafeguarded by the statement in the Preamble that we consider such a Treaty as most desirable and by the reference inArticle I to the eventual conclusion of such a Treaty.The French Ambassador has forwarded this textto Paris and he has promised to let me know the views ofthe French Government in the next two or three days.      Heseems confident that the French Government will approve theTreaty as  it stands.In the hopes,  therefore,  that the French Governmentwill in fact approve the text and that the Chiefs of Staff,whom I am consulting urgently,  have no criticism to make,I ask for approval of this text and for authority to sign theTreaty before I leave for Moscow,   if as  I hope this can bearranged.      No doubt it will be thought desirable for the text of the Treaty,  once it has been approved by the Cabinet,to be communicated to the Dominions Governments for their information as long as possible before the actual signaturetakes place.      I would also propose to arrange for theUnited States and Soviet Governments to be informed officiallybeforehand of the position.      The U. S.  Government are already being informed unofficially of the progress which has beenmade.e. B.Foreign. 0f f ice,  S. W. I.26th February,  1947.
