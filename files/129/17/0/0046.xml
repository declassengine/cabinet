CIRCULATED . a-ll^ \*&quot;\ kL.6t jE\DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1947SECRET 1    ) Copy No.CP. (47) 962li///. March, 1947CABINETPUBLIC  BOARDS :   POLITICAL ACTIVITIES  OFAND STAFFNote by the Prime minister in view of the importance of the subject, I think that the Cabinet shouldformally take note of the conclusions reached by the Socialisation of -industries committee at their meeting on 25th February last (S.I. (M) (47) 1st Meeting.Minute 6) on the extent to which members and staffs of the Boards of socialised industries should participate in national and local politics. Their conclusions should afford a reasonable basis for a code of practice in this field.2. The Committee recognised that the underlying principle must be to leavethe members and staff of public boards with their full political rights as citizens,save in so far as the public interest otherwise requires; and attention was drawn to the extent to which public life would suffer if the many able men and women in the seiwices now being brought under public ownership were debarred from participation in national and local politics.The Committee considered that members of boards and their senior staffs should establish a tradition of public service, irrespective of party allegiances.Thus, participation in party politics on opposite sides by members of divisionalboards and area committees of a, public board might impair their efficiency asteams. There should also be no room for suspicion of political favouritism indealing with the public, in making appointments and promotions within theboard&apos;s service, or in the placing of contracts. In practice this would mean that members of boards should not engage in the more controversial forms of political activity and that boards should discourage, without forbidding, their senior officers from so engaging.[33333]
3. Members of the boards of socialised industries are debarred by statutefrom serving as Members of the House of Commons, and their senior staffs shouldbe discouraged from standing as candidates. Other members of their staff should normally be free to stand for Parliament; but it should be recognised that, ifthey were elected, they would not be able to give the necessary service to theiremployer. I do not think we need concern ourselves with the terms on which an employee might resume his employment on ceasing to be a Member ofParliament.4. I have already indicated, in reply to Questions in the House of Commons(Hansard, 12th March, 1946, Cols. 945-6, and 6th February, 1947, Col. I960),that it is not our intention that employees of undertakings brought under public ownership and control should be debarred from standing as candidates in local elections, or from serving on local councils if: elected. It should, however, be understood that the board of a socialised industry would be entitled to review the position of an employee who was devoting such an amount of time to localgovernment activities as to prejudice his efficiency as an employee.10, downing  Street, S.W. 1,26^ March, 1947.C.
