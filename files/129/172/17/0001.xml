Every suggestionhas been rejected.G r department of the Environment29 October 1973
(confidential)1. The following are the proposals which we have considered.LOCAL INCOME TAX2.   This was the first choice of the local authority associations in amemorandum published in March 1972a   But the advocates of the tax tended to brush aside the very substantial administrative problems which wouldbe involved in its introductionDLOCAL SALES TAX3o This proposal received little support from local;government andothers. Host recognised that the introduction of VAT:made a locallyvariable sales tax impracticable for some years0LOCAL EMPLOH-iSKT TAXIt.   This tax also received little support from the local authority associations, possibly on the grounds it would be too much like theformer Selective Employment Tax.K0T0.H FUEL DUTY5o   This was the second choice of the local authority associations whoproposed that county councils should have discretion&apos;to levy anadditional tax not exceeding 5p per gallon on motor fuel.   A localduty would, however, inevitably have to be at the expense of thenational duty because of the difficulty of increasing total taxati on.on motor fuel.   There would also be administrative problems; the incidence would, moreover, fall largely on industry end not on the/   private consumer0 -(confidential)Annex
(rnbMOTOR VEHICLE DUTIES&amp;%   The disadvantages of transferring these duties to local governmentare mainly administrative.   Although it would be possible soon totransfer to local government the sums collected from their own areas,it   would be impracticable to introduce local variations until thelate 1970s at the earliest.MINISTERIAL CONSIDERATION7o   Of the various local taxes listed in paragraphs 2-6 above, the      Iproposal for a local motor fuel duty seemed the most likely starter0Accordingly, the possibility of introducing such a tax was consideredby the Prime Minister with, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the then Secretary of State for the Environment on 2 August 1972 o   In thelight of the difficulties outlined in paragraph $ above, however, .they       agreed that the introduction of a local motor fuel duty shouldnot be pursued and that any further relief to ratepayers required from197h/7!? onwards should be effected by transfers of services inconjunction with the continued use of rate support grant.   this conclusion, with an accompanying report by officials about the transferof services, and a memorandum by the Chief Se        ry. Treasury (RS(73)7)was further discussed byRE Committee on 1 February 1973 (RE(73)2nd Meeting ,Item 1). At that meeting the Committee invited the Chief Secretaryto consult the Chancellor about the need to re-examine  alternative sources of local revenue, including a local sales tax and a local incometax.   The Chancellor and the Chief Secretary reconsidered the case for an additional source of local taxation&apos;&quot;tot;- local government, but their view remained that the introduction of any new tax would not atpresent be feasible and that the advantages would be out-weighed bythe very considerable practical difficulties involved.

But RE Committee agreed in July, 1972 not to introduce asurcharge on the grounds that the cost of collection would be high in proportion to yield and that it would be regressive unless accompaniedby exemptions and relief 3 evasion&apos;would also be rife i(RE(72)l6 andRE(72)Uth Meeting, Item 2 end (7?) th Meeting, Item l)aWRITE-OFF OF DSi3T9o   RE(73)6 and 7 discussed the question of the possibility of includingnon-trading loan debt of existing local authorities as at 31 March 197k*However, RE Committee at its meeting on 1.February 1973 (RE(73)2,ndMeeting, Item 1) did not favour the proposal,LOCAL LOTTERIES10o   A review of the law on lotteries by officials was put in hand in1971.
