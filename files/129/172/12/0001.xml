PRICE AND PAY CODE FOR STAGE 31. Consultations on the draft Price and Pay Code for Stage 3,published on 8 October, are substantially complete,, and this notesets out the amendments to the Code which are proposed as a result,2.        Scope of consultations.    As in Stage 2, consultation covered the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), Retail Consortium, nationalised industries, Association of British Chambers of Commerce and particularmanufacturing and other industries: food, chemicals, construction, cement.They also covered th&amp; professions, consumer representatives and, on the pay side, engineering employers and a range of public sector employers.The Pay Board and Price Commission have also been consulted.    Except,of course, for the Trades Union Congress, there was general acceptanceof the need to continue pay and price controls.3.        Amendments proposed.    In considering what amendments could beaccepted, the group of Ministers considering policy on prices and pay in stage 3 had in mind the following. On pay, the CBI represented that the Code was biased infavour of the public sector as employer: public sector employers were closer to the formulation of pay policy.    Any further move inthat direction (either in the nationalised or public service sector)would sap the willingness of the private sector to comply.ii. On prices, final CBI representations were much concernedwith incentives to efficiency, with investment and with improvements in administration of the control.iii. Developments since announcement of the Stage 3 proposals on 8 October underline the need to avoid further substantialrelaxations on either pay or prices.    Taking account of theincrease in oil prices, there is now a real risk of a paymentunder the 7 per cent threshold by the end of Stage 3.4.        On pay, the amendments proposed are mainly technical,    london transport will get some help from a minor change in the rules for &quot;unsocialhours&quot; payments; and there is a new  350 limit on payments underpre-standstill profit-sharing schemes (the Stratton case).    It was concludedhowever that amendments to widen &quot;anomalies&quot; action (eg by extension tothe Forces, or by retrospection beyond that recommended by the pay board) could not safely be made.    The position of the Forces could beconsidered at the time of their review in April 1974.5.        On prices, three changes relate to efficiency or investment: the profit margin control is eased for investment for vertical integration orlabour saving, and also for some recovery situations; the relief forcyclical capital intensive enterprises has been reshaped after consultation.1
Paragraph 3OA (limit on profit reduction) now gives a wider choice of baseperiod, and is also applied to construction.    On administration the periodof consideration of applications by the Commission is to be limited to four weeks.    On &quot;splitting&quot;, paragraph 53 is not a wholly satisfactory balance between preventing artificial subdivision and permitting it when genuine but no better formula has yet been found,,6.        A text of the Code showing amendments now proposed will be circulated to Cabinet during Wednesday 24 October.    Subject to cabinet approval, the Code Order will be made at the end of the week and published on Tuesday 30 October so that it can take effect for prices on 1 november and pay on 7 November,    The amendments will be explained by press notice and full information about the new Code as a whole will be issuedby the two Agencies.23 October 1973
