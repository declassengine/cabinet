SCHEDULETHE PRICE AND PAY CODE Article  &apos;f(f      J     B g\e f--   t!   1-8*&quot; I X)   ft I f4iI. The Code has a dual function. First, the Price Commission and pay board are required to exercise their powers so as to ensure that it is implc-rhcnted. Secondly, all those concerned with the determination of prices and pay should have regard to it.2. The Code is therefore addressed both to the Commission and the Boardand to all those concerned with price and pay- determination. Part I dealswith prices and Part II with pay.Part J-PricesGenera! Principles3.   The general principles relating to prices are:  (i) to limit the extent to which prices may be increased on account of increased costs, and to secure reductions as a result of reduced costs;(ii) to reinforce the control of prices by a control on profit margins whilesafeguarding investment;(iii) to reinforce the effects of competition, and to secure its full benefits inthe general level of prices.Field of Application4. With the exceptions specified in paragraphs 5 to 10 below, the prices ofgoods and services supplied to the United Kingdom home market are withinthe scope of the control.5. The prices of goods and services exported (whether directly or through an agent or merchant) are not controlled.6.   The following are not controlled :-(i) prices paid on first sale into the United Kingdom of imported goods and services;(ii) prices of goods and services where the application of the control wouldbe inconsistent with an international agreement or arrangement. Forthis purpose, an international agreement or arrangement is one between states or organisations of states, not between firms;(iii) prices at sales by auction, where such sales are a normal practice in theparticular trade;(iv) prices of goods at the point of sale on a commodity market in theUnited Kingdom such as the London Metal Exchange or prices directlydetermined by reference to such markets;(v) prices of second-hand goods (other than second-hand road vehicles soldby distributors);(vi) charges for the carriage of goods or passengers on internationaljourneys; charges for air navigation, landing and related services and ship, passenger and goods dues, provided that they relate wholly or mainly to such traffic; charges for international mail, Giro, remittanceand telecommunication services;(viij prices of ethical medicines supplied to the United Kingdom market tothe extent that regulation of their prices is within the scope of any agreement relating to those prices made between the Secretary of Statefor Social Services and representatives of manufacturers of thosemedicines; but only so long as such an agreement is in force;W\ AtCONBVtlN&apos;! irv*
(viii) prices in contracts for the Secretary of State for Defence for warlike stores and services which are within the agreement between HerMajcsly&apos;s Government anil industry governing the. pricing of, and controlof profit from, non-competitive contracts. These prices will be subjectto the controls provided in that agreement;(ix) insurance premiums, which will be subject to restriction by the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry;(x) taxi fares, where subject to control by the Home Secretary or (heSecretary of State for Scotland;(x)(a) charges payable to returning officers inconnection with Parliamentary elections,determined under the Representation of thePeople Act, 1949;(xi) prices determined by a statutory body which, as a result of an order made under section 8 of the Counter-Inflation Act 1973, is required toapply the Code to the determination of those prices;(xii) subscriptions and certain prices charged by non-profit-making organisa-tions as in paragraphs 98 to 100.vApplication to Food, Fanning and Forestry Products7. The prices of manufactured food and drink, like those of manufactured products generally, are within the scope of the control as are those of semi-processed foodstuffs such as butter, cheese, sugar and quick-frozen vegetables.8. The prices paid to United Kingdom producers or producers&apos; organisationsor to overseas suppliers for fresh foods and similar products, which are subject to fluctuations on world and United Kingdom markets because ofseasonal factors or changes in the relationship between supply and demand,are not controlled. This applies in particular to meat, including bacon and poultry, fish, eggs, fruit and vegetables. However, enterprises which resell these products, whether home-produced or imported, at any subsequent stage will besubject to control.9. The retail price of milk for liquid consumption and the margins of milkdistributors will continue to be subject to the existing controls by the Ministerof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland.So long as these controls apply, the price of milk for liquid consumption willnot be subject to the Code.9A.   The prices of milk for.manufacture of products for sale in the United Kingdom will, however, &quot;besubject to the following requirements.   except where the Milk Marketing Boards incur additionalallowable cost increases in marketing the milk:-(i) the price of milk for the manufacture of butter and skimmed milkpowder may not be increased above current levels (adjusted as necessary -sary to reflect changes in the intervention prices); and(ii) for other milk products, the price of milk may not be increased abovethe prices of milk for butter and skimmed milk powder (adjusted by not more than the average premium received by the Boards for milk for the product concerned over the butter and skimmed milk prices in the year ending 30 April 1973).10. What is said in paragraph 8 in relation to prices paid for fresh foodsapplies also to prices of other primary products of animal or vegetable originwhich are subject to similar fluctuations.Charges11. References in the Code to prices include references to charges, unless there is explicit provision to the contrary.&apos;Goods and Services12.   References in the Code to goods     or productsinclude references to services, unless there is explicit provision to the contrary.24
f**\K inr^rN its h IB8BHL- &quot;Tiaa^7     Definition of - Enterprise .With the exceptions described in paragraph 1JA, for thepurposes of the Code .enterprise means cither an enterprise as a whole or a separate constituent&quot;co&apos;mpanyor sub-division provided that in the latter case separate accounts for suchsub-divisions : (i) arc or can be made available -for all relevant periods;(ii) arc not materially distorted by transactions conducted otherwise than onarm&apos;s length terms;(iii) would, if combined with one another and with the accounls of all other activities or transactions of the enterprise, produce results consistent withthose shown by the accounts of the enterprise taken as a whole.1JA. The definition in paragraph     13   does not apply wherethe unit for net profit margin control, as defined inparagraphs 53 and 54-* is the relevant one.   accordingly the definition in paragraph 13 does not apply in paragraphs30A, 50 to 62j 63A, or where they deal with net profit-margins, in paragraphs 18,&apos;49, 63, 70 and 71?or in other/-paragraphs which refer to these.A:reference to an enterprise includes a reference to a co-operative, a partnership01 fS-an individual carrying on a business.Mixed -Enterprises. 14. Where the activities of an enterprise are not confined to manufacturingdistribution, or the provision of services, but include more than one of these&apos;each of these activities may be treated separately for all the purposes of the Codeincluding the calculation of net profit margins provided that adequate accounts: satisfying paragraph 13 are or can be made available for each of them.   where these activities arc not treated separately, the main activity of the enterprise will/determine whether the provisions  of the Code relating to manufacturincdistribution or services apply.Costs and Prices16. Prices which are within the control may not be increased unless thereis an increase in total costs per unit of output. No increase may exceed theincrease in total costs per unit.,17.   Where&apos; there is an increase in total costs per unit, only th0S8increases,defined . in the Code as &quot; allowable cost increases&quot;, may be taken intoaccount in arriving at the permitted price increase, and they will be subjectto a productivity deduction^ where aupropriate.Price Reduction18.   Prices should be reduced whenever possible.   Where there is a fallin raw material prices or other allowable costs, this should be fully reflected&apos;  in price reductions.   Reductions are however not required to exceed the fall in total costs per unit of output.   In addition prices.should be reduced as requiredin paragraphs 52 and 71 where,  In thfe Case Of &apos;a&apos;&quot;distributor,   itsgross percentage margin,m&amp; in the case of any enterprise,its profit margin reference level is exceeded, or is likelytp be exceeded.Hase Dale19. The starting point for the calculation of permitted price increases isthe level of costs per unit of output at 30 April 1973. In calculating permittedprice increases, cost increases first incurred after 30 April 1973 may be taken&apos; into account, to the extent that they have not already been reflected in prices.YYhere the price of a particular product or. of a range of related products has notbeen increased since 30 September 1972,      that date may,   at  the option of the enterprise, be substituted for 30 Aprilin paragraphs 21 and 25 below, &apos; However, except ^Ts in paragraph 20. the permitted price increase may not include any element of retrospective recovery of costs incurred before the date on which the price increase takes effect.20.   A permitted price increase-may include an eiemeiVC oi&quot; recovery ptcosA increases&apos; .....first   jarred between 30 April 1973 and the jd ate ot tlieP^nuUcd price -increase provided tnav.-&quot; &apos; - ^      -----      ....      ...   .
COhrlUriNi li At--(i) (he amount included in respect of such &quot;costs docs not exceed what wouldbe necessary to recover the costs over a period of 12 months beginning with the date of implementation of the permitted price increase;(ii) in the calculation of any subsequent price increase under the Code,the &quot;selling price &quot; referred to in paragraph 24 (Hi) should exclude anyclement which represents a recovery of costs under this paragraph ; and(Hi) the costs were allowable cost increases under (lie provisions of the Code, fn force at the time they were incurred.Where the permitted bane date is 30 September 1972. cost-increases first incurred after that date may be takeninto account in determining the permitted price increasebut retrospective recovery of such. cost -: increases must-be limited to costs incurred in the period between30 April 1973 and the date of the price increase.    Aprice increase which includes such an element of recovery of costs may exceed the increase in total costs per unitby the amount necessary to permit the recovery of thosecosts.Calculation of Permitted Price Increase21.   The maximum permitted price increase should be arrived at as follows : (i) calculate the change in total costs per unit and allowable cost increasesper unit (as reduced by the productivity deduction) between the basedate and the date of the price increase; cost increases which have alreadybeen reflected in prices should be excluded;(ii) express allowable cost increases per unit as a percentage of total costs per unit at the base date;(iii) apply the resulting percentage to the selling price at the base date inorder to establish the new permitted price level.In (i), (ii) and (iii) above, &quot;base date &quot; means 30 AprH 1973, or at the option of the enterprise, the date of the last price increase after 30 april-3 197322. The calculation of the level of costs per unit referred to in paragraph 21 (i)should be based on the levels of pay and other costs ruling at the base date and onthe level of output over the most recent representative period completed by thatdate (e.g. the previous quarter) for which adequate records are available. similarly the calculation of costs per unit at the date of the price increase may take account,in accordance with the normal practice of the enterprise, of increases in rawmaterial prices and other allowable cost increases up to the date of the price increase and should reflect the output level achieved in the most recent rcpre-scntative period (e.g. the quarter preceding the date of the price increase).23. The levels of unit costs calculated in this way will not necessarily bethe same as the average figures recorded for the whole of the period chosen,e.g. if pay or other costs changed during the period. If output in the period was materially affected by abnormal factors such as holidays, an appropriateadjustment should be made. If this is impossible, the previous normal operatingperiod should be chosen with appropriate adjustments to allow for changes inthe level of pay or other costs.24. Where price increases are being made not on a single product but ona range of related products (under paragraphs 38 or 39) the procedure inparagraphs 21 to 23 still applies. But in this case the group of related products should be considered as a single product; the costs per unit can be expressed either as costs per unit of volume of output or if a volume measureis impracticable as costs per   of sales value. Where the calculated permittedpercentage price increase is not applied uniformly to the whole range of products,the weighted average percentage price increase made on the selling prices ofthe products within the group may not exceed this percentage.Transitional provision24A. Where an increase in a price or charge was implemented,,while the code set out in the Counter-Inflation (Price and Pay Code) Order 1973 was inforce and was not permissible under that Code, the price or charge in question should be reduced to the level that would have been permitted under that Code, \ ,and this lower price should then be taken as the &quot; selling price at the base date&quot;in calculating any price increase periuiiicu under paragraph 2i of this ^OuC on,. ., ^ . .... I......... t. r   ytort   itii.run.pi;Allowable Cost Increases25.   Subject to the following paragraphs, a cost increase may be regarded asan allowable cost increase for the purpose of paragraph 17 if: (i) it was first incurred after 30 April 1973 ; and(ii) it was incurred for one of the following:  (a) labour;(i) materials, components, consumable stores     and Supplies,   fuel  and power;
m ft   !*T&quot;1   A. 1v ram b        ir- ft, 6  a  b(c) rent of premises and rales:(d) interest charges, as defined in paragraph 28, and depreciation,calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principlesconsistently applied by (lie enterprise concerned;(c) certain boughl-in services, that is: transport, hire of equipment,insurance, storage, postage/, mainlehahce-telepitonc and engineering -services not of a capital Tiature, &apos;    &apos; .&apos;&apos;(/) commission processing and other sub-contracted operations onmaterials or components incorporated into the product; and(iii) it has not already been reflected in prices.Pay not consistent with the Code26. Cost increases arising from increases in pay (as defined in paragraph 103)after 6 November 1972 arc allowable cost increases only to the extent that, as appropriate:  (i) they were consistent with the policies set out in the White PapersCmnd. 5.125 and Cm ml. 5205 (and do not contravene an order ornotice under the Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1972);or(ii) as regards the period after - 1 April 1973, they were consistent with the provisions of the Code in force at the time of the pay increase(and do not contravene an order or notice under the Counter-InflationAct 1973).27. Examples of cost increases which arc not allowable cost increases becausethey arc inconsistent with the Code are:  (i) any part of a pay increase which exceeds the pay limit; or(ii) any part of increases in pay under settlements made at local or plantlevel which, when aggregated with increases under a national agreement,exceeds the pay limit for the group concerned; and(iii) any part of increases in earnings arising from piecework or other pay-,ment by results schemes which exceeds the pay limit,unless the increase was or is specifically exempted fromthe pay limit &quot;by Part II of the. Code; and -(iv) any part of increases in labour costs per unitattributable to payments under new efficiency or...... restructuring-schemes-which is - inconsistent with -the requirements of paragraph .14-9A of the code.&apos;Interest Charges28. Increases in interest charges payable by an enterprise are allowable cost increases, unless the charges or the increases in them:  (i) represent a distribution of profits rather than a true interest charge; or(ii) where they arise on loans between related undertakings, relate to loanswhich are not strictly required for the business or represent interest inexcess of that which would, be charged in a transaction at arm&apos;s length; or(iii) represent interest which would properly be regarded as capital expendi-ture in the period in which it is incurred.Productivity Deduction29. In order to ensure that the benefits of increased productivity are passed on to the consumer, a deduction should be made from allowable cost increases...\ -..  Enterprises are required to absorb50 per cent of allowable cost increases arising from increases in labour costs,with the exclusions listed in paragraph 30, unless the share of labour costs as awhole in their total costs exceeds 35 per cent. In that case enterprises arerequired to absorb only an amount equal to the percentage of total costs whichwould apply if labour costs represented 35 per cent of total costs.27
30.   The deduction for productivity&apos;under paragraph 29 need not be appliedto increases in:  employers&apos; national insurance contributions; training costs; the cost of improvements under paragraph 123 (equal pay), paragraph 134 (recognisedterms and conditions), paragraph 135 (pensions) and paragraph 137(redundancy and incapacity benefits).Safeguard to limit reduction of profit margins30A. (i) Where the effect of one or more of the provisions of the Codelisted in sub-paragraph (ii) below would be to reduce the net profit margin of the enterprise, as defined in paragraphs 53 and 54, bymore than one-tenth below the level in the &quot;representative&apos;period &quot;before either 30 September 1972 orthe base date used in calculating a permittedprice increase in paragraphs 21-23, the enterprise may limit that reduction to one-tenth in calculating permitted price increases for the purposes of the Code.   No account maybe taken of reductions in profit marginsbrought about by reasons other than theprovisions of the Code specified below.(ii) The provisions referred to in sub-paragraph (i) are : (a) paragraph 25 (ii) which determines those cost increases which ranlcas allowable cost increases;(b) paragraph 29 which prescribes the productivity deduction to bemade from certain labour cost increases.(iii) The permitted price increase calculated under sub-paragraph (i) maynot exceed the increase in total costs per unit for the product or range of related products concerned.(iv) This paragraph does not apply where the profit margin reference level is, or is likely to be, exceeded; or where prices are being reduced (or price increases restricted) to eliminate the excess over profit marginreference levels in an earlier period.Allocation of Costs to Controlled Prices31. Allocation of costs to particular controlled goods or services for the calculation of allowable cost increases or increases in total costs may be necessarywhere an enterprise : (i) sells in both home and overseas markets; or(ii) makes sales at home, some of which are within and some outside thescope of the control; or(iii) makes sales of different products or groups of products which are within the control, and has to divide costs between them for the purposesof the Code.Where such an enterprise:- (a) has made allocations which represent a fair division of costs in its circum-stances, over part or all of the field; and(b) has done so on a consistent basis.it should continue to use this basis for all calculations relevant to the Code.In other cases enterprises may make such allocations by dividing costs in proportion to the value of sales in each area, or on any other basis which represents good accounting practice,&apos;provided that it adheres to the chosen basis for all calculations relevant to the Code.Stocks32. In calculating the cost of- current production or sales, enterprises may need to include an element for stocks of raw materials, cf components or of finished goods, used for production or sales. When making such calculationsin order to arrive at costs per unit of output and at any allowable cost increases, enterprises should adhere to the practice they have followed consistentlyfor the treatment of such costs for pricing purposes.. 1&apos; &apos; -&apos;  28; -CONFIDENTIAL.
Transfer Prices : ... .33. Where ihe Price Commission are satisfied that prices, either of purchasesor of sales, which an enterprise proposes to regard as a basis for the calculation of allowable cost increases or of net profit margins, differ from what theywould be if the goods or services had been transferred on an arm&apos;s length basis,they may substitute modified cost increases or profit margins which in theirjudgement fairly reflect what would be appropriate on that basis.Costs of sectors including small enterprises34.   Where the Commission are satisfied that:  (i) significant reductions or increases in allowable costs have occurred or are about to occur in a sector of industry or commerce which includes aconsiderable number of small enterprises, especially those providing services; and(ii) the information available to them indicates that these changes in costs are likely to be of broadly the same order for a substantial number ofsuch enterprises, in respect either of some or all of the goods or services which they supply,the Commission, after consulting any &quot;body or personsthey regard as representative of enterprises affected and after taking into account information supplied by-them, ;may calculate average allowable cost increases or reductionsfor the relevant goods or services. In (he case of cost increases, these increases should then be taken as the allowable cost increases for the relevant goods or services ; in (he case of cost reductions, the Commission may specify reductionsunder paragraph 18 in the prices of (he relevant goods or services which should then be made by all the enterprises concerned.35. In calculating average allowable cost changes under paragraph 34 theCommission will take account of: (i) all relevant information available to them on cost changes for the goodsor services concerned, including information supplied by any trade association or other body which they consider is representative of the enterprises concerned; and(ii) any other relevant provisions of the Code.36. The Commission will publish information about any average allowable cost changes which they have determined under paragraphs 34 and 35 togetherwith an indication of any price changes which they regard as justified or required under the Code on the basis of those average allowable cost changes.37. Where the allowable cost changes of a particular enterprise differ fromthose published by the Commission under paragraph 36, that enterprise may apply the normal provisions of the Code relating to allowable cost increases or price reductions. It will be the responsibility of the enterprise to satisfy theCommission if required that this was justified.Product Costs and Allowable Cost Increases&quot; Single Product &quot; Enterprises38. Where an enterprise makes a single product or a single range of productsthe calculations required by the Code may be carried out by reference to the costs and prices of that enterprise as a whole.. Multi-Product Enterprises :&apos; Related Products39. This paragraph applies to enterprises making a variety of products.Where:  (i) allowable cost increases arise on one or more of a range of related products; and(ii) a price increase in respect of them is permissible under the Code, the &apos;enterprise need not relate the price increase for individual productswithin the range closely to the cost increase for each product, provided29
(a) it has been established practice to treat the range of products in this way;and(Ii) the average increase in price, weighted by the value of sales in a recentperiod, will not exceed the sum of what the Code would permit on the products affected by the cost increases.40. In cases not covered by paragraphs 38 and 39 the calculations requiredby the Code should be made by reference to individual products.Anticipation of Cost Increases42. Prices may not be increased in anticipation of cost increases, except as described in paragraphs 43 to 45.  However:  (i) an enterprise may determine and announce a price increase consistent with the Code which takes account of future allowable cost increases which are already known as to both dale and amount, provided that theprice increase is not implemented before the allowable cost increases areincurred; and(ii) an enterprise required to pre-notify an intended price increase to theCommission may seek the agreement of the Commission to a price increase consistent with the Code which takes account of such knownfuture cost increases, subject to the same proviso as in (i).43.   Where:-(i) a future allowable cost increase is already known, as to both date and amount; and(ii) it is proposed to quote a price for supply on demand which will notbe increased for at least six months from the date on which it takes effect,an enterprise may average the future allowable cost increase over the periodof not less than six months for which it quotes the price in arriving at a price increase for that period, provided that:  (a) the total amount raised will not be increased by the averaging; and(6)-the averaging is in accordance with a well-established practice in the tradeconcerned.44. Paragraph 43 (i) may be read as applying to an estimated future cost increase if:  (i) it relates to a raw material which fluctuates frequently and unpredictablyin price; and(ii) the use of estimates of such cost increases is a well-established practiceof the trade; and(iii) in framing the estimates the enterprise adheres to the methods it has consistently used for the treatment of such costs for pricing purposes.The other conditions of paragraph 43 apply but with references to three monthssubstituted for the references to six months.45. This paragraph applies to tenders to the extent that they are at fixed prices. In framing such tenders, those concerned should have regard to the code, but where tenders are the custom of the trade(i) competitive tenders may provide for estimated future cost increases,(ii) non-competitive tenders may provide for estimated future cost increasesif the contract is to run for at least six months from the date on which work is to begin.Escalation and Variation of^Pjice ClausesPrice increases made under an escalation or variation of price clausemay reflect cost increases for items listed in paragraph 25(ii),provided that this is permissible under.the terms of the clause; butthe productivity deduction specified in paragraph 29 should be appliedto the element relating to labour cost increases, and no price increase should be made in respect of a labour cost increase which was not-consistent with the Code.   Eut if the application of the productivitydeduction causes or increases a loss on a particular   contract, taken as a whole, the terms of the escalation or variation of price clausesmay be applied to the extent necessary to avoid the loss, or theincrease in it.   In addition to new contracts, this paragraph applies to existing contracts and to increase in prices: under those contracts,to the extent that they relate to cost increases after 6 November 1972.
Prime cos! and cost reimbursement contracts46A. Where a claim for payment by a contractor under any form of primecost or cost reimbursement arrangement includes an clement for increased labourcost levels since the start of the contract or since 6 November 1972, whichever islater, the claim for this clement should be made and settled in accordance, withthe following provisions : (i) (he increases in labour cost levels must have been consistent with the(ii) the productivity deduction specified in paragraph 29 must be applied.But if the application of the productivity deduction causes or increases a loss on a particular contract, taken as a whole, (he terms of the contract may beapplied to the extent necessary to avoid the loss, or the increase in if.   Thisparagraph applies to new and existing contracts.4GB.    Paragraph 46A does not apply where the terms of a prime cost or costreimbursement contract ensure that the benefit of economies in the use&quot;of labour pass directly to the client, j For non-competitive contracts of this type placed after 1 November 1973 the contractor may not quotea rate of fee which is higher than that which he has charged since30 April 1973 for the same service or a similar one.460     Where the application of the productivity deduction under paragraph kSor 46A would reduce the net profit margin of the unit for profit margin control as defined in paragraphs 53 and 5k by more thanone-tenth below the level in the representative period, the productivitydeduction may be abated to the extent necessary to limit thatreduction to one-tenth0   The &quot;representative period&quot; means the most recent representative period, completed by 30 September 1972 or30 April 1973 for which adequate records are available.   This paragraphdoes not apply where the profit margin reference level has been or islikely to be exceeded; or where prices are being reduced (or price increases restricted) to eliminate the excess over profit marginreference levels in an earlier period.Code;/
/j-7.   The withdrawal or reduction of a discount or rebate,including a discount or rebate to a particular customer,is equivalent for the purposes of the Code to an increasein the price.   This does not apply, however, to a dis-count or rebate directly related to the promotion of oneor more products or services for a limited period or ina limited area.Quantity or quality change and new products48. A change in the quantity or quality of goods is equivalent for thepurposes of the Code to a change in the price. Quality change in goods or services, quantity change in sales units, or artificial creation of new productsshould not he used as a means of avoiding the requirements of the Code. Wherethe Commission form the opinion that this lias been done, they may seek price reductions, or disallow or reduce price increases.48A.   However, where anew product is marketed!. OB 8D. experimentaland&quot;restricted basis for a period of not more than twelve months,the price charged by the manufacturerneed not be treated for the purposes of the Code asestablishing a price for the product.Losses49. This, paragraph, annlier. to enterprises (as defined in paragraph 13)&quot;which are making a loss, or arc- &apos;     -under the Code at risk of doing so: --- .------(i) where an enterprise is making a loss, it may increase prices to cover itscosts; &apos;(ii) the   provisions   relating   to   allowable  cost   increases   (including   the .productivity deduction) and to increases in total costs need not beapplied to the extent thai they would cause the enterprise to operate at a  loss.Price increases inay not he made under this paragraph if they cause the profit margin reference level referred to in paragraph!,50so2 to be  exceeded.Prices and Profit Margins xi-50.   Prices should be determined so as to secure that net profit margins, as i,&apos;defined in paragraph 51, do not exceed the average level of the best two of (. .&apos;the last five years of account of the unit to which net profit margin control appliesending not later than 30 April 1973 (the &quot;reference level&quot;). K31
51. &quot; Net profit margin &quot; means the margin of net. profit.-expressed &apos;*as avpercentage of sales or-turnover. &quot;Net profit&quot; means the net profit, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied by the enterprise concerned, which arises from trading operations within thecontrol.after taking into account all expenses of conducting and financing them,including depreciaron and interest: . s.S  defined Ahparagraphs 25 and&apos;28, but before deducting Corporation Tax or Income Tax.Action where.Profit Margin is likely to he exceeded &apos;-. *   -52.   Where(i)   the reference level has been exceeded; or(ii)   in the light of interim accounts or otherabatements in allowable cost increases or price reductions should be made; provided that in either case account has been taken of seasonal and otherdistoar-tinjfactors.   The abatements or reductions shouldbe sufficient to eliminate the actual or expected excess over the reference level as soon as reasonably possible,and to offset any excess which has already arisen in aperiod subsequent to 30 April 1973*   Reference levelmeans for any period between 30 April and 31 October 1973the reference level in the Counter-Inflation (Price and pay Code) Order 1973;    and for any subsequent period as defined in this Order.
Unit for Profit Margins53.  In calculating the net profit margin under paragraph 50, the unit forprofit margin control shall be either : (i) the enterprise as a whole; or ...... ........ ...(ii) an activity treated separately under paragraph- 14; or(iii) a unit of an enterprise or of an activitytreated separately under paragraph 14, being in either case a separate constituent company or subdivision,provided that the Commission are satisfied that:(a) the unit reported direct to the main board of the enterprise as a wholebefore 30 April 1973; and(b) it was the practice of the enterprise before 30 April 1973 to treat the unit separately for management and accounting purposes (except where the enterprise has undergone substantial reconstruction since that date); and(c) the accounts of all such units, if combined with one another, can be reconciled with those of the enterprise as a whole; and are not materially distorted by transactions conducted otherwise than onarm&apos;s length terms,The same unit should *...     then be adhered to      &apos; for all the purposes in the Code to whichthe net profit margin is relevant.    -54.   For the purpose of paragraph 53 &quot;the enterpriseas a whole&quot; means the company or (where the company is a member of a group) ail the companies in the groupbut includes only members of the group carrying on business in the United Kingdom; and in this paragraph:-&quot;(i)    &quot;company&quot; includes any body corporate; and(ii)    &quot;group&quot; means the person (including a company)having control of a company together with allcompanies directly or indirectly controlled by him. .Allocation of Profits to Controlled Prices55. Allocation of profits between prices within the control and thosewhich are not may be necessary for the calculation of net profit margins.The requirements of paragraph 31 apply to such allocations of profits as theydo to allocations of costs.
pnKi- ohm i /uP/o/Jf Margins and Indirect Taxes56. In making comparisons between net profit margins as a percentageof sales and the reference level, due account must be taken of the effect onmargins of changes in indirect tax on goods and services sold, so that the comparison is not materially distorted. The comparison with earlier years should be made on a basis which excludes purchase tax from sales in theperiod up to the end of March 1973 and excludes VAT from 1 April 1973onwards. Where excise duties have been included in the sales figures, these duties should be included throughout, adjusted as necessary to lake account of the partial replacement of excise duties by VAT.57. Where an enterprise does not already have accounts showing separatelythe purchase tax element in the turnover of previous years, or which permit the precise calculation of the amount of excise duly abatement from records of duty paid, such elements should, be estimated on the basis of the best available information. Where total purchase lax can be ascertained frompurchase invoices this total can be deducted from tax inclusive sales. where such purchase invoices are not available, the purchase tax element may beestimated by applying to the value of purchases of goods charged to different rates of purchase tax appropriate factors derived from those rates.Modified Base Period for Profit Margin Calculation58. Where an enterprise has traded for- less than five complete years of account, or has traded at a loss in one or more of the last five years, the reference level for paragraph 50 may be calculated as follows:  (i) if there have been four years of trading, the average of the best two;if three or two years, the best year;(ii) if there have been less than two years of trading the limitation onprofit margins will not apply;(iii) any year in which an enterprise made a loss may be treated as equivalent  - o &amp;OX  GO trading   and sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) may be appliedaccordingly.59. For a new enterprise formed from a reconstruction or amalgamation of existing enterprises the reference level will be calculated as defined inparagraph 50 by using the aggregate net trading profits of the constituent enter-prises expressed as a percentage of their aggregate sales. The same principlesmay be applied to an amalgamation of partnerships.
a    r   si    h? $ lr &apos;^ I &quot; *\su60. Where the Commission are satisfied that the reference level 61an enterprise, calculated as in paragraphs 50-54, 58 or 59 requiresmodification, for example because of(i) a substantial reconstruction of the enterprise duringthe base period; or(ii) a substantial change in the character of the business;or(iii) a substantial change in the ratio between the valueof net fixed assets, other than land and buildings, and thevalue of the sales arising from investment which has enabled the enterprise either(a) to undertake an earlier stage of productionof goods or services; or(b) to achieve substantial savings in labour costs per unit of output,may the;/modify the reference level calculated in accordance with,paragraphs 50-59 and paragraphs 61 and 62.   In applying this paragraph the Commission should as far as possible have regard to the profithistory of the main parts of the business which now make up the enterprise; including the profits of any substantial parts of thebusiness acquired or added to the enterprise during the base period,and excluding any such parts which have been disposed of ordiscontinued.
Relief for Low Profits01   Wherc-ibc Commission are satisfied that the net. profit margin-calculated as described in paragraphs 50-54, 58 or 59.represents a return on capital oi less  - ^than 8 per cent, &apos;;&apos;       &quot;the restrictions on price increases and on gross percentage and net profit margins shall not be applied so as to restrict the returnbelow 8 per- cent.   In such eas&amp;t.- the net profit margin -which would be needed to produce a return of 8 per cent on capital may be treated asthe reference level.   Where in the earlier of the two best years rreferred to in paragraph 50 the net profit margin represented a return on capital of less than 8%9 a figure equivalent to an 8 per cent rateof return may be used for that year in&quot;calculating the reference levele&quot;Capital1&apos; means the, net assets employed excluding any part of them which is represented by borrowings the interest on which is deducted in arriving at net profit as defined in paragraph 510
02. At the option of the enterprise paragraph 61 may be read as referring to a net profit margin of \\ per cent on turnover rather than an 8 per centreturn on capital.Investment63. Where the Commission are satisfied that in a particular case it isnecessary in order to encourage or ensure investment to modify the applicationof the provisions rel.at.ing to allowable cost &apos;increases or to increases in total costs or toprofit margins, they may permit some modificationof any of bhose provisionso   In deciding whether,and to what extent, to permit such a departure theCommission should have regard to the followingcriteria:-(i) Whether there is satisfactory evidence that if this done expenditureon the investment will begin within 12 months of the date of the pricebeing increased or the profit margin limit being modified; and(ii) whether(a) the application of the limits would deprive the enterprise of fundsessential for investment which it could not reasonably be expected, or would not be able, to.raise in some other way, or would reduce the prospective rate of return on the investment to a level which woulddeter the enterprise from undertaking it; or(b) there is satisfactory evidence that the enterprise had absorbed cost increases to an exceptional degree as a result of voluntary price restraint and in consequence had significantly reduced profit marginsin the 12 months ending 30 September 1972?* . .
63A. Where the Price Commission are satisfied that(i) an enterprise as defined in paragraphs 53 and 54-has net fixed assets at historic cost&apos;, excluding land and &quot;buildings, per employee v,rhich exceed  2,000 per head; and(ii) has a plant or group of plants and facilities,employed in the manufacture of a group of related products,wMch had a fixed asset value at original cost of at least 10m; and(iii) that the capacity of this plant or group of plantswas seriously under-used at 30 September 1972 or at the base date, as defined in paragraphs 19 and .21; and(iv) that the rate of utilisation has since risen by124- percentage points;the Commission may, on application from the enterprise, modify the calculation of allowable and total costs per unit at the base date by substituting the figures for unit costs that, in the Commission&apos;view, would have applied at that time if the plant had been operatingC \X 3?X* Q Tl &quot;tat the rate of capacity use/at the time of the application.   Where,however, an enterprise has already received approval under thisparagraph for a price increase after 1 November 1973 3 &quot;the date of that price increase shall be substituted for 30 September 1972 or the basedate in sub paragraph (iii).
%-^\-^b&apos;%1 IvJ;i-----i ^8;&quot;*Particular Sectors64. The paragraphs&apos; which follow deal with the application of this Part ofthe Code lo certain important sectors. Unless there is- express provision to thecontrary in those paragraphs, however, paragraphs 3 to 63A must be taken as applying to all enterprises.Manufacturing and Mining65.   Paragraphs 3 to 63A above apply in their entirely.Distribution66. In the determination of prices for sales within the United Kingdom,wholesalers, retailers and other enterprises engaged in distribution should ensurethat their gross percentage margins do net exceed the level of the gross percentagemargin in either(i) the last complete account year of the enterprise ending on or before30 April 1973; or(ii) a 12-monlh period ending between 30 October 1972 and 30 April 1973for which separate accounts are or can be made available,less in either case an appropriate reduction for the abolition of SET.- Where an enterprise has not traded long enough to establish a gross percentage marginunder (i) or (ii), the margin for a complete quarteris trading before 30 April1973 will apply.34
67. For all . the purposes of the Code &quot; gross percentage margin&quot; means the aggregate difference between the cost to the distributor of all the goodshe sells in (he home market in a period--arid the value of his sales of those good!;in that period, expressed as a percentage of the sales value. The differenceshould be calculated according to the normal accounting practice consistentlyapplied by the enterprise. In arriving at sales and costs of sales, indirect taxesshould be treated on the same basis as for calculating net profit margins inparagraph 56.68.   The provisions of the Code relating to allowable cost increases dp notapply to distribution.Distributors&apos; Stocks69. In most cases prices determined by distributive enterprises will have totake account of the cost of goods used from stock for sale. Such enterprisesshould adhere to the practice they have followed consistently for pricing purposes in arriving at such costs and at the relevant gross percentage margins.Distributors making a loss70. Where an enterprise engaged in distribution is making a loss, it may increase prices to cover its costs, notwithstanding the limitation on gross percentage margins. Price increases may not be made under this paragraphif they cause the profit margin reference level referred to in paragraphs 50 tobe exceeded.Action where gross or net percentage margins are likely to be exceeded      - ^71.   Where:-(i)   a distributor1s net profit marginor gross percentage margin has exceeded the level allov/ed underthis Code; or(ii)   where in the light of interim accountsor other evidence, that level is likelyto be exceeded,price reductions should be made; provided that in either case account has been taken of seasonal and other dis-.torting factors.   The reduction should be sufficient to eliminate the actual or expected excess over the permittelevel as soon as reasonably possible, and to offset anyexcess which has already arisen in a period subsequent to30 April 1973.   Reference level has the same meaning asin paragraph 52.
72.  Where in (he judgement of the Price Commission the costs of any goods to wholesalers or retailers rise substantially, they shall: (i) consult any body or person whom they regard as representative ofenterprises affected and take into account all  relevant  information supplied by tliera?(ii) having regard to the situation of the product group as a whole and tothe volume of trade, consider whether the maintenance of existing gross percentage margins would disproportionately increase the net profit -margin on those goods; and whether the trade practice affecting themargins on the products in question therefore requires modification; and(iii) after consultation with.the bodies or persons.....referred to in.sub-paragraph (i). inform them of any reduction in margins which theyconsider appropriate and notify this to anyenterprise.When a reduction in gross percentage margin has beennotified, paragraph 66 in its application to that -enterprise   shall be modified accordingly.Agriculture. t7,3&apos; Pa?

ir-1i IfNationalised industries74.   Paragraphs 75 to 77 apply to the following nationalised industriesNational Coal board electricity CouncilArea Electricity BoardsCentral Electricity Generating board north of Scotland Hydro-Electric board south of Scotland Electricity BoardNorthern Ireland Electricity ServiceBritish Gas corporation british Steel corporation post office British Airways Board ijBritish Airports authority british Railways Board /&apos;British Transport Docks board british Waterways Board
75. Part I of the Code applies to the nationalised industries listed in para-graph 74, according to the nature of the business of the industry, as it applies to private sector undertakings.   However:  (i)   a nationalised, industry may not applyparagraph 49(i).   When in deficit oncontrolled activities it may not increase pricby more than allowable cost increases, calculated without any deductionunder paragraph 29, except to the extent necessary to avoid an increasein its deficit on those activities in the accounting year in question comparedwith the level in 1972-73 or, where it is in accordance with the normalaccounting practice of the industry, in 1972. A nationalised industry may apply this sub-paragraph separately to the deficits of subdivisionsas defined in paragraphs 14 or S3 (iii) even if the industry as a whole isnot in deficit;(ii) as with a private sector enterprise, where an industry is not in deficit, !)the provisions relating to allowable cost increases and to total cost increases (including the productivity deduction) need not be applied tothe extent that they would cause the industry to operate at a loss;(iii) paragraphs 30A and 61-63A will not apply to a nationalised industry.In (i) and (ii) above, a nationalised industry is in deficit if it incurred a deficit on revenue account in the previous accounting year, after providingfor interest and depreciation calculated in accordance with the accountingprinciples consistently applied by the industry concerned.75A. If the operation of a system of multi-part tariffs in the gas and elec-tricity supply industries reduces average revenue per unit the following provisions apply. Whore since the base date the average revenue per unithas fallen faster than average costs per unit, tariffs may he increased by theamount necessary to restore the cash margin per unit of output to the level which applied at the base date. Where since the base date the average revenue per unit has fallen but average costs per unit have risen, the permissible increasein tariffs may include an clement sufficient to restore average revenue per unitto the base date level in addition to an element caleulau-d on the basis ofallowable cost increases. The calculation of permitted tariff increase.&apos;industries should have regard to the likely demand and consumption in the lightof their statutory obligations to meet such demand.76. Where the responsible Minister notifies the Commission that a price increase resulting from the application of paragraph 75 would have an unac-ceptable effect on the general level of prices, the Commission will limit the permitted price increase to the amount specified as acceptable by the Minister,but not so as to reduce the increase below what is needed to reflect the allowable cost increases of the industry   anfl -fco take aCCOUnt,  where  ithas effect , of the provisions of paragraph 75A.
77. The application of the Code is subject to paragraph 78 in the case ofthe National Coal Board and the British Steel Corporation. In the case of thePost Office and those industries concerned with air and sea transport, it is subject to the exclusion from control under paragraph 6 of charges for inter-national traffic. The prices of subsidiary companies of nationalised industries,including subsidiaries of the National Bus Company, National Freight corporation and the Scottish Transport Group, arc governed by paragraph 80(ii). Theprices charged for electricity by Area Electricity Boards and the- ScottishBoards will be subject to the provisions of the Code applying to manufacturers.Coal and Slecl78. Prices charged by producers for coal, coal-based solid fuels, and mostiron and steel products arc outside the scope of the control by virtue ofparagraph 6 (ii). They are subject to international obligations through UnitedKingdom membership of the European Coal and Steel Community. Prices ofnon-ECSC iron and steel products are controlled like those of other manufactured products. Enterprises which produce both ECSC and non-ECSC iron and steel products will be subject to price control on the latter only. Prices of coalmerchants and iron and steel merchants in the United Kingdom will be subjectto the control on gross percentage margins and net profit margins applied towholesaling and retailing enterprises.Other Public Sector Trading Enterprises79. The Commission will apply to proposals for price increases which are referred to them by Government Departments engaged in substantial trading operations the same principles as to proposals by the nationalised industries.80. The Code applies to the prices of the following enterprises, accordingto the nature of the business of the undertaking, as it applies to the prices ofprivate sector enterprises:-(i) trading services of local authorities, local authority joint boards, publicutility undertakings and other similar public sector undertakings (notbeing a nationalised industry listed in paragraph 74); and(ii) companies registered under the Companies Acts which arc wholly or, partly owned by Her Majesty&apos;s Government or by a nationalised industry.Water Undertakings. 81. Statutory water undertakers, whether public or private, arc subject tolimitations on deficits, on surpluses or profits, on profit distributions and onborrowing. They are also required by statute to provide an adequate supply ofwater. Their water rates and charges are already controlled to a large extentthrough these limitations. They will be required to comply with the principlesof the Code and in particular with the paragraphs relating to allowable cost increases, but not so as to conflict with their statutory obligations.Services82. In general, paragraphs 3 to 63 of the Code apply to the prices of service enterprises as they apply to those of manufacturers, so that the system ofallowable cost increases and the limitation on net profit margins as a percentageof sales or turnover apply to them. There will be an offset to allowable cost increases as a result of the abolition of Selective Employment Tax for service enterprises where this has hitherto been paid without refund. Paragraphs 34to 36 permit the Price Commission to calculate average allowable cost changesfor certain small service enterprises where the circumstances are appropriate.
Paragraph 62 would permit service enterprises with low profits to calculate their reference level for the limit on net profit margins by reference cither to turnoveror capital employed. The following paragraphs deal with the application of the code to some particular service sectors, and explain any modifications of thegeneral principles which apply to them.Banks, Finance Houses and Similar Enterprises83. Most banks, finance houses and similar financial enterprises arc engagedpartly in business for which the charge is a rate of interest and partly business for which the charge is of a different nature. Interest charges are not within thecontrol. The other charges of these enterprises, are subject to control. It will therefore be necessary to allocate costs and profits between the two classes ofbusiness for the purpose of the control on non-interest charges. Paragraph 31applies.84. For the purposes of the Code the enterprises described in paragraph 83may treat as goods and services exported :  (i) transactions in sterling with any person or body corporate resident outsidethe United Kingdom ; and(ii) dealings in foreign currencies.85. The provisions of the Code relating to allowable cost increases andto the limitation on net profit margins, defined in the case of these enterprisesas in paragraphs 87 and 88, apply to their non-interest charges. These includecommissions, fees and all similar charges. Where ad valorem rates are chargedand these rates are charged generally, they must be treated as maxima.Enterprises will, however, be free to adjust their rates to match the creditstatus of a client provided such adjustments are in accordance with normal practice in such cases. In calculating charges these enterprises should take fully into account all factors including customers&apos; balances which enter the costing of the class of transaction for which the charge is made. They should treatchanges in those factors as the basis for increases or reductions in the charges in accordance with the Code.86. The provisions of the Code will apply in full to charges in hire purchase, conditional sale and plant and machinery leasing agreements. Changesin the monthly Finance Houses Base Rate may be taken as the measure of increases or reductions in interest costs for the calculation of allowable cost increases, provided that rate is used consistently for all the purposes of the code.87.   For the purposes of paragraph 50 &quot; net profit margin &quot; means:  (i) in the case of enterprises undertaking hire purchase, conditional sale or plant and machinery leasing contracts, where either the greater partof the business of the enterprise consists of such contracts, or separateaccounts can be produced for such contracts, net income from charges for this business less associated costs, including overheads, expressed as a proportion of average resources employed.(ii) in the case of all other enterprises of the kind described in paragraph83 net income from charges (that is, gross income less costs, includingassociated overheads) expressed as a percentage of gross income (that is,total income from the transactions concerned).88. In comparing net profit margins, as defined in paragraph 87, with the reference level, account should be taken of the total profitability of the non-interest business of the enterprise concerned in determining the permitted levelof charges.Construction89. In determining prices for construction contracts enterprises should haveregard to the Code as it applies to manufacturing enterprises.   Of particular38
relevance to construction arc paragraph 45, which applies to tenders for con-slruclion work to the extent that they arc at fixed prices, paragraph 46, which applies to variation of price clauses in construction contracts and paragraph 46A,which applies to priirte.eps! rind cost reimbursement arrangements.Transport90. The Code applies to transport undertakings as i! docs to other service enterprises. Charges for international freight and passenger traffic are outsidethe control under paragraph 6 (yi). Charges of nationalised transport under-takings, passenger transport authorities, local authority transport undertakings and transport companies owned by nationalised industries and their subsidiariesare governed by paragraphs 74-77 and 80.91. Charges of private road haulage undertakings arc subject to theprovisions relating to allowable cost increases and to the limitations on net profit margins.Vehicle Sales and Services92. Charges for repair, maintenance and servicing of vehicles are subjectto the provisions relating to allowable cost increases and to the limitation on net profit margins. The prices of vehicles sold by distributors, whethernew or second-hand, arc subject to the limitations on gross percentage marginsand on net profit margins. Paragraph 14 applies to enterprises which bothsell and maintain vehicles.Hotel&apos; and Catering Enterprises93. What is said in paragraph 82 applies to these enterprises also, inrespect both of charges for food and drink and for accommodation.Professional or other Services94. Fees and charges for professional or other services by firms or by individuals who are self-employed are governed as prices by Part I. In general,what is,said in paragraph 82 applies to them. The pay of professional staff who arc employees is however governed by Part II, as is the remuneration from public funds of doctors and dentists.i
^AMC^nLlV! 11 Al95. Where scales or rates of charges- of general application, whethercalculated per item, at an hourly rate or ad valorem, arc in use in a professionunder instructions or advice issued by a professional organisation, those scalesor rales must be treated as maxima and may not be increased without theagreement of the Commission. Where rales above scale have normally been; agreed and have become normal charges, such rales need not be reduced butthe margin by which such rales exceed the scale may not be increased. TheCommission will apply the provisions relating to allowable cost increases to increases in scales or rates,,    &quot;those provisions will also apply to increases infees or charges&apos; calculated on a time &quot;basis, exceptthat the productivity deduction in paragraph 29need not be applied where the fee or charge reflectsonly   the labour cost of any employees&apos;time.%. Whcic there are no scales or rales of general application,, the rales orscales charged for a profession:&apos;I service may no! be increased except lo reflectincreases it! allowable costs. Increases in labour ousts undei paragraph 25 Cii) Ui)may not include any element in respect of proprietors&apos; or parinei-s&quot;, ,.s distinct from employees&apos;, time.97. The limitation on net. profit margins will apply to profits of firms or individuals providing professional or other services irrespective of themethod by which fees arc determined. Where the number of partners in a professional practice has changed as a result of the substitution of a partnerfor an employee, or of an employee for a partner, fhe reference level may berecalculated by reference to the changed number of partners. Paragraph 59applies to amalgamations of partnerships. In applying the provisions relatingto allowable cost increases to scales or rates of charges, the Commission will have&quot;regard to profit margins in the profession generally and will apply paragraphs30A, 32? and 61-62 as necessary.
W WI is ^ t [^ *****N,pn-i&apos;i;oln-intikiug Organisations9N.   Subscriptions charged by organisations which : &apos;(i) e.\ist for religious, charitable, educational, representational or recreationalpurposes; and(ii) a:j non-profit-making; and(iiij do not carry on a trade or business as their main activity, will not be controlled,99. The Code will not apply to prices charged by an organisation satisfying the tests in paragraph 98, or by any properly authorised person acting onbehalf of that organisation, if they are charged in order to raise funds for thepurposes of the organisation, and involve no substantial or continuing corn-petition with trading enterprises.100. Except where they arc outside the control under paragraph 99, prices charged&apos; in any trading activity carried on by an organisation which meets therequirements of paragraph 98 arc governed by the Code, unless the customersof the tiading activity arc conlined to members of the organi^iiticn.
Part II-PayGenera! Principles101.   The general principles relating to pay are:  (i) to limit the rate of increase in pay in money terms to a level more in line with the growth of national output, so as progressively to reduce the rateof cost and price inflation and improve the prospects of sustained faster growth in real earnings;(ii) to apply the limit fairly, irrespective of the form of any increase or the methodof determining it, while providing for the remedying of anomalies;(iii) to facilitate an improvement in the relative position of the low paid;(iv) to leave to those who normally determine pay decisions on the amount,form and distribution of increases within the limit;(v) to encourage the better use of productive resources.Field of Application102.   Part II of the Code applies to :-(i) all pay including wages and salaries at whatever level, allowances, pay-commitments  by results, payments in kind, fringe benefits and lump sums;(ii) all methods of determining pay whether at national, local, plant or anyother level; and whether determined by collective bargaining, by arbitra-tion, by statutory wage fixing bodies, on an individual basis, or by other means; and(iii) all types of employment (except self-employment covered in Part 1); andto both full-time and part-time employees in whatever size of under-taking.All those concerned with the determination of pay should have regard to the103. Throughout the Code &quot;pay&quot; means remuneration (except self-employ-rnent incomes covered in Part I), including other terms and conditions ofemployment.104. References throughout the Code to &quot;settlement&quot; include references tothe determination of pay by any method.105. Where the Code refers to a group, the group will normally be the sameas that used for the purpose of determining pay in the preceding 12 months. Itwill, however, remain open to those concerned to vary the composition of theirgroups. Where pay is fixed on an individual basis, the Code applies to theindividual as to the group.Intervals between Increases106. No group may receive an increase in pay under a settlement made after 6 November 1972 less than 12 months after the group last received a principal increase.107.   Paragraph 106 does not apply where:  (i) an earlier date for such an increase was specified (other than by referenceto changes in indices or rates of pay for other groups) in a previoussettlement made before 6 November 1972; or(ii) the last increase was deferred as a result of the standstill under theWhite Paper (Cmnd. 5125), in which case the 12 months may countfrom the date from which the last increase would have operated but forthe standstill;Code.
(iii) the increase does not count against the pay limit or is covered by paragraph 121A (flexibility margin). (Paragraphs 120A premium payments), 121B (flexibility margin), 149B (new efficiency payments schemes), and 152E (certain anomalies) contain special rules about timing in these cases).

(iv) the increase supplements a Wages Council settlement coming into operation on or after 7 November 1973 but reached before that date, and brings minimum rates into line with the provisions of this Code.

108. Pay increases which consist solely of one or more improvements of the kind described in paragraph 107(iii) and (iv) are not principal increases for the purpose of paragraph 106.

The Pay Limit

109. The pay limit for a group represents the maximum amount by which the average pay bill per head of the group may be increased in a 12-month period. This amount is either 7 per cent of the average pay bill per head of the group for the preceding 12-month period or £2.25 per week per head. Negotiators and others concerned with pay determination may choose which of these limits to apply, but whichever limit is chosen will be applied to the whole of the group.

(109A placed after 118A)

109B. A precise method of calculating the pay limit of 7 per cent is set out in paragraph 117. If insufficient information is available for this, the best available alternative method should be used; examples are given in paragraph 118. Those concerned will be responsible for satisfying the Pay Board, if required, that the method used is the best available. The method of calculating the pay limit of £2.25 per head is set out in paragraph 118A.

110. Subject to the individual limit in paragraph 121, it will be for negotiators and others concerned with pay determination to decide on the amount and distribution of increases within the pay limit, and on the division between increases in wages or salaries and improvements in other conditions of service. They should, however, have full regard to the objective of improving the relative position of the low paid.


111.  The pay limit applies lo the .12 months following the first increase&apos; which counts against Vi\     &quot;  &apos; -. . &apos; &apos;112.   Subject only to the exceptions specified in this- Ca&amp;Qt the pay limit applies to the total of all pay increases for the group --including, improvements in terms and conditionsof employment other than wages and.salaries, in respect ofthe 12-month&apos;period in question-, irrespective of- Whether theyare. paid during that period or at.a later dafce*   However,increases in employers&quot; contributions in respect of their employees for national insurance; selective employment tax,pensions schemes andre^ct&amp;contingency payment schemes- and (subject to para-graphs 119 end 120) the cost of overtime hours actually worked willnot count against the pay limits(112 placed under new heading &quot;Payments for Periods before7 November 1973&quot; below)Calculation of the Pay Limit117.   A precise calculation of the pay limit of 7 per cent should be madeas follows:(i) determine under paragraph 105 the group to be covered by the settle-ment; ...................        ..........(ii)   ascertain the total pay bill including all forms of pay as defined in paragraph 103 for that group over the 12 monthspreceding the operative date.   Where the operative date ofa principal increase was deferred by the standstill, theaverage pay bill over the previous 12 months may be calculated as if the increase had been paid from the due date*Ciii) exclude payments for non^contractual-:Overtime working, and employers&apos; contributions in respect, of their employees for pensions and redundancy payment schemes, national insurance and selective employment taxi   and adjust to offset the effectof absences from work due to absenteeism, sickness, short time working or to stoppages from any other cause;(iv) divide by the average-number of workers in the group over the12 months preceding the operative date.   Part time workers should be counted according to the proportion which theirhoure bear to the standard hours of the group, as defined inparagraph 120.CONFIDENTIAL
*W 8   ^fe    Hfo^ 6a.ft   m  h  E /?    * bagThis gives the. average pay bill per head over the previous year, less overtime.Next:(v) take 7 per cent of that and divide by 52 for a weekly basis or 12 fora monthly basis.This gives the maximum increase in the weekly or monthly pay bill per head allowablewithin the pay liiuii for the group for the next 12 Months.118.   It may not always be necessary to carry out this calculation in full.For example:(i) where rates of pay are equal, or nearly equal, to earnings (excludingovertime), it may be convenient to calculate the pay limit by adding7 per ccni to rates. The cost of any other improvements in pay which count against the pay limit would then need to be calculated separately and the new rate reduced commcnsurately;(ii) in other cases it may be possible to base the calculation on a typicalsample period of e.g. one month or one quarter or on typical sampleperiods for different parts of the year.3I8A. Where the alternative pay limit of  2-25 per head is chosen the maximumincrease in the weekly pay hill allowable within the pay limit for the group is calculatedsimply by multiplying  2-2-5 by the number currently in the group.Fart time workers should be counted according to the proportionwhioh their hours; &quot;bear to the standard hours of -the group as defined in paragraph 120c(118B placed under new heading &quot;Occasional Work&quot; below)109A   Where a groups(*) the same pay structure as one other clearlyidentified groupf   and(ii)   before 6 KovenYbsr &quot;3972 has regularly received byautomatic application and without further negotiation,the same ^absoluto^^^j^^entage jJJi9r_5a.se,jln^rates^^. jjgy as that group;it may receive (in place of any increase vihioh counts against the pay limit in its case) the same absolute or percentajr^Jjr^^of pay as that group receives wj^^i&quot; its pay limit under the provisions in this CodeeNational, Local and Plant Increases143. Where settlements or pay determinations for a particular group are concluded at more than one level (for example a settlement at national or industrylevel is supplemented by settlements at local or plant level) the pay limit will apply for the 12 months beginning with the first increase which counts    against in the  maximum increase: in the weekly or monthly pay bill per head allowable within the pay limit for the group for that 12 months should be as inparagraph 117 / Paragraph 106 applies separately to each level of settlement.144. When local or plant negotiations take place before national negotiations the recommended method of achieving the purpose of paragiaph 143 is by including in the local or plant settlements an off-setting provision precluding employers from making subsequent payments as a result of a national agreement which would resultin a total increase in the pay of the group concerned in excess of the pay limit. Thoseundertaking national negotiations should have regard to the requirement that any increase settled nationally if not offset as above should be taken into account in any subsequent local or plant negotiation so as to ensure that the maximum increase in the weekly or monthly pay bill per head of t^group concerned docs not exceed the pay limit for that group.
152A. Any increase may be paid which could, consistently with the require-ments of the Counter-Inflation (i&apos;rice and Pay Code) Order 1973, be paid with effect from a date before 7 November 1973.113. No payment should be made after 6 November 1973 in resnecf orperiods before that date if the effect would be to circumvent the retirementsof the the White Papers Cmnd. 5125 (A Programme for Controlling Inflation-The 6,irst Stage), Cnnul. 5205 (The Programme for Controlling Inflation - Tfi-Second Stage), and The Counter-Inflation (Price and Pay Code) Order 1973^If any group receives after 6 November 1973 an increase inreapeot of an earlier period which if paid before thenwould Kavg been inoongi^ten-tTwith tboS  m^iK&amp;mcoal^-Bucb.-.an increase will ooxmt against the pay limit. to. the extanttbat it has not already1 been offset- agaj.nst the pay j imitapplying in the periobefore 7Jfeygfo.6]?

Overtime,. Shift, Night, Rest:Day and Weekend Working119. All payments for work done in normal working hours within the meaning of Schedule 2 to the Contracts of Employment Act 1972 (which broadly includes anyhours paid at overtime rates which the employee is required to work under the termsof his contract) should be included in the pay bill. The effect on such payments of any improvement in pay will count against the pay limit, save as provided inparagraphs 120A to 120D below.120. If there is any widening of the percentage differential bciween the rate of pay for work done outside normal working hours (for example overtime, rest day orweekend working) and the effective rate of pay for standard hours (for. example, if the overtime multiplier is increased from time-and-a-third to time-and-a-half), theadditional cost will count against the pay limit, save as provMed in paragraphs 120Ato 120D below. For this piirpo.se standard working hours are those recognised either by collective agreement or by custom and practice as being those beyond which overtimepayments . &apos;are payeblS&apos; In calculating the cost it should be assumed that the amount of such working in the 12 months from the operative date of thesettlement will be at least as much as in the preceding 12 months.-

They will count against the pay limit unless theyare increases of a kind which do not count against the pay limit under other paragraphs of this Code.151. In the case of an increase under a settlement of the kind referred toin paragraph IS!) the pay limit will apply to the 12 months following thatincrease, except where the increase falls within the period of a previous pay limit for the group and is counted against it.

Reductions in standard working hours (as defined inparagraph 150)may be made outside the pay limitif they reduce standard working hours to not less than 40 hours a week, net of mealbreaks. This does not apply where standard working hours have at any time been increased by agreement to more than 40 a week.126. Reductions in standard working hours (as deffinedlinparagraph 120)other than as provided for inparagraph 125 count against the pay limit. The true cost should be set againstthe pay limit but the cost should not be treated as less than proportional to thereduction (so that for example a reduction of one hour in 40 should be treatedas equivalent to not less than a 2-1- per cent increase in pay) except where theBoard is satisfied in the light of the evidence that the true cost is less.HOLIDAYS127A. The cost of an additional holiday on 1 January (or an alternativeday in Scotland) docs not count against the pay limit.improvements.127- Other J in holidays do not count against the pay limit unless theyincrease the total holidays for any group to more than the equivalent of threeweeks a year excluding:  (i) up to seven occasional or public holidays including 1 January;(ii) rest days taken in lieu of weekends and overtime;(iii) rest days granted before 6 November 1972 in lieu of a shorter working week.128. Improvements in holidays other than as provided for in paragraph 127 and 127Acount against the pay limit. The true cost should be set against the pay limit but thecost should not be treated as less than proportional to the increase (so that for examplean increase of one day per year should he treated as equivalent to not less than a 0-4 percent increase in pay) except where the Pay Board is satisfied in the light of the evidencethat the true cost is less.
&apos;ersonal Increments129.   Except as in paragraph 130, where personal increments:  (i) are. part of a pre-detcrmined range or scale ; and(ii) conform to defined principles and practice which before 6 November1972 governed the exercise of any management discretion in individual cases; and(iii) do not exceed those paid in similar circumstances in previous years bymore than results directly from any improvement to the range or scale which lias been made within the pay limit and counted against it,any net addition to the annual pay bill per head for the group concerned willnot count against the pay limit. Increments which satisfy these conditions donot count against the limit of  350 a year for the individual.130. The following count against the pay limit and against the individuallimit of  359 :-(i) improvements in the ranges or scales in incremental systems covered by paragraph 129;(ii) any net addition to the annual pay bill of a group resulting from thepayment of types of personal increment other than those in paragraph129; and f   .(iii) any element in personal increments which relates to factors not personalto the individual concerned, such as cost of living increases or companyprofits (other than under a profit-sharing scheme as it existed before November 1972).Promotion and Regrading131. Increases commensurate with greater responsibility may be given outsidethe pay limit to individuals who are promoted or the level of whose work isreassessed by the application of procedures and criteria established before November 1972. Where this test is not satisfied any increase in pay countsagainst the pay limit and against the individual limit of  350. Artificialregrading and changes of job specification should not be used as a means of avoiding the provisions of the Code.Recruitment and New Work132. New recruits to existing jobs should not be paid more than those theyreplace or more than is currently pail by the employer concerned for thes*iinc job.133   The pay for new work should not be more than the currentjmy; for the same or most nearly similar work by the same orother employers8   Where pay varies in different localities, the pay for new -work should not be more than the pay in the samelocalityo133A. Where before the statutory reorganisation of public services oil 1 April 1974(16 May 1975 for local government in Scotland) an individual temporarily undertakeswork appertaining to the establishment and functions of a new authority or authorities which: (i) is additional to and wider in scope than his continuing work with his currentemployer;(ii) involves additional hours (not subject to overtime payment) or additionalresponsibility; and,(iii) continues lor a period not less than three months.-&apos;Payment may be made outside the pey limit foje^uoh-wopk-afterOTovember 1973 ajrL(^- during the period concerned provided thatthe payments do not exceed those allowable for new work inaccordance with paragraph 133?
Recognised Terms and Conditions134. The cost of increases to meet the purposes of Section 8 of the terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959, the Road Haulage Wages Act 1938and similar legislation, and the Fair Wages Resolution-of 1946 will not count against the pay limit.Pensions.135. New or improved benefits under occupational pension or death benefitschemes which are tax approved, or under comparable schemes not requiringtax approval, and any reimbursement of a corresponding increase in employeecontributions may, unless paragraph 136 applies, be given outside the pay limit.136. Where a change in a pension scheme has the effect of increasing the pay, net of any pension contribution of a substantial proportion of the group of employees covered by the scheme, that increase counts against the pay limitunless:  (i) a revaluation of the scheme, made in accordance with generally acceptedprinciples for such revaluations, has shown a surplus in respect of thosereceiving the increase, the value of which equals or exceeds theincrease; or(ii) there has been a corresponding reduction in benefits to those receiving the increase; or(iii) the change had been proposed before 6 November 1972.Redundancy Payments137.   New or improved benefits under schemes which(i) provide payments to employees who leave an employees service or are redeployed  to a job with lower earningsbecause of redundancy in the circumstances described in (a) and (b) of Section i (2) cf the Redundancy Payments Act 1965,and(ii) require a minimum of at least 52 weeks continuous service as a condition of such payments,are outside the pay limit, as are benefits which become payable after six monthsof incapacity.

The terms ofschemes under which shares already issued are still subject to restrictions, oroptions already granted remain unexerciscd, may not be improved.140. The acquisition of shares through any arrangements, not involvingoptions, by which employers facilitate the purchase of shares by employees is outside the pay limit provided that:(i) the shares are purchased at a price equal to their market value (themarket value being assessed without regard to any restrictions attachedto the shares, or to the employees rights as a shareholder, which do notattach to all shares of the same class, or to the rights of all shareholders);and(ii) there are no related loans or deferred payment arrangements.Other Benefits141. The cost of any new benefits and of any improvement or extensionof existing benefits or other terms and conditions of service will count againstthe pay limit unless otherwise exempted in the Code.   These benefits include :Benefits in cash or kind, including the provision of cars partly or whollyfor private use, living accommodation at less than economic cost, etc.

Increases in pay under a scheme oT payment by results, including pieceworkand commission payments, or under an arrangement linked to such a scheme will not count against the pay limit where they arise, under the terms of a scheme which was inoperation before 6 November 1972 or brought into operation under the provisions ofparagraph 149, from the direct and measurable contributions by tire employees to increased output. After 1 July J974, this provision will apply only where (he operationof the scheme is kept under review by thel49A -JISiSYJili control information specified in paragraph147.  For those covered by schemes of payment by results, who do not benefitrom a general pay increase, the 12-month period referred to in paragraph 109 will bethe 12 months from 1 April in the relevant year.148. For those covered by schemes of payment by results who also benefit from a general increase which counts against the pay limit, account must betaken in calculating the amount available for the general increase of any increase under the scheme which counts against the pay limit. For this purpose it mustbe assumed that increases in pay which count against the pay limit arising underthe scheme during the 12 months following the general increase will be at least as great in percentage terms as in the preceding 12 months.Programmes agreed and partially implemented before 6 November 1972.149.   Where :-(i) there was on 6 November, 1972, an agreement to implement a programmeof productivity (including payment by results) schemes, or a restructuring,for specified groups of employees in which the amount of pay or the precise method by which it was to be calculated was clearly specified,leaving only the practical details of application of the scheme to particular groups to be settled; and(ii) the employer or group of employers covered by the agreement had on6 November, 1972, already implemented the programme in respect ofsome of the employees concerned,implementation of the programme in respect of the specified groups may proceed.Resultant increases in pay will not count against the pay limit, provided those arisingfrom payment by results schemes meet the requirement of paragraph 146.

New Schemes

149A. Increases in pay resulting from efficiency payment schemes (including a payment by results or restructuring schemes) will not count against the pay limit provided that the scheme meets the following criteria:-

(i) the net savings arising from the scheme are

(a) sufficient to reduce unit total costs and unit labour costs below the level they would be but for the introduction of the scheme, and

(b) at least equal to the cost of the direct and consequential pay increases under the scheme;

For this purpose net savings mean savings after meeting all costs and charges incurred by the employer in installing and maintaining the scheme (including pay increases to all employees benefiting under the scheme, whether directly or consequentially and, where appropriate an element for increased capital costs determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied by him.

(ii) The Pay Board is informed of the basis and provisions of the scheme before it is brought into operation;

(iii) no increase is payable before the net savings have been achieved at the required rate and in any case not until after the results of the first three months running of the scheme have been submitted to the Pay Board for checking and the Board&apos;s approval given for payment to be made with effect from the date of operation of the scheme;

(iv) the additional payments under the scheme do not exceed 50 per cent of the increase within the pay limit (excluding the flexibility margin)to those benefiting directly or consequentially under the scheme;

(v) the additional payments under the scheme are to be correspondingly reduced if standards or targets specified in the scheme are not met;

(vi)(a) in the case of a payment by results scheme it is based on properly measured work standards, not merely on past performance, and includes provisions which:-

(i) take account of the improvement in performance which experience of doing a particular job brings; and

(ii) require standards to be regularly checked and revised when any relevant change occurs to ensure that consistency is maintained; and

(iii) directly relate changes in pay to the measured contributions by the employees to changes in output;

(b) in the case of any other type of scheme it is based on relevant indices of performance that:-

(i) are established through the application of either generally accepted methods of work measurement or, where these cannot be applied, other generally accepted methods of assessment; and

(ii) clearly indicate the contribution of employees to changes in levels of efficiency; and

(iii) measure the costs of the scheme and any financial gains attributable to the employees&apos; contributions;


(vii) the operation of tha sshese is kept under review through regularwBxgimmxit control inferm&amp;determination    The control information -must* as- a /ministv xnd3.cat.o cnanses :o.i oiM^Sf^-JlLiik^^ related earningunit total costs and mat labour &quot;cosTrrelafea^T^repi-escntative -eariJwreference perxod.

AnomaliesJ52C. Subject in all cases to approval by the Pay Board, increases may be givenoutside the pay-limit as necessary in order to correct anomalies satisfying the relevantcriteria set out in paragraphs 152D, 152F, IS2G or I52H. Such increases may bebackdated to 7- November 1973 but not earlier.152D.   In order to qualify as mi anomaly on the basis of a link: (a) the link must have been broken by the standstill; and(6) but for the standstill, the link must have determined the pay of the group concerned.In order to satisfy this condition:(i) there must be evidence of that link and clear identification of the pay groupbeing followed; and(ii) the effect of the&apos;Jink on the pay of the group concerned must have been known(even if not formally agreed) before 6 November 1972 or have been predictablewithin a narrow range;and where applicable:(iii) where the link is net embodied in a formal agreement and there are separatenegotiations, there must be evidence that&apos; all concerned intended that the outcome would be in accordance with (ii).These requirements apply to links both between groups and between grades within thesame or different groups.J 52E. When a link which meets the conditions in paragraph I52B is restored with a group which had negotiated before the standstill a long-term settlement providing forone or mere pay increases or improvements in condifions after the end of the standstill,the linked group may apply such increases or improvements:(i) on 7 November 1973, where they were effective between the end of flic stand still and 6 November 1973;(ii) on the operative date for applying the increase or improvement of flie group being followed,where this is later than 6 November 1973.152F.   In order to qualify as an anomaly on the basis of a formal procedure: (ri) the formal procedure must have been set aside by the standstill; and(b) but for the standstill the formal procedure must have determined the pay of thegroup concerned.   In order to satisfy this condition:-(i) there must be a process agreed between the parlies for determining the field of comparisons which cannot be changed during the course of a particularpay review; and(ii) there must be agreed rules governing the translation of external rates intoagreed internal levels of pay such that it is possible to infer the outcomefrom the external evidence within a narrow range. The procedure mustdetermine the actual levels of pay and not merely use outside evidence, forexample published wages or earnings indices, to gauge the size of increases.152G      Where a group is covered &quot;by the same formal procedure as^group which&apos; qualTfies&apos; as^an^anomaly under paragraph and the_.pro^e^ri&quot;fo^fHi^^er grougs was in operation before the standstill,- ajfreview -.dat:e.*raSi;eF&apos;-KJie^nd&quot; of the standstill and includes within its current review a period before the standstill, any increase for thatgroupwinch may be due at the first review following the standstillmay be paid in full on the first due date after 6 November 1973 in place of an increase under paragraph 109.V--* S  V8    i army issx&amp;     .  5   t      fefasa
152H. Where a new anomaly is created when a link or formal procedure is restored in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 152D, 152F or I52G above, theeonscciaentiiil anomaly may also be treated as an anomaly arising from the standstillprovided that it meets conditions       (i) to (iii) of paragraph 152D above.1521.   Increases designed to remedy an anomaly must:(i) be limited to what the link or formal procedure would have given if the link orformal procedure had been allowed to operate at the first operative date after November 1972;(ii) fake full account of all relevant details of the settlement or procedure being followed and of benefits received by the linked group since 6 November 1972in so far as these are relevant to the benefits accruing from the restoration of the link or formal procedure; and(iii) for those whose basic pay exceeds  5,000 per annum, be staged and paid in twoequal amounts, subject to such modifications as the Fay Board may approvein order ro prevent this provision creating serious anomalies in the pay structure of the group concerned. The first payment may be made with effect from a datenot earlier than 7 November 1973, and the second not earlier than 12 monthsafter tire first payment,152J. For the purpose of calculating the pay limit for the next increase after the remedy of an anomaly, the calculations required by paragraph 109 may take accountof increases in the pay bill expressed as an annual rate, resulting from the remedy ofthe anomaly.152K. In determining increases remedying anomalies negotiators should haveregard to the objective, set out in paragraph 110, of improving the relative position ofthe low-paid and to the desirability, therefore, of not reversing any redistribution of income from higher paid to lower paid employees. resulting from increases since6 November 1972.Part III-General153. Where the particular provisions of the Code cannot be directly appliedto particular cases or sectors without modification, the Price Commission andthe Pay Board will, in exercising their functions, apply those provisions with suchadaptations or modifications as appear to them to be necessary to give effect tothe principles and objectives of the Code.EXPLANATORY NOTE(This Note is not part of the Order.)This Order substitutes a new Frice and Pay Code for the Price and Pay Code made on1st April 1973*   ^he substitution takes effect as respects prices and charges on1st November, and as respects pay on 7th November, 1973o
