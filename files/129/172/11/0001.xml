THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 111 COPY NO      g723 October 1973CABINETRATE SUPPORT GRANTLOCAL AUTHORITY EXPENDITURE IN 1974-75(ENGLAND AND WALSS)Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. The normal pattern of the rate support grant settlement is that officials discuss this with the local authorities in October, and Ministersmake proposals in early November and then settle on the total at thestatutory meeting on 27 November.    We therefore have to take a view oftheir current expenditure next year, which in turn cannot be separated from what is to happcra to grants and rates then.    The decisions on thetotal of public expenditure in the years up to 1977-78 have to be consistent with what we decide about local authority expenditure in1974-75.    I now seek my colleagues&apos; views on the way in which weshould approach the level of rate support grant, taking into account thepublic expenditure implications and the impact that the changes in rateburdens will have on Stage 3 of our Counter-Inflation policies.2. We now have the preliminary reports of the joint studies between departments and local authorities.    These indicate forecast figures for expenditure for 1974-75 in excess of those in last year!s public expenditure White Paper; in public   expenditure terms the gap between these latest forecasts and the 1973 PESC Survey plus running tallyadjustments (which take into account the Governments May cuts of 81 million) is about  140 million.    (The Annexes, which are consistent with this figure, are in terms of relevant expenditure - thebasis used in the grant settlement. )3. We cannot control local authority current expenditure directly.It is not like capital expenditure where central Government doesexercise a direct control through approving starts of school buildings,loan sanctions etc.    Local authorities were formally warned following the May announcement that there would have to be restraint in thegrowth of expenditure, and that this year&apos;s rate support grant negotiations would proceed on the basis that the cuts of   81 million were achieved.    The policy implications of achieving cuts of  81 millionare set out in the latest reports from Departments and local authorities:1 f ;
but further savings would require further policy changes, for example on what we urge local authorities to do about numbers of teachers, making provision for the mentally ill or handicapped, and providing environmental services.    If we restrict the rate of grant we can expect local resistance to large increases in rates to act to some extent as a regulator on totalexpenditure.    But we have for some time sheltered the domestic ratepayerfrom the full consequences of rising local expenditure through progressiveincreases in rate support grant.    I do not believe that we can stop doing this now since it is an essential element in our counter-inflation policies to moderate rises in rates.4. It seems to me that there are three basic courses open to us.(These are set out in tabular form in Annex III) -a. To go back on what we said in May, accept that the cutsare not enforceable, and take the view that they are not likely to be achieved.    This would mean accepting the latest estimate - itself subject to further revision and discussion -of what Departments and local authorities think will happen to services without such cuts.    The resulting total local current expenditure (even after allowing for the transfers out explained in Annex I) will still be some 4 per cent above this year in constant price terms.    Local authorities have already rated for 1973-74.Assuming that they allow for an increase in costs of about  per cent in 1974-75 over 1973-74 (in line with Stage 3) and also for an increase of Z\ per cent in the rateable base, then average rate burdens would increase in 1974-75 by about 10 per cent.(Last year&apos;s grant percentage of 60 per cent is not comparablebecause of the loss of local authority functions and reviseddefinition of relevant expenditure. )   A grant percentage of61 per cent would help keep the increase in average rate burdensto 7 per cent (the threshold limit for Stage 3):  60. 3 per cent would help keep it to 9 per cent in line with increases in localauthorities&apos; costs (see Annex III, column a).b. To say that local authority expenditure ought to be held to a, .      figure equivalent to Cmnd 5178 less the  81 million.Departments are agreed that exhortations to hold expenditure tothis figure will not be effective unless the Ministers concernedannounce the curtailment of present policies for their programmes,and there is no guarantee that this would have sufficient effect in1974-75,    But there would nevertheless be some effect if theGovernment announced that it would not accept expenditure of morethan the Cmnd 5179 figure less  81 million and would restrict grantaccordingly.    The local authorities would not observe this requestexactly:  they can always adjust their rate calls to allow themselvesfinance for a more ambitious programme.    But the effect of the government&apos;s action as set oui above on local authority expendituremight be to lead to an increase in rate burdens oi about 11 per centaoauming 60 per cent grant (sea Annex III, column b. )   The range of possible effects on rate burdens, and on a It es native assumptions about policy curtailment is shown in Annex IV.2
c.    To accept that without Government pressure the localauthorities are indeed likely to spend about the amount in thelatest forecast, but seek to ensure that they do in fact securethe cuts of  81 million.    This would still mean expenditureabove the Cmnd. 5178 base, but would imply an increase inrate burdens of only some 8 per cent with a 60 per cent grant,though this could be limited to 7 per cent or allowed to increase to 9 per cent by varying the grant percentage, as set out in annex III, column c.    However if the savings of  81 million were not realised in practice, the increase in rates could be some 13 per cent instead of 9 per cent.conclusion. The basic choice is between a low forecast of expenditure, whichI think would not be realised in practice and would therefore require ahigh rate of grant, or a higher expenditure figure with a lower rate of grant.    Tha more generous the rate of grant in relation to the forecast of expenditure the lower the rate burden but the bigger the risk we run of encouraging expenditure.6. I would recommend that we accept a realistic estimate ofexpenditure, but that we should aim for the lowest realistic estimatepossible.    On the evidence of the latest reports I doubt whether itwould be realistic to take a figure lower than the forecasts less 81 million.    And even the^e  81 million cuts involve jomeunpalatable decisions.7. I consider therefore that we should adopt the course set out inparagraphic, above.    I shall be consulting my colleagues againshortly when we have more precise details on the figures, which may need to be modified.    But I am sure we need to take a view now about our overall objectives here, and I invite my colleagues to agree with thegeneral line of action I have indicated above.G r department of the Environment23 October 19733
ANNEX ICOMPOSITION OP LOCAL AUTHORITY CURRENT EXPENDITURE 1974/75A. RELEVANT expenditure ,    Relevant expenditure is that part of local authority expenditure which istaken into account for the purposes of calculating rate support grant.   It is notthe same as total expenditure because it excludes, in 1973-74, certain items,(mainly contributions to Housing Revenue Account and to trading services).   A clear distinction must be drawn between relevant expenditure and the equivalentandpublic expenditure definition which excludes such factors as loan charges,/capitaldrawn from revenue. %B. NEW BASIS FOR RELEVANT EXPENDITURE2.    Ministers have already decided to bring the basis for rate support grantcalculations in 1974-75 more closely into line with actual expenditure financed from the rates.   This change to a new basis has to be borne in mind in making a comparison between estimated relevant expenditure in 1974/5 as compared to 1973/4.The principal changes in the definition are as follows;3.     Local authority contributions to Housing Revenue Account, Passenger transport authorities and other trading services will be considered relevant under the new basis.   Furthermore, certain expenditure of some estimated  96.6m on the police in 1974/5 will, on the new basis, also be considered as relevant expenditure forrate support grant purposes.   Details of the amounts accruing to relevant expenditure under each of these heads is given in the table below.   These amounts representexisting local authority expenditure, not additions to rate burdens.4,     On the other hand, local authority relevant and total expenditure will bereduced by the transfer of responsibility for the health and sewerage services to new authorities.   And expenditure on student awards now to be met as to 90$ byspecific grant will no longer be relevant for rate support grant.5.     The effect of these changes is summarised in the table below, which shows thatthe adoption of the new basis results in an apparent reduction in rate support grantas relevant expenditure is effectively reduced by  244m-. However this reductionresults in large part from the transfer of responsibility for sewerage from localauthorities to Regional Water Authorities who will be levying a charge for sewerageservices through the rating authorities.   The Government is committed to taking account of this burden on ratepayers in calculating the grant settlement.

CONFIDENTIALNOTES TO ANNEX II&quot;New basis&quot; means after taking account of the changes set out in Annex I.Non-relevant expenditure:    For 1974-75 this is the l.a. share of thecost of student awards, the remaining 90?Sof which are to he mot from specific grant.Sewerage and Water:   Although neither of these are now to falldirectly on rates , the Government has undertaken to take these into account for rsg purposes thisyear.   The forecast of  250nlllion representstotal sewerage expenditure plus an allowance forthe amount which the new RvVAs will he levyingto cover inherited deficits and the need to buildup v/orking balances.Police:   Certain police expenditure which v/as not previously takeninto account in arriving at the total of local authority expenditure is now to b;: included.    For purposes of comparingrates of growth the 1973-74 figure has to be added back in.
