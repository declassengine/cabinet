THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 110 COPY NO    gg23 October 1973CABINETA MID-TERM POPULATION CENSUS IN 1976Memorandum by the Secretary of State for jjthe Home department on 5 April the Cabinet decided (CM(73) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 11) to defer the decision on whether to hold a mid-term census, at an estimatedcost of  15 million, until the Chancellor of the Exchequer had completed his review of the public expenditure prospects.    they wished to be sure that existing census information was being fully usedbefore authorising expenditure on a new one; and they invited me toprovide further information about specific instances where central andlocal government decisions were based on census information and wherethe quality of decision-taking would be improved if this information wasmere up-to-date and accurate.    I attach a note on these matters preparedby the Central Statistical Office, the Office of Population Censuses and surveys and the General Register Office (Scotland) in consultation withother Departments concerned.R home Office23 October 1973
The Use of Census information.    General IThe results of a census are widely and intensively used &quot;by GovernmentDepartments, local authorities, industry and commerce and private &quot;bodies and individuals.   In particular, departmental programmes that are basedon national or regional projections of population rely heavily onthe statistics of fertility and migration that the census provides.   Butas time passes the information from a particular census grows progressively more out of date:   decisions about major investments of public capital haveto be made on the basis of unreliable projections or arbitrary assumptions.The following list gives examples of policies for whose applicationup-to-date census information is desirable, including a few instances of costly misallocations which might have been prevented by more up-to-date information.2.    Local Authority PlanningLocal authorities argue strongly that up-to-date information from the census on population, housing, employment and transport, etc is essential for making e.nd adapting their structure plans and for monitoringdevelopments.   In addition to the letter from the leader of the GLCto the Secretary of State for the Environment the following local governmentassociations have written in to support the need for a Census in 1976 -The Association of Municipal CorporationsThe County Councils association the Urban Districts Councils association the Rural Districts Councils association the London Boroughs AssociationLetters of support have also been received from several different TownClerks.Local populations change so fast that estimates of them not based ona recent census can be very misleading.   Thus the 1971 Census showed that the GLCs population projections published in 1971 over-estimated the number of children under 5 in all the inner London Boroughs by, on average, some 20 per cent.1
The Layfield Report on the G-greater London Development Plan firmly states the need to forecast the range of population in 1981 and 1991 as a &quot;basisof housing, employment, transport and other policies.   The Report says that the forecast number of households is crucial for the housebuildingprogramme and recommends a joint review of these forecasts between theDepartment of the Environment and the GLC in &quot;the light of the 1971 Census.(See also paragraph 5 below.)3.    New towns and overspill programmeDecisions about expanding existing towns and building new towns dependcrucially on the relationship between the size of the future population and the capacity of existing towns.   Total capital expenditure on new towns to date amounts to some  800 million and it is estimated that afurther  800 million (at 1972 prices) will be spent during the next fiveyears.   Up-to-date Census data on population and employment in the new towns is essential in guiding the way in which this money is spent,London provides an example of decisions taken wrongly because of lack of up-to-date Census data.   The London new towns programme was based on a study completed before the full results of the 1961 Census became available and was, indeed, based largely on the 1951 Census.   The studyover-estimated the growth of employment in London so that the new townsprogramme was pushed ahead faster than it would have been  with betterinformation.   The programme was eventually reduced by, for example, thedecision in 1969 not to go ahead with the Ipswich plan, a decision takenlargely on the evidence of the 1966 Sample Census.There was a similar experience in the North West.   Some  100 million hasalready been spent on Runcorn and Skelmersdale new towns on the basisof estimates (since proved false) of the future population and housingsituation in Liverpool and its surrounding region.   Earlier Censusfigures would have altered the plans and the^ expenditure.   (DOE)4.     Office development in LondonOffice building in London was severely restricted from 1964 onwards inthe mistaken belief that employment in Central London was growing by15,000 jobs a year and putting undue strain on transport and housing.2
In fact the I96I Census results (which were exceptionally late) subsequentlyshowed that it was growing at less than 6,000 jobs per year, one-third therate upon which previous policies had been based, and as a result therestrictions had to be eased.   (DOE)5.   HousingDespite the large expenditure on improvement grants over many years thereis increasing evidence - including Census evidence - that too little hasbeen done to improve the really black spots.   One of the main sources foridentifying housing stress areas is Census data for individual enumerationdistricts (eg on the proportion of households lacking amenities or living in overcrowded conditions).   The mid-term Census in 1976 would provideessential data for monitoring the progress of special assistance programmes in stress areas and for adjusting priorities.Information on ownership and projections of households and family structure -all based on the Census - are vital in planning future housing programmes.(DOE, SDD)6,   Roads and transport \\Information about journeys to work from a full Census is essential in estimating future road and transport needs within cities and in establishing the most economical distribution of resources&apos; lack of a 1976 Census would therefore reduce the effectiveness of public expenditure in this field.Planners in Merseyside say that the Merseyside Transportation Study basedon I966 data- is, after only 5 years, recognisably out of date.The allocation of grant under the new system now being developed will alsodepend on figures of population and travel to work derived largely fromthe CensusoThe effectiveness of the expenditure on Urban Transportation Studies(currently  1 million a year shared between DOE and local authorities)depends on the availability of up-to-date census data which are used toscale up the results of the sample studies that are made.   (DOE, SDD),3
7.   Urban Aid ProgrammesCensus data are used to show the incidence of factors which may contribute to deprivation and in particular to show the areas where multi-deprivationmay exists   The data are used to identify the most deprived areas under the continuing Urban Aid Programme, which has involved expenditure of  28 millionup to 1972.   (Home Office and other Departments).8,   Social and Physioa! Planning in GlasgowCensus data have helped to identify areas of special need in Glasgow andto detect undesirable trends in social structure.   The Government havealready provided an extra  5 million for the work in areas of special need,and sums possibly  80 million to  100 million in addition to existing programmes may be needed to improve the environment generally.   Up-to-date information will be needed to fix the necessary priorities and to monitorprogress.   (SDD).\&apos; fi&quot;&apos;9.   Immigrant CommunitiesThe Census provides the only comprehensive information on immigrants, theirmovements, their social oonditions and their economic activities.   Apartfrom the general question of race relations, specific information is needed in order to decide where to site services for immigrants and their children,and to decide how much should be done and where it should be done, to alleviate unemployment among them.   (Home Office, DHSS, DE),10, Services for the ElderlyInformation on the geographical distribution of the elderly is needed inorder to plan domiciliary care and the best location of residential homes and day oentres.   (DHSS, SED).11. Family PlanningInformation is needed about the social characteristics, age and familystructure of local populations in order to assess the need for family planning services and so to monitor the up-take; and in order to monitorthe effects on fertility patterns of the provision of those services.(DHSS).4
12.   Regional PolicyRegional economic growth can he fostered by investment incentives and other general measures? but only direct action can promote &quot;growth areas&quot; andcontrol decline elsewhere.   Planning for this and monitoring the resultsrequire social and economic analyses of the local population which onlythe Census provides.For the growth areas of Scotland for example - New Towns, Tweedbank in theCentral Borders, Port William, Moray Firth and the North East with north sea Oil - 1971 statistics will soon be out of date.   A 1976 Census would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of large programmes of public expenditure,The e.c. have not yet settled either the exact criteria for defining theareas to he assisted or the size of the Development Fund; but it willprobably be important for the Government to know the rates of migrationout of relatively depressed areas and also the local activity rates inemployment and self-employment.   Only a census can provide this informa-tion accurately.   It is worth noting that France and Germany will betaking censuses in the mid-1970s.    (DTI, DOE, CSO, Scottish Office).13*   Graduate EmploymentDecisions about the amount of higher education, whether made by government or by individuals deciding for themselves whether they will enter higher education, are influenced by the prospects of jobs for graduates.Estimates based on past censuses suggest that by I98I 5 to 10 per cent of male and 20 to 25 per cent of female graduates will be unable to find the traditional types of employment for graduates.   A Census in 1976 is theonly way to monitor trends of graduate employment properly, and its results would be important not only for higher education policy but also topotential entrants into higher education.   (DE).14.   Manpower Services commission the new Manpower Services Commission will want census information ontrends in occupations in order to plan the training and use of manpower.(DE).5
15*   Working PopulationThe CPRS point out that estimates of the working population are essential for economic management.   The Census is the main source of detailed dataon parts of the working population, viz the self-employed and those seeking work who are not registered as unemployed^   (DE).16.   Allocation of Central Government grants the allocation of Rate Support Grant between local authorities (about 2j900 million in England and Wales in 1973-74) relies heavily under boththe existing and the proposed formulae On accurate population estimates,but these can go badly awry between censuses.   Thus, by 1971 ^he estimates for some authorities were some 10 per cant adrift, and consequently grantspaid and expenditure were different from the Government&apos;s intention.Reorganisation of local government and of the methods of distributing thegrant will not ease the problem if population figures are not improved.Various methods of grant allocation are under discussion and all dependheavily on population estimates.   The errors in the population estimates which had built up by 1971 could, in the case of the new MetropolitanDistricts of Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, have led to under paymentof grants to each of these authorities of  3-1&quot; million to  4 million annuallyon the basis of formulae now under discussion.The distribution of central Government funds (currently about  1,700 millioneach year) to the regional health authorities for the administration of theNational Health Service is largely dependent on population data.
