DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS government cp(73) 118 COPY NO30 October 1973CABINETRATE SUPPORT GRANT DISTRIBUTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment, When we considered my proposals for the distribution of rate support grant last week (CM(73) 4^th Conclusions, Minute 3), concern was expressed at the impact which they might have on ratepayers in areastraditionally favourable to the Government,.2,        The problem arises mainly in the South East of England.    There isno doubt that local authority expenditure in that area tends to be higherthan in other parts of the country because costs are higher.    In theexisting (1966 Act) formula this v/as recognised by what we then called a&quot;metropolitan&quot; weighting;  a payment to some counties round London.Further studies show that if the formula in CP(73) 106 (which has beenput to local authorities for discussion) were applied, expenditure in the inner south eastern counties (i.e. Essex, Herts, Bucks, Berks, Surreyand Kent) would be some  6.45 per head more than the national average.Similarly in the outer south eastern counties (Oxfordshire, Bedfordshire,Hampshire, West and East Sussex and the Isle of Wight) there would beextra expenditure per head of about  1. 72.    These excesses have been takeninto account in a recalculated version of this formula, the results of whichare set out in Appendix I side by side with those of my earlier proposal,,But the recalculated formula also includes the reinstatement of the former(1966 Act) 5 per cent weighting for London, since we could not recognisehigher costs in the South East without doing likewise for London.    The newformula is at Appendix II.3. The effect is to alter the distribution of grant as compared with my previous proposals so that rather more goes to the South East counties, andto London, while rather less goes into most of the metropolitan counties.An incidental effect is that sparse areas such as Powys in Wales also get more grant whereas Glamorgan gets slightly less.    On this basis I would recommend that the level of resources grant be fixed at 27j per cent since25 per cent, which was my recommendation on the earlier formula, would both give too much to London and not enough to other metropolitan counties.
4.        I invite my colleagues to agree that the needs element of rate support grant should be distributed in accordance with the new formulaset out in Appendix II with the resources element at about 27-1 per cent ofthe total of needs plus resources,G R.Department of the Environment29 October 19732
The following table compares the share of grant (needs and resourceselements) received under two variants of the proposed new system withthe share of grant receivable if the existing 1966 Act system were applied to the new authorities.(The figures show the fo gain or loss in the proportion of thenational, fcrant total payable to each county - whatever that totalmay be.   The actual amount...payable to each authority in 1974-75will depend on what national total is fixed for the year.   Butthe 1974-75 total will certainly be higher than the 1973-74 total,and there should be few if any counties to whom less grant willbe paid in 1974-75 than 1973-74.)Change in share of grant with resources element at followingproportions of total	25!&amp; resources			21^ffo resources	COUNTY	Pirst&apos;Scheme	Second Scheme		First Scheme	Second Scheme	(as in	(as in		(as&apos; in	(as in	CP(73)106)	this paper)		CP(73)106)	this paper)Avon*	5.2	6.4		5.6	6.8Bedfordshire	-   7.0	-   9.0		-   6.7	-   8.5Berkshire	- 10.7	-   2.5		- 11.0	-   3.1Buckinghamshire	- 14.3	- 12.0		- 14.1	- 11.8Cambridgeshire	3.2	2.3		3.0	2.2Cheshire *	-   2.2	-   6.2		-   2.0	-   6.0Cleveland *	-   1.7	-   2.8		-   1,5	-   2.5Cornwall	-   5.1	-   5.7		-   5.0	-   5.6Cumbria*	-   0.9	-   1.7		-   0.8	-   1.5Derbyshire	-   1.6	-   5.2		-   1.4	-   5.0Devon	-   0.8	-   0.8		-   0.7	-   0.6Dorset	-   0.5	-   3.3		-   0.2	-   2.9Durham*	&quot;*    2 o 2	- ,8.3 .		-    2.0	-   8.1East Sussex*	12.9	18.7		13.7	19.4Essex	-   7.1	-   1 .9		-   7.2	-   2.0Gloucestershire^	-   6.9	- 11.8		-   6.6	- 11.4Hampshire	0.2	0.8		0.5	1.1Hereford and					Worcester^	-    3.5	-   6.2		-   3.3	-   5.9Hertfordshire	- 16.0	- 12.2		- 15.7	- 12.0Huinberside&apos;5&apos;&apos;&quot;	-   2.3	-   3.9 -		-   2.2	-. 3.7Isle of Wight	-1 .0	-   0.1		i     1;. 4	0.4Lent	0.6	5.2		1.0	5.5Lancashire^	-   0.4	-   1.7		-   0.3&apos;	-   1.5Leicestershire	-   2.6	-   4.7 h		-   2.4	-   4.5Lincolnshire^	-   2.7	-   3.9		-   2.6	-   3.8
