DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) X20 COPY NO     gg30 October 1973CABINETRATE SUPPORT GRANT - VARIABLE DOMESTIC RELIEFMemorandum by the Minister for Local Governmentand development . The Secretary of State for the Environment is abroad at present;and he has asked me, in his absence, to circulate this memorandum.When Cabinet considered our proposals for the distribution of rate support grant last week (CM(73) 49th Conclusions, Item 3), theSecretary of State was invited, in consultation with the Chief Secretary,Treasury, to review the proposed transitional arrangements.    these were the proposals for giving additional domestic relief to areas whererate burdens would rise because of loss of grant.If&quot;&quot; II &apos; : v , i ! &quot;2.        I have now considered an extension of the previous proposals.If we are to have a new variable domestic element it could take intoaccount either the loss or the gain of gtf&amp;at vustdsr ftfae sow grantarrangements ac well as any increased charges for water and seweragearising from reorganisation.    Authorities losing grant would receive more than the present 6p domestic element whereas those gaining fromgrant would receive less.    There would be a cut-off so that in no area would the domestic poundage be higher than the non-domestic (that is wewould not go below Op to a minus domestic element).    The appendix(version 1) shows the effect of the revised proposals on five new districts.3. This proposal would have the advantage (as compared with theprevious proposal) that the relief to grant losers would be largely paid for by grant gainers.    As such it would satisfy the criteria referredto in the minutes of the Cabinet discussion on 23 October of reducingany encouragement to extra expenditure by the gaining authorities fromtheir increased grant.    It would also, in requiring a smaller allocation to the domestic element, leave more for keeping the gross poundagedown.1
4.        On the other hand the proposal would reduce the gains bydomestic ratepayers in the big cities, since (except in so far as the cuttoff applied) what the domestic ratepayer gained in grant hs would lose inreduced domestic relief.    This would leave bigger net benefits from thenew giant system in the big cities with commercial and industrial rate-payers than with domestic ratepayers.    It would be directly contrary tothe idea of shifting more of the rate burden from the domestic ratepayeron to industry and commerce,5. There is no apparent way of making this variable domestic reliefscheme still more flexible.    But it should be remembered that theproposed new rate rebate scheme, which I estimate will cost about 100 million a year, will provide a lot more flexibility in responding to the needs of individuals.6.        I conclude that while it would be possible to operate a variabledomestic element on the lines set out above its effect of making the newgrant system chiefly benefit industry and commerce in the big citieswhile taking some of the gains away from the domestic ratepayer therewould make it politically unacceptable and I cannot advise my colleagues to adopt it.INCREASED DOMESTIC DE-RATING7.        I have therefore considered a different approach which would achieve our objectives of limiting the increase in domestic rate burdenswithout increasing the total cost on the Exchequer.    This we cuuld doby using the domes tic element of grant which is equivalent to a domesticde-rating.    If we de-rated houses withoxit increasing the Exchequer grantan extra burden would fall on commerce and industry.    In very roundterms, for each 5 per cent domestic de-rating  30 million extra goes on the rate burdens of commerce and industry.    So to go from our present6p domestic element which is equivalent to about a 15 per cent domesticde-rating to a lOp domestic element equivalent to about a 25 per centdomestic de-rating might increase the burden on industry and commerceby about  60 million.8.        We could combine this with the variable domestic elementsuggested in the Secretary of State&apos;s earlier paper (CP(73) 106).    Thusall domestic ratepayers would get increased relief of a minimum of 4p(partially offset by increased total poundage because of the lower needs and resources grant total).    The variable element would deal with areas where rates would other/ise go up because of loss of grant or the effects of reorganisation of water and sewerage.    In these areas the increase inrate burden over 4p would be fully offset by an increased domesticelement which we would calculate separately for each district.    Such ascheme gives us maximum flexibility according to the circumstances ofeach district.2
9. The annex shows the two new versions for five districts.Version 1 is the approach set out in paragraphs 2 to 4 above which i recommend we reject.    Version 2 shows the effects of the scheme Ioutline in paragraphs 7 and 8 above.    It has attractions but itcarries the risk demonstrated by the reductions in poundage shown inthe table for Eastbourne and Liverpool, that it would encourageexpenditure.R G P-Department of the Environment30 October 1973
