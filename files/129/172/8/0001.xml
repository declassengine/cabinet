THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 10822 October 1973CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1977-78Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer.        When we discussed our public expenditure plans in July(CM(73) 38th and 39th Conclusions) the Chief Secretary and I were invited to pursue bilateral discussions with our colleagues with theobject of ensuring that the totals in this year&apos;s White Paper should notexceed those we published last December.    We have now completedthose discussions.2.        If we are to leave ourselves with reasonable room for manoeuvreover the coming year, we should now be taking decisions to cut back onthe totals in last December&apos;s White Paper.    This is a view which is now very widely held, and I agree with it.    It is reinforced by the inevitableconsequences of last week&apos;s changes in the price of oil for, however that situation now develops, what has already taken place must imply aserious loss of real income for this country, and a reduced capacity tomeet all demands.    In resource terms the imperative need is to ensurethat we maintain sufficient capacity to increase exports to deal with thebalance of payments and to increase productive investment to providefor future growth; and the successful handling of our prices and incomes policy requires a reasonable minimum increase in privately-financedconsumption.    At least in the short term there is the question of externalconfidence in sterling (and the exchange rate) so long as we are runninga substantial current deficit.    Our policies are therefore bound to be closely watched.    We cannot by Governmental action alone halt inflationor achieve satisfactory growth.    But we can and must control public sector spending.3.        Despite my view that we should now be taking decisions to cutback on the totals in last December&apos;s White Paper, I recognise the verygj?63t difficulties involved in such a course, and for that reason I do not propose it.   What does concern me is the approach that was expressed in cabinet, during our consideration of the Stage 3 package, that it mightnot even be necessary to ensure that the yearly totals in this year&apos;white Paper do not exceed those we published last year.copy NO
4.        Such an approach in my view ignores the realities of our economic position and of external confidence, and I am afraid that I could not accept it.    Because it may take some time to settle the detailed savingsinvolved, I must ask my colleagues for a decision, which can if necessary be reflected in public statements about the economy during this verycritical phase, that the yearly totals in this Decembers White paper will not exceed, in real terms, those we published last year,5.        This years Public Expenditure Survey report, together with majorsubsequent changes, shows levels of expenditure considerably higher thanthose published for the same years in last December^ White Paper,To do no more than get back to the levels shown in that White paper will require savings of about  570 million for 1975-76, and about 700 million for 1976-77 (there is an excess of about  320 million for1974-75 also, but this would be removed by allowing two sets of policies to take effect in that year without offsets: first, those by whichwe have relieved the building industry overload in 1973-74; and secondlycertain of those by which my proposals would moderate expenditure inthe later years).    This, with a reasonable progression to 1977-78, hasbeen the objective which the Chief Secretary and I have pursued in ourbilateral discussions.    They do not allow for the outstanding additionalbids which some Ministers have made.    To the extent that any of thosebids sre agreed, further offsetting savings would be necessary.    Severalmajor items where policy is not yet finally decided are fo.ound tomaterialise in any case as charges on the Contingency R^reserve; butdespite this I propose to reduce the reserve below the level provided in the PESC Report.6. My proposals in the light of these discussions are shown in the tables at Annex 1.    These tables also ahow how the totals for the programmes in last year&apos;s White Paper, as recosted for price changesnow compare both with the latest agreed PESC costings and with the totals as they would be after taking account of my proposals.    The broadeffect of the changes I propose are briefly indicated in the notes to the table.    In some cases I understand from the bilateral talks that theMinisters concerned would be prepared to endorse the savings proposed.I recognise that most proposals have their difficulties, but I believe thatthis pattern, subject if necessary to minor offsetting adjustments, would both achieve our main objective and would be defensible.7. The table at Annex 2 brings together the figures for the programmes for the period up to 1977-78, showing how they would increase if my proposals are adopted.    I should stress that I have excluded from the programmes themselves all items which can legitimately be considered,at this stage, as claims on the reserve, even where it is evident thatthose claims will shortly materialise.2
8.        As regards defence, my proposals are that the Secs-etery of Statefor Defence should forego his claims for additions to the Survey figures(which are provisional for the last two years) and come down below the survey level by  50 million in 1975-76,  75 million in 1976-77 and 100 million in 1977-78.    He has offered to effect a reduction of 30 million below the Survey level in 1975-76, and to make savings onhis planned defence expenditure sufficient to eliminate his additionalbids and come down to the Survey level for the following two years,subject to a reservation on one item which could involve a substantial amount.    The figure for 1977-78 would be provisional pendingcompletion and consideration of joint studies now in hand on defence expenditure in the longer term.    The details are shown in Annex 3,including, on various bases, the proportion of GNP going to defence.9. A satisfactory outcome is also conditional on our resolving a problem concerning those programmes which involve current expenditureof local authorities in England and Wales.    The measures which weannounced in May required reductions of about  81 million (at 1973prices) in these programmes in 1974-75, and we announced that the rate support grant negotiations this autumn would proceed on the basis thatthese economies are being made.    These reductions, along with otheraccepted changes, are taken into account in the Survey Report and running Tally figures.    But it appears from the forecasts now putforward in connection with the rate support grant negotiations that, sofar from ta?jung steps to implement our May decisions, local authoritiesare planning to increase their 1974-75 expenditure on the programmes inquestion.    The excess ever the Survey Report and Running Tally figuresis about  140 million (or about  66 million over the Cmnd. 5178 level)mainly accounted for by education ( 63 million), personal social services ( 41 million), roads ( 20 million) and misceUaneous local services ( 14 million).10.       Some limited part of this may be inevitable; there is, for instance,a special problem over higher subventions for concessionary fares(about  17 million).    But we cannot accept the remainder of the excessfor rate support grant unless we are to go back completely on what wesaid in May.    Moreover, unless the excess for 1974-75 is eliminated,it will entail consequential increases in the estimates for all the later years, thus requiring new offsetting savings.    I must ask therefore that the Ministers concerned should join now in taking all necessary stepsto see that the spending plans of the local authorities on the variousprogrammes are brought into line with the proposals which I have set out.11.       I also attach further tables as follows:-Annex 4: Main increases and decreases in programmes since cmnd. 5178 was published showing that the  500 millionsavings which I announced Oxx 21 May have been more than offset.- 3       P - ----&apos;     -
Annex 5:  The proposed division, for those programmeswhere it is relevant, of the savings in Annex 1 between england, Scotland and Wales.    To avoid delay in getting the White Paper published it will be important that we shouldsettle the geographical division of the savings on which we decide in these areas.Conclusions12.       I ask my colleagues to agree:-a. that the yearly totals in this December&apos;s &quot;white paper should not exceed, in real terms, the correspondingtotals in last year&apos;s White Paper, and that this decision can, if necessary, be reflected in public statements aboutthe economy;b. to modify the provision for their services up to1917-78 as in the tables attached;c. that, so far as local authority current expenditure is concerned, they will proceed on the basis outlined inparagraph 10 above.A BTreasury22 October 19734
