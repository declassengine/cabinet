PREFACE1. In 1969 the Minister of Overseas Development published for the first time the United Kingdom memorandum to the Development assistance committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment to provide additional information about British developmentactivities. The 1971 and 1972 memoranda were also published, and thisyear&apos;s memorandum, which was presented to the DAC in May 1973, is published with the same object. Unlike previous years however, this year&apos;smemorandum is being published for the first time as a White Paper. Thememorandum covers United Kingdom development activities in the calendar year 1972 with special reference to aspects which the DAC regard asimmediately relevant to their purposes. Because the memorandum hasprimarily been drafted for purposes of international discussion, figures are expressed in dollars as well as sterling.2. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,established by a Convention in Paris in December 1960, is the principal forum for consultations at both Ministerial and official levels on economic issues of common interest to members, who comprise most of the european and other developed countries. Its work embraces broad aspects of theworld economy and its aims include the promotion of policies contributing to sound economic expansion in non-member countries in the process ofeconomic development.3. The Development Assistance Committee is one of the specialistcommittees set up by OECD to achieve its aims. It is concerned with thevolume and effectiveness of resources made available to less developed countries. Members periodically review together the amount and the natureof their contributions to aid programmes, bilateral and multilateral, and consult on other relevant aspects of their development assistance policies.The memorandum now published is the current contribution by the UnitedKingdom to this process of review.4.  Participating in the work of the DAC are:Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany,Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland,the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Commission of theEuropean Economic Communities.5. Over 90 per cent of the net public and private sector flows to the developing countries in 1971 came from members of the DAC. Most ofthe remainder came from the multilateral agencies, which are largely financed by DAC member countries.6. A detailed statistical account of United Kingdom aid is provided in&quot; British Aid Statistics &quot;. The next edition of this is expected to be publishedlater this year.143448
introduction. Preliminary United Kingdom economic aid figures for 1972 show netofficial disbursements as $625m. ( 250m.) and gross disbursements as $791m.( 316m.) The 1971 figures were $574m. ( 236m.) and $676m. ( 278m.)respectively.2. There were no major new developments in the United Kingdomaid programme in 1972. Her Majesty&apos;s Government was able to confirm that in 1971, as in 1969 and 1970, the United Kingdom&apos;s net flows offinancial resources to developing countries reached 1 per cent of GNP. Inthe Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd. 5178) the plannedaid programme for the period up to 1976-77 was announced. The changesfrom the previous year in the programme figures planned, which have resultedin higher allocations at the beginning of the period and lower ones towardsthe end, were brought about by the provision of additional money for relief and reconstruction in Bangladesh and by the switching of sums from later toearlier years in anticipation of special demands on the aid programmeup to 1974-75.3. In December 1972 it was announced that a House of CommonsSelect Committee on Overseas Development was to be set up. The termsof reference of the Committee are &quot; to consider United Kingdom assistance for overseas development, and to report thereon&quot;, and the Committee,which was established in February 1973, is expected to continue its workfor a period of about 18 months.4. The United Kingdom&apos;s entry into the European Community will affect, in a number of ways, the United Kingdom&apos;s trade and aid relationships with developing countries. It is not possible at this stage to detail the likelychanges in the aid programme, but in 1975 the United Kingdom will begin to contribute to the European Development Fund and consequently the share of the aid programme devoted to multilateral aid will increase.5. The United Kingdom will be participating with its Communitypartners in the negotiations with developing countries envisaged in theTreaty of Accession. All members of the Community will also participate in the multilateral trade negotiations in the GATT later this year. In1972 the United Kingdom played a prominent part in the negotiations which led to the conclusion of the International Cocoa Agreement.

II.  VOLUME OF AIDDisbursements6. In 1972 gross disbursements of official development assistance andother official flows (comprising a number of miscellaneous grants classifiedfor balance of payments purposes as economic transactions but not includedin the aid programme) totalled $791-4m. ( 316-3m.) compared with$676-lm. ( 277-9m.) in 1971.*7. Net disbursements, i.e. gross disbursements less amortisation repay-ments on past aid loans to developing countries, totalled $624-9m.( 249-8m.) in 1972 compared with $573-8m. ( 235 -8m.) in 1971.8.  The table below shows the breakdown of disbursements by type:	1971		1972		Sm.	( m.)	$m.

Gross aid programme disbursements in 1971-72 totalled $699-lm.( 287 -3m.); disbursements against the net aid programme were $556-8m.( 228 -9m.) An additional $25m. ( 10m.) was provided towards relief inBangladesh but expenditure exceeded the net aid programme target sosupplemented by $8 -8m. ( 3-6m.) Arrangements exist within which up to$12-5m. ( 5m.) over-expenditure may be carried forward for adjustment in later years (see paragraph 12 below).10. Gross aid programme disbursements for 1972-73 are estimated at$707-6m. ( 282-8m.) including up to a further $25m. ( 10m.) for relief in Bangladesh. The estimated net figure is $626-2m. ( 250-3m.) Becauseof expected pressures on the programme it had been agreed that anadditional $38m. ( 15m.) could be brought forward from future years if required. In the event this has not been necessary. The excess expenditure incurred in 1971-72 should be cleared in 1972-73.* Included in these figures were $69-48m. ( 27-77m.) in 1972 and S10-41m. ( 4-28m.) in1971 which represented forgiveness of outstanding obligations of principal and interest dueunder a number of loans for compensation and commutation of pensions of overseas officers.This forgiveness arises from arrangements announced in 1970 that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere willing to assume responsibility from 1 April 1971 for the current costs of pensions and compensation payable by overseas governments to British expatriate officers in respect of pre-independence service overseas.
Commitments11. The United Kingdom Aid Programme is controlled on a disburse-ment basis. Commitments are entered into and discharged at a rateintended to give rise to the approved level of disbursements. The level of bilateral commitments at the end of 1971 was $703m. ( 289m.); at the endof 1972 it was $836m. ( 335m.). Total new bilateral commitments enteredinto during 1972 were $750m. ( 300m.) (Total bilateral expenditure of aidagainst commitments during 1972 was $636m. ( 254m.).)12. Disbursement forecasts are reviewed during the course of eachfinancial year. Steps are taken to control commitments and their dischargeaccording to whether the forecasts are high or low. Methods of improvingforecasting are continually being sought in order to achieve the fullestdisbursement of the approved programme. During the year, on an experi-mental basis, monthly checks of disbursements and degrees of commitmenthave been instituted. The arrangements for the carrying over of up to$12-5m. ( 5m.) over-expenditure from one year to the next have proveduseful in avoiding end-of-year difficulties with the programme. Furtherarrangements for flexibility over the five-year public expenditure programmeperiod were made in 1972.Source of Funds for the Aid Programme13. The size of the aid programme is determined by the government during the course of its annual review of Public Expenditure which sets outthe proposed levels of expenditure for the following four financial years.This review is presented to Parliament as a White Paper, the most recentbeing Cmnd. 5178 which was published in December 1972. In this thefigures for the aid programme are given net of amortisation receipts and inconstant prices. For planning purposes they are grossed up (see paragraph 18).Detailed proposals to implement the aid programme thus determined arethen prepared and funds are provided annually by Parliament on the basisof detailed estimates of expenditure presented to it. Payments to honourthe remaining promissory notes to be issued to the IDA under the FirstReplenishment are however paid direct from the Consolidated Fund underthe IDA Act of 1964; these payments are now expected to be substantiallycompleted in 1973-74. Amortisation and interest receipts in respect of past loans are not deducted when Parliamentary authority for new expenditure is sought.Aid as a proportion of Central Government Expenditure14. Total Central Government expenditure on aid compared with CentralGovernment expenditure for all programmes in 1971 and 1972 is shownin the following tables: -Total current and capital expenditure* by theCentral Government (at current prices)    ...      19,798       22,457       +13Development assistance  m.19711972PercentagechangeGross        ...     ...Net of amortisation* Source: Financial Statistics.269231305243+134-5
Prospects for 1973 onwards15. The gross aid programme for 1973-74 at current prices is $773m.( 309m.). This could be expected to produce calendar year gross disburse-ments in 1973 of about $726m. ( 290m.). Estimated capital repaymentsin 1973 are $86m. ( 34m.) producing a likely net official disbursement figureof about $641m. ( 256m.). Estimated receipts of interest in 1973 are$70m. ( 28m.).16. New commitments of all categories of official flows were $912m.( 365m.) in 1972 compared with $720m. ( 296m.) in 1971.17. The planned programme announced in the White Paper (Cmnd. 5178)for the period up to 1976-77 is shown in the following table: m. at 1972 survey prices1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77Aid Programme        ...    242-2 270-2 266-9 277-6 291-0 322-other net investment bythe CommonwealthDevelopmentCorporation (CDC)      2-3 4-4 3-2 3-3 3-0 2-0Total Public Expenditureon Overseas Aid      ...    244-5      274-6      270-1       280-9      294-0      324-0The corresponding figures in the previous year&apos;s White Paper up to 1975-76(on the same price basis) from 1971-72 to 1975-76 were  228-lm.,  247-9m., 259-3m.,  281-lm. and  307m. The changes from the previous year inthe programme figures planned, which have resulted in higher allocationsat the beginning of the period and lower ones towards the end, have beenbrought about by two factors. Firstly, in 1971-72 additional money wasmade available for Bangladesh relief, and some excess expenditure was alsoincurred. Further additional money was also provided for relief and reconstruction in Bangladesh during 1972-73. Secondly, as it was anticipatedthat there would be special additional demands on the aid programme up to1974-75 provision was made for the borrowing of sums from later (notional)years of the programme to increase the amount available in the earlier years.This arrangement provided welcome flexibility in the administration of the aid programme, but it is no longer expected that this switching will be needed. If, therefore, those adjustments are eliminated, the true level of programme for the future years is shown in the White Paper as follows: m. at 1972 survey prices1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77257-0 280-1 305-9 333-318. For planning purposes and for securing Parliamentary authority forthe actual expenditure, the previous year&apos;s Survey prices for the coming year are revised to current prices and the expected amortisation receipts addedto secure a gross total. These figures are reviewed by Ministers in their determination of public expenditure as a whole. The same grossing upprocess is then followed to prepare planning totals for the next year. for later years broad assumptions about price changes are made in order tosecure forward planning figures.
III.   FINANCIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONSTerms of Aid Disbursed in 197219. Of the total of gross official development assistance and other officialdisbursements amounting to $791m. ( 316m.) in 1972, $465m. ( 186m.) or59 per cent was in grant or grant-like form (including technical assistance and contributions to multilateral agencies); $225m. ( 90m.) or 28 per cent was asloans on interest-free terms; $45m. ( 18m.) or 6 per cent was disbursementson loans provided at fixed concessionary rates of interest; $6m. ( 2m.) or1 per cent was disbursements from earlier loans at market rates of interest(including loans with interest waivers) $50m. ( 20m.) or 6 per cent was inthe form of overseas investment by the CDC. Overall the terms ofgovernment-to-government loans disbursed in 1972 (omitting flows throughthe CDC) provided a weighted average grant element of 71 per cent.Terms of Aid Committed in 197220. The total value of new commitments of official developmentassistance in 1972 was $900m. ( 360m.) of which $540m. ( 216m.) or 60 percent was in grant form (including technical assistance taken to be the sameas disbursements and contributions to multilateral agencies) and $360m.( 144m.) was as loans. Of the total value of new government-to-governmentloan commitments entered into during the year 86 per cent was interest-free and 99 : 6 per cent carried a grace period for capital repayments. Taking the combined value of government-to-government development assistance loans90 per cent had a grant element of 61 per cent or more. The combinedweighted grant element of government-to-government loans was 74 per cent.When taken together with grant commitments, the grant element of the total was $612m. ( 245m.) or 89 per cent of the commitments.21. The bulk of loans continue to be interest-free. Where loans bearinterest it is at fixed concessionary rates ranging from 1 per cent to 6 per cent.This pattern of loans provides flexibility in the terms of United Kingdomlending to those recipient countries for which interest-bearing loans are considered appropriate and allows the United Kingdom to harmonise withthe terms provided by other DAC members. Most of the interest-bearingloans committed in 1972 bore interest of 2 per cent or less.The DAC Recommendations on Financial Terms and Conditions22. The United Kingdom complied fully in 1972 with both the alternativetargets set by the 1969 Supplement to the Terms Recommendation:(a) By providing 90 per cent (against the target of at least 85 per cent)of official development assistance commitments with a grant elementfor each transaction of at least 61 per cent;(6) By attaining an overall average grant element of 93 per cent (againstthe target of at least 85 per cent) in 85 per cent of its officialdevelopment assistance commitments.23. The United Kingdom endorsed the revised Terms Recommendationwhich came into force on 1 January, 1973, and will make every effort in1973 to attain both the overall objective of an average grant element of at
least 84 per cent in total official development assistance commitments andthe special target in respect of the least developed countries. This providesthat the average grant element of all official development assistancecommitments from a donor should either be at least 86 per cent to eachleast developed country averaged over a period of three years, or at least90 per cent annually for the least developed countries as a group. To meet this special target aid to the group of least developed countries will beprovided as a mixture of interest-free loans and grants determined accordingto the circumstances of each case.Criteria for Appropriate Terms and Conditions24. United Kingdom policy towards the terms of government-to-govern-ment aid loans continues to be one of adapting these terms to meet theeconomic circumstances of the recipient country, taking especially intoaccount income per head and the prospects for its balance of paymentsbearing in mind debt service liabilities arising from debts already contracted.The terms of aid extended to the recipient country by other donor countries are also taken into account. This policy conforms to the DAC Recommenda-tions on Financial Terms and Conditions by relating the terms of aid on acase-by-case basis to the circumstances of each less-developed country or group of countries. It also conforms with current DAC thinking on theproblems of the indebtedness of developing countries. The policy has been followed regularly by the United Kingdom in consortia and consultativegroup discussions of assistance to be given to individual countries.Analysis of Re-financing and Consolidation Operations25. The major &quot; re-financing &quot; operation in the aid programme in 1972,as in the previous year, was a further interest-free loan to India amountingto $20m. ( 8m.) to reimburse the Government of India for certain repay-ments of capital and interest made on a number of aid agreementsconcluded between 1958 and 1965. This re-financing was made available,in 1972-73 to the Government of India as the United Kingdom&apos;s contribu-tion towards a multilateral scheme sponsored by the Aid India Consortiumfor debt relief amounting to approximately $180m. in each of the years1972-73 and 1973-74 designed to alleviate the burden of debt servicingon the Indian balance of payments arising from the terms on which pastaid loans were given. The effect of the scheme is to release the equivalentamount of free foreign exchange which can then be applied to the purchaseof essential imports. The terms for the re-financing loan were those whichthe United Kingdom applies to all other official development financing inIndia, i.e. interest-free with a maturity of 25 years and a seven years&apos; graceperiod, giving a grant element of 77 per cent.26. Under an interim debt relief scheme sponsored by the Aid PakistanConsortium, relief of $233 -5m. on debt service payments falling due between1 May, 1971, and 30 June, 1973, was made available to the Governmentof Pakistan by the Western creditor countries. The United kingdom share of this total sum was $32-45m. ( 12 -46m.). Four-fifths of the UnitedKingdom share was provided by re-scheduling payments due under pastaid loans and the residual one-fifth is being offered by commercial creditors.A nominal moratorium interest rate of 1 per cent was charged on the.: H       9 if ...     : [&quot;143448
re-scheduled aid loan repayments. The scheme was a short-term reliefoperation designed to alleviate Pakistani current balance of payments difficulties. Repayments are due to start on 1 July, 1974, and will bespread over three years.Financial Terms Granted to Development Banks27. Where financial assistance is channelled through local developmentinstitutions there are usually three stages in the lending process; from theUnited Kingdom to the recipient Government, from the recipient Govern-ment to the local development institution, and from the local developmentinstitution to its clients, who are frequently private sector firms. In thisthird stage, the United Kingdom regards it as important that the loans madeby the local development institution to its clients should bear a reasonablerelation to the terms on which the money could be borrowed in the domestic market. The original government-to-government loan is on the termsconsidered appropriate to the economic circumstances of the recipientcountry. The United Kingdom would normally prefer that the original aidloan should be on-lent to the local development institution by the recipientGovernment on the concessionary terms on which it is made available bythe United Kingdom thus enabling the local development institution tostrengthen its local currency resources for subsequent investment in otherdevelopment projects. However, there is no objection if the recipientGovernment wishes to on-lend the aid loan at an intermediate, but stillconcessionary, rate.Procurement Policy28. Whilst the extent of procurement in a donor country which may result from the tying practices of that country is not fully revealed bystatistics of contractually tied aid, the proportion of United Kingdombilateral aid so tied to United Kingdom goods and services in 1972 (leavingt out of account the cost of technical assistance, aid for compensation and pensions, re-financing and other compensatory payments) was 44 per cent.In addition, further procurement in the United Kingdom arises from the considerable amount of bilateral financial aid tied to United Kingdom or local goods and services, the proportions of which are not always specifiedin advance. The estimated percentage of further procurement in the UnitedKingdom which results from such aid was 24 per cent, making an estimated total of effective tying and procurement of 67 per cent, without regard toany further procurement which may result from untied aid.29. Although United Kingdom bilateral aid is normally tied to thepurchase of British goods and services, the United Kingdom is ready in thecase of independent countries to consider in exceptional cases untying alimited part of its financial aid for the purpose of meeting local costs of projects where this is judged appropriate; for the British dependencies thecircumstances may require a greater proportion of the aid to be devotedto local costs or local procurement. In deciding whether there are excep-tional circumstances justifying some local cost aid, account is taken of anumber of factors including the policy of other donors, the relative positionand objectives of the United Kingdom as a donor in relation to the recipient country concerned and the developmental case for such aid.  The
latter will depend upon such factors as the potential availability of domesticresources and savings in the recipient country, the efforts made by the recipient country to improve the mobilisation of its resources, and whetherit is desired to use United Kingdom aid for projects of high developmentalpriority in fields such as agriculture and rural development which inevitablyhave a high local cost content. The case for providing some local cost aid to the least developed countries is judged as in the case of all independent countries against these criteria.30. The United Kingdom provides a considerable amount of programme aid which generates local currency resources (counterpart funds)which may be used, if the recipient Government so desires, to finance thelocal costs of development projects. This can be helpful in the circumstancesof a country like India. Additional budgetary resources are also generatedwhen a recipient Government on-lends at market rates to a local revenue-earning enterprise funds which had been provided by the United KingdomGovernment on concessionary terms. It is United Kingdom policy toencourage such on-lending since the additional budgetary resources generatedcan be used to finance local costs; but, as in the case of counterpart funds,the United Kingdom does not normally specify that they must be so used.Budgetary aid, of which the United Kingdom provided $15m. ( 6m.) in 1972,by its nature cannot be tied formally to overseas procurement, but thearrangements with the recipient countries are that offshore procurementsupported by this budgetary aid will be from the United Kingdom except where this would clearly be uneconomic. Overall, therefore, the UnitedKingdom aid programme continues to provide a substantial amount of flexibility in the treatment of local costs.31. For a number of countries, particularly the dependencies, AssociatedStates and independent countries in Southern Africa, waivers of procurementrestrictions were granted to allow procurement of specified categories ofgoods from third countries when the price was favourable in comparison withthat quoted in the United Kingdom. For all countries, the concessionaryforeign content limit in goods financed from tied aid is 20 per cent, sofacilitating the administration and use of tied aid.32. The United Kingdom provides contributions to multilateral financinginstitutions on a reciprocally untied basis so that procurement is open to members, associates and other significant contributors who also untie theiraid.IV.  AID ADMINISTRATION AND PROGRAMMINGAid Administration33. The Overseas Development Administration of the Foreign and commonwealth Office continued to be responsible for the United Kingdomaid programme.34. The three new Development Divisions covering Southern Africa,East Africa and South-East Asia, referred to in paragraph 63 of last year&apos;smemorandum, were established in September/October 1972 but will not11143448 b* 2
become fully operational until all the professional advisory staff of the divisions are in post. This is expected to be by the second quarter of 1973.In order to facilitate the application and more effective administration of aidin areas covered by the ODA&apos;s Development Divisions it has been decidedto delegate certain authority to Heads of British Diplomatic Missions advised by the Heads of the Development Divisions in the areas concerned to approve capital aid projects for the independent developing countries towhich they are accredited, and in which programmes of capital projectaid operate.   The delegation is expected to operate from 1 April, 1973.35. The administrative costs of the ODA (salaries, accommodation, etc.)in 1972 represented about 2 per cent of the gross expenditure on the aid programme. This includes the cost of certain common services ; notaccounted for in the 1971 calculation (1  per cent).Assistance Programming36. The United Kingdom&apos;s responsibilities to its remaining dependenciescontinue to be given special weight in allocations. Emphasis is also givento multilateral aid and technical assistance. Much of the multilateral sectorflows result from international agreements in respect of the IDA and the regional Development Banks. The United Kingdom continues to supportthe reform of the United Nations Development System and as a measureof its satisfaction with progress in this direction has increased its sterlingcontribution to UNDP for 1972 by one-third over that made in 1971. it also announced a further sterling increase for 1973. Looking to the future,Britain&apos;s entry into the European Community will affect the pattern of aidallocations. Contributions to the European Development Fund will startin 1975 and will, in due course, further increase the share of the risingprogramme devoted to multilateral aid. Disbursements on account of IDAare also likely to increase the share of the programme absorbed by multi-lateral aid. Allocations of bilateral aid, both capital and technical assistance, are made after consideration of country circumstances.37. Individual projects are examined in relation to their economic and social benefit to the recipient country and to its plan or general developmentstrategy. A cost-benefit analysis of projects is carried out in accordancewith the principles of the ODA Manual of Project Appraisal; this manualhas been published and circulated in the DAC. All projects over $lm.( 400,000) in value are subject to approval by the Minister on therecommendation of a Projects Committee of senior officials. For smallprojects a more summary procedure for appraisal and approval is followed.Non-project aid is evaluated in the light of the general economic situationand needs of the recipient country.38. With the establishment of the three new Development Divisionscovering South-East Asia, East Africa and Southern Africa, many of thecountries which receive aid from the United Kingdom are served by theseoutstations of the Overeas Development Administration. Aid administratorsand specialist advisers will benefit from this increased control. Under the delegation of financial authority noted in paragraph 34 (effective from1 April, 1973, except in the case of Southern Africa where it will not become fully operative until 30 September, 1973) Heads of Missions are enabled to
approve capital projects, initially those with a value of not more than$625,000 ( 250,000), except in the case of Southern Africa, where the size of individual projects is generally not large and the limit will be $250,000( 100,000). Decisions on other projects and requests for technical assistance will continue to be made by the Overseas Development AdministrationHeadquarters, but Development Divisions will evaluate and advise on theserequests also.39. Reports by the World Bank and discussions in Consultative Groupsor Consortia are taken into account when considering aid for particular countries. Except where it is the only major donor, the United Kingdomdoes not enter into detailed discussions with recipients on general economicmanagement, though it may comment on specific aspects at meetings ofConsultative Groups and Consortia.40. The United Kingdom has always welcomed the opportunity ofparticipating in country programming exercises. In all cases where aGovernment has announced its intention to draw up a country programme,the United Kingdom&apos;s Diplomatic Mission has been asked to notify the localUNDP Resident Representative of its readiness to participate. This hasresulted in useful exchanges of information about current developmentactivities with the local UNDP representative, and with other aid donors,often in a co-ordination group established by the Government for thepurpose.Geographical Distribution41. The table below shows the geographical distribution of grossbilateral official development assistance and other official flows for the fiveyears 1968 to 1972:1968 1969 1970 1971 1972	$m.	( m.)	$m.

( 218m.)in 1972; this was 82 per cent of the total bilateral flows. Of the Common-wealth total $52m. ( 21m.) 10 per cent went to the dependencies and$21m. ( 8m.)-4 per cent-went to the Associated States. $82m. ( 33m.)went to the least developed countries; this represented 12 per cent of thetotal gross bilateral flows.42. Fluctuations in the rate of annual disbursements to particular countries do not necessarily result from changes in policy towards them:annual disbursement levels are dependent on many factors and may vary from year to year.
Commonwealth Development Corporation43. Loans made to the Commonwealth Development Corporation bythe United Kingdom Government totalled $34m. ( 14m.) in 1971-72 and$38m. ( 15m.) in 1972-73. The total sum invested by the Corporation atthe end of 1972 was $413m. ( 165m.), which is approximately $125m.( 50m.) more than the corresponding figure five years earlier.44. In 1972-73, the Government continued the interest waiver arrange-ments under which advances to CDC carry a grant element of approximately35 per cent. A further arrangement was introduced towards the end of1972 whereby advances to CDC for agricultural and other renewable natural resources projects will in future be made on terms which have a grant element of approximately 55 per cent.45. During 1972 the number of countries outside the commonwealth in which the Corporation has been authorised to operate was increasedto six.Sectoral Distribution46. There have been no major changes of policy affecting the com-position of the aid programme during 1972.47. A sectoral breakdown of bilateral financial aid on an annual basisis of little value as a guide to aid policy since, as noted in paragraph 42,commitments are not necessarily disbursed evenly each year. Given thesefluctuations it is more useful to study the level of commitments over a longer period. For the five years 1968-72 bilateral commitments of projectaid totalled $1,226m. ( 504m.) and non-project aid $920m. ( 377m.). Thefollowing table shows the percentage of bilateral financial commitments bysector:Percentage ofSector total commitmentsProject AidRenewable Natural Resources (including agriculture)	;-i\4Economic Infrastructure (power, communications)...	21Social Infrastructure (health, education, etc.)	16Other project aid......      .........	16Non-Project Aid	Budgetary Aid        ...............	current Imports      ...............	26Debt Refinancing     ...............	5Disaster Relief...............	other Non-project Aid    -............	,548. The United Kingdom places emphasis on agriculture, technical assistance in the field of technical education, and family planning.49. Details of the measures taken by the United Kingdom to alleviateunemployment in developing countries are given in the Annex to thisMemorandum.
Education50. There have been no radical changes in the programme of aid to education during the past year, but rather a process of developing activitiesinitiated in previous years. The following paragraphs bring up to date whatwas said in last year&apos;s memorandum.51. The Guide to the Administration of British Aid to Education was published in 1972 and has proved to be a useful document to those involvedin this work, both in London and overseas. Copies have been sent to theOECD Secretariat.52. In 1972 the first of the award holders under the EducationalDevelopment Award Schemes for research and study by British nationalscompleted their attachments and courses and resumed their careers in education overseas. The 1971-72 award holders have taken up assign-ments ranging from English Language teaching in Mexico, Science teachingin Colombia, and advising on Primary Mathematics in the Seychelles. Oneaward holder has taken a temporary post in a College of Education in theUnited Kingdom lecturing to overseas students.53. The Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan which is amain vehicle for academic exchange between Commonwealth countries hasbeen in existence for 10 years, and is now being reviewed by the Common-wealth Secretariat. The United Kingdom is represented on the Panel whichhas been set up to consider the drafting of the Report. It is hoped toproduce an overall report for presentation at the next CommonwealthEducation Conference when the future size and shape will be considered.54. The reshaping of the Commonwealth Education Fellowships Scheme,which came into operation with effect from the academic year 1972-73, hasdemanded a great deal of thought and discussion, especially with the mainUniversity centres where it is intended that the Fellows shall be concentrated.It will be some time before the aim of a flexible scheme, designed to meetindividual needs, is achieved.55. There has been reference in earlier memoranda to the expansionof the Aid to Commonwealth English scheme and the new English as aForeign Language scheme which provide experts in English teaching to commonwealth and foreign countries respectively. These are only partsof a much larger volume of activity in the teaching of English; the UnitedKingdom is now reviewing this activity as a whole.56. Collaboration with the British Council and the bodies which work with the ODA in particular fields (the Inter-University Council, the council for Technical Education and Training for Overseas Countries, the centre for Educational Development Overseas) continues, as part of Her Majesty&apos;s government&apos;s policy of enlisting the academic and educational resourcesof the country in support of its aid to education in the developing countries.Public and Parliamentary Opinion57. The Governmenfs publicity effort in 1972 reflects the lesson ofrecent years that the public can have no intelligent interest in &quot;aid&quot; if itis not alert to the issues with which aid is meant to deal.  Accordingly, the
main effort has been concentrated on informing the public about theproblems of development, and the needs arising from them, rather than onstraight information about United Kingdom aid. 254 Press releases issuedduring the year (on average one for each working day) presented a compre-hensive account of the ODA&apos;s own activities; and this has been matched by a record number of Press enquiries and letters from the public. But in educational work and in the ODA&apos;s assistance to journalists in theproduction of background feature material, stress was laid on developmentrather than aid. With many non-government interests pushing in thesame direction, there have been results. The development story is clearlythought-provoking and of increasing interest to a wider public.58. The UNCTAD III meeting in Santiago served to heighten interestin development matters generally, more in newspapers and weekly journals.Comments on Western policies were often sharply critical. The increased number of column inches noted on development in the British Press in1972-15,575 as against 8,373 in 1971-largley reflected the wide news andfeature coverage given to UNCTAD. Special briefings were given by theODA to journalists, convened by the (United Kingdom) Standing Conferenceon DD2, before, during and after UNCTAD III, but, as the Chairman of theDAC has noted, much of the new interest shown by the Press still lacks amatching professional competence in dealing with these subjects. Hiscomment referred specifically to British and European writers in the&quot;Special Report&quot; on Europe and the developing countries put in handsimultaneously by The Times and leading Continental newspapers.59. Help was given in the preparation of a five-part television seriesand a four-part radio series on development and aid; the ODA assisted inthe making of a television documentary on development in Indonesia.60. During the year a number of study conferences on the problems ofthe Third World were organised by the (non-Governmental) Standing Con-ference on the Second Development Decade. The ODA provided 15speakers for these and other similar meetings. The ODA also produced6,000 posters on the Second Development Decade for use by the StandingConference in its campaign of informing the public about development.61. Plans were laid and finance provided for a film on development which is due to be completed in 1973. A touring exhibition on developmentwas designed and scripted, and had its first showing in Birmingham inFebruary 1973; it is to be shown in a number of other cities.62. As well as the usual reference material, a new booklet wasproduced on the e.c. and developing countries. A fact sheet on develop-ment and United Kingdom aid in both the French and German languageswas made available. The demand for written material for courses andseminars particularly from schools, colleges and non-governmental organisations increased markedly during 1972.63. Apart from a steady number of Parliamentary Questions, the Houseof Commons during 1972 held three debates related to aspects of aid anddevelopment. Parliament decided to set up a new Parliamentary SelectCommittee on Overseas Development (see paragraph 3 above).
V.   TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE64. The cost of technical assistance provided in 1972 was $152m.( 61m.).  Comparison with recent years is as follows:Percentage of$m.

The Overseas Development Administration, under its varioustechnical assistance arrangements, made 2,205 bilateral appointments tooperational and advisory posts in 1972 compared with 2,412 in 1971.Multilateral appointments decreased from 265 to 209. As part of the general review of the functions of Government following the statement of policycontained in Cmnd. No. &apos;4506 &quot;The Reorganisation of Central Govern-ment&quot;, responsibility for recruitment for most operational posts other thanin education was transferred to the Crown Agents for Oversea governments and Administrations during 1972, and similar responsibility in respect of technical education, management development and industrial training was transferred to the Council for Technical Education and Training for overseas Countries (TETOC).  Appointments made in 1972 by the British
Council, TETOC and the Crown Agents for Oversea Governments andAdministrations on behalf of the ODA totalled 147, 59 and 336 respectively.From 1 April, 1972, the Zambia Government undertook the recruitment of British expatriates for operational posts through its London offices.68. There was a change during the year in the assessment of the allow-ances payable to British staff who are employed in the public services of developing countries. In respect of University staff and such professionalgroups as engineers, doctors, lawyers and agriculturalists, it was decidedto begin determining the levels of the allowances with reference to the levels and movements of salaries in Britain. The general effect has been toincrease the allowances of the more highly qualified professional andUniversity staff.69. As expected, the demand for primary and secondary schoolexpatriate teachers has continued to decline and the number of appointmentsmade dropped from 644 to 412. The same number (13) of teacher trainerswere appointed in 1972 as in 1971. Ways of stimulating supply in this important field are being sought.70. There was a small increase in the number of agricultural advisoryappointments made in 1972; some 64 compared with 58 in 1971.Training71. In 1972 the number of new arrivals for training in the UnitedKingdom was over 3,300 compared with some 3,400 in 1971 and 3,100 in1970.72. The main criteria for the selection of study fellows (who normallyare drawn from the public sector) are:(a) that the training is likely to contribute significantly to the economicand social development of the country concerned within a reason-able time;(b) that suitable facilities are not available locally or in adjacentcountries;(c) that the training should qualify the recipient for a position of greaterresponsibility and/or make him significantly more efficient in his duties and /or enable him to train others;(d) that the training should not provide a basic qualification or skill;whenever possible it should be at postgraduate or appropriate seniorleyel.73. The need for a selective approach to requests for training in theUnited Kingdom is observed, so as to ensure, as far as possible, that suchrequests correspond reasonably with agreed manpower requirements and priorities, and that the training proposed is likely to make the most effective contribution towards meeting those requirements. It is the practice ofBritish High Commissions and Embassies, together with British CouncilOverseas Representatives, to co-operate with recipient Governments in ithedetermination of appropriate fields of study and the broad subject com-position of the country training programmes.
74. The ODA remains responsible for all policy aspects of the training programme, which continues to be reviewed within the general context of manpower aid to the developing countries; but the British Council in london is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the training programme,with the exception of the Commonwealth Education Fellowship Scheme (seeparagraph 54) which remains an ODA responsibility.Technical Assistance Agreements75. A Technical Assistance Agreement, be it a formal agreement or an informal Memorandum of Understanding, is usually most helpful in laying the basis for co-operation and avoiding misunderstanding. The UnitedKingdom has found it particularly valuable in making provision for andsafeguarding the terms and conditions of service of, and privileges and immunities applicable to, British Technical Assistance Officers. Over theyears United Kingdom Technical Assistance Agreements have beencontinually improved and a &quot; model&quot; agreement now exists which embodiesthe optimum terms and conditions of service, etc., of British technical assistance officers which the United Kingdom likes to see included in any agreement reached with an overseas country. The agreements specify theobligations and responsibilities of Her Majesty&apos;s Government and of the recipient government. As far as is possible and practicable it is preferedthat agreements adhere closely to the &quot; model&quot;, though it is accepted that local conditions, preferences and legal requirements differ widely andconsequently the United Kingdom aims to be flexible in meeting thesediffering circumstances. The United Kingdom has concluded some 30Technical Assistance Agreements, the majority taking the form of memoranda of Understanding, and is in the process of negotiating afurther 25 Agreements.Co-ordination of Manpower Requirements76. The United Kingdom attaches great importance to building up the capacity of recipient countries to assess their technical assistance require-ments and to appraise technical assistance offers. A valuable aid for thispurpose has been the annual &quot;Manpower Review&quot;. This was firstintroduced to cover the operational posts filled under the Overseas ServiceAid Scheme, but subsequently, in many countries, it has been extended tocover training, and other forms of assistance. An integral part of eachmanpower review is a staffing and localisation plan which each country is asked to draw up and extend forward for four or five years. It coversall operational posts currently occupied by United Kingdom supplementedpersonnel or for which recruitment is desired. Attempts are then made to complement the staffing plan with a forecast of training requirementsunder technical assistance extending forward for up to three years.77. It is recognised that such exercises can place a heavy burden on administrative resources in the recipient country. However, it is hopedthat many countries will move fairly rapidly to the position where the manpower Reviews do not call for the mounting of special planningexercises, because the required information will be derived fromthe country&apos;s own on-going and comprehensive establishment planning and technical assistance programming activities.   The ODA-particularly
through its Manpower Planning Unit offers direct assistance for the building up of both functions current assessment and forecasting requirements.Effective co-ordination of the efforts of all donors can only rest on carefulmanpower planning and technical assistance programming by the recipient.Use of Consultants78. The British consultancy profession, through their work overseasboth commercially and under aid arrangements, play a growing part in helping to shape development in the developing countries. Some of the wider implications for their work of current economic and social problems in developing countries, especially the need for job-creating investment,were discussed at a one-day Conference with British Consultants in October1972, convened for the purpose by the ODA in association with institutions of the profession. The Conference was attended by some 150 representativesof about 90 British consultant firms and institutions, together with officials of the ODA and other government organisations and observers from theUNO and the OECD.79. In 1972, official expenditure on technical assistance in the formof services of consultants and other organisations to undertake feasibilityand pre-investment studies, and to provide management, operational and advisory services was $9-8m. ( 3.9m.).80. 94 new feasibility and pre-investment studies were commissionedat an estimated total cost of $8-38m. ( 3-35m.) compared with 86 suchassignments in 1971, at an estimated cost of $4-861m. ( 1-99.8m.). the fields covered included road, rail and air transport (18), Ports and Harboursdevelopment (8), Tourism (5), Water Supplies, drainage and irrigation (12),agro-industry (9), mining and minerals (6), posts, telecommunications and broadcasting (8), organisation and management and training (3).81. In addition, 52 firms and other organisations were engaged in 1972to provide services other than feasibility and pre-investment surveys, ofwhich the total estimated costs were $2-735m. ( l-093m.). (In 1971 therewere 38 such engagements at an estimated total cost of $2-654m. ( 1 -091m.).)They included advice and assistance on civil aviation (5), managementorganisation and training (9), regional development and town planning (5),tourism, telecommunications, mining, supply organisation, pulp and papermanufacture, building and construction.Science, Technology and Research82. Within the ODA&apos;s technical assistance programme, funds are set aside each year for research and other scientific work in, or on behalfof, developing countries. There is a small subhead from which specificresearch schemes are financed. This amounted to $7-4m. ( 3-lm.) in 1971and $6-9m. ( 2-8m.) in 1972. Two criteria continue to govern the acceptanceof research projects: the work must be directed towards the gathering of newknowledge or the development of new techniques; and it must relate directly to the needs of developing countries. The financing of research outsidegeographical programmes of assistance enables projects to be promoted asdictated by the importance of the particular subject in the developing worldgenerally rather than as determined by the local priorities of individual countries.  Assistance is provided through project support; through scientific
institutions in the United Kingdom, both Government and academic, whichspecialise in whole or in part in the problems of developing countries; and through financial support of research institutions in developing countries.83. The research supported has substantial tropical agriculture andtropical medicine components and also includes work under the followingclassifications: trypanosomiasis (a separate section), economic and social,veterinary, pest control, fisheries, geology, forestry and population. Projectsupport in which the United Kingdom collaborates with overseas countries on particular research projects continues to be promoted. For example, inGhana a team of seven British scientists is carrying out research at theCocoa Research Institute; a team at the Lesotho Veterinary research laboratory is investigating ruminant disease problems; a team is investigating the effects of irrigation on land ecology and medical problems in Kenya;and a team of scientists is investigating animal virus and protogoal diseasesat the East African Veterinary Research Organisation. Economic and socialresearch is also supported: finance is being provided for research into unem-ployment problems in developing countries and into intermediate technology,involving studies of the potentialities of labour-intensive low cost techniquesis being financed.84. The ODA also maintains through its research subhead a TropicalSection at the Weed Research Organisation (WRO), an Overseas Unit at theTransport and Road Research Laboratory (TRRL) and an Overseas Divisionat the Building Research Establishment (BRE). It is expected that in 1973an Overseas Unit will be established with ODA support at the HydraulicsResearch Station (HRS).85. In a similar way, the ODA calls upon the help of many UnitedKingdom university departments and on the expertise of the research stationsof the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) and the Medical research council (MRC). The ODA has built and maintains a Tsetse research laboratory at the University of Bristol where colonies of flies are bred forfundamental research on the control of trypanosomiasis. Research is carriedout in the United Kingdom and also in many institutions overseas which aresupplied with tsetses from the laboratory.86. In addition, the research aid programme continues to providebudgetary support for certain research bodies in developing countries, suchas the agricultural research institutions in the British Solomon IslandsProtectorate and in Malawi.87. Outside the research subhead, funds continued to be provided in1972 to maintain a number of scientific and technical organisationsspecialising exclusively in the problems of developing countries. Of these,the Tropical Products Institute, the Centre for Overseas Pest Research, the directorate of Overseas Surveys and the Land Resources Division are allfunctional components of the ODA itself. In addition, the Centre forTropical Veterinary Medicine and the Overseas Liaison Department of theNational Institute of Agricultural Engineering are financed entirely by annualsubventions from the ODA. The total cost of all of these units was$8-2m. ( 3-4m.) in 1971 and $8-7m. ( 3 -5m.) in 1972, of which technical assistance regional programmes provided $0-lm. ( 0-04m.) in 1971 andSO-lm. ( 0 04m.) in 1972.
88. Other United Kingdom institutions which receive a measure offinancial support from the ODA include:(a) the Overseas Division of the Institute of Geological Sciences whichundertakes projects to determine the geological potential in developing countries;(b) the Commonwealth Forestry Institute which promotes work intropical forestry;(c) the Bureau of Hygiene and Tropical Diseases which publishes, in regular bulletins, abstracts drawn from medical literature from all parts of the world, thus helping to provide a link between doctors,particularly those in developing countries, who are remote fromadequate library facilities and their colleagues who are engaged in medical research. Over 150 countries subscribe annually to thesebulletins. The cost of this assistance amounted to $0-3m. ( 0-lm.)in 1972.89. Since 1 January, 1972, the ODA has been financing the varietalimprovement programme at the International Rice Research Institute in the philippines, and grain legume and root development work at the InternationalInstitute of Tropical Agriculture in Nigeria. The ODA is also contributing to the Enabling Fund to establish the International Centre for agricultural research in the Semi-Arid Tropics in India. These commitments resulted in total payments of $0-7m. ( 0-3m.) in 1972. The ODA is, in addition,contributing to the potato taxonomy programme at the International PotatoCentre in Peru in 1973.VI.  PRIVATE SECTORPrivate Investment90.

Measures to Encourage Private Investment in Developing Countries91. The United Kingdom Government believes that private investmenthas an important role to play in development, complementary to that of officialaid. Besides providing additional capital resources, it helps developing countries by the transfer of technical, marketing and managerial skills. Fora country such as the United Kingdom in which private enterprise playsa major role in the economy it is natural to expect that a substantial partof United Kingdom flows will be in the form of private investment.92. The Government therefore announced in April 1971 a number of measures for stimulating such investment in those developing countries thatwish to have the benefit of it and have shown that they will welcome it onfair terms. These measures, which are summarised below, were introduced during 1972. .Investment Insurance93. Perhaps the most important of these measures is a scheme of investment insurance comparable to those of other developed countries.The scheme, which is administered by the Export Credits Guarantee Depart-ment is available to insure new investment from the United Kingdomagainst the non-commercial risks of war, expropriation and restrictions onremittances. The maximum period of insurance is 15 years, with provisionfor covering earnings retained in the business up to 100 per cent of the initial contribution. The cost of cover is 1 per cent per annum on theamount currently at risk, plus \ per cent per annum on the amount of any commitment to cover additional amounts in the future. Provision for thisscheme was made in the Overseas Investment and Export Guarantees Act,which became law in June 1972. It is hoped that the scheme will encourageUnited Kingdom companies to invest in developing countries where other-wise political risks might have proved a deterrent.94. From the inception of the scheme in July 1972 to the end of theyear, 87 formal applications were received for insurance of proposedinvestments in developing countries. No insurance agreements had at that stage been concluded. Of the 87 applications, 41 were for projects in africa, 31 for Asia, 14 for Latin America and 1 for Oceania.Portfolio Investment95. Portfolio investments of $125,000 ( 50,000) or more whichrepresent at least 10 per cent of the equity of a venture are eligible forcover under the investment insurance scheme. No other measures were undertaken during 1972 to influence flows of portfolio capital to developing countries, and no bond issues were placed in the London market by such countries.Association of Aid with Private Investment96. The Overseas Investment and Export Guarantees Act 1972 also provided for a scheme of financial support for pre-investment studies by united Kingdom private investors in developing countries. The schemeenables potential investors to enter into an agreement with the ODA, underwhich the ODA will reimburse half the cost of approved studies which
lead to a decision not to invest. This support is subject to an upper limit of $63,000 ( 25,000) and is available for direct investment in all fields, withthe exception of the oil and natural gas industry. In considering applica-tions, the ODA takes into account the likely impact of the proposedinvestment on the economy of the host country.97. The ODA has received many approaches from firms interested inthis scheme, and over 20 formal applications for support. By the end of1972, two study Agreements had been concluded, covering studies in kenya and Sudan. The ODA&apos;s total contingent commitment in respect of these studies is some $65,000 ( 26,000).98. The ODA has also formulated two ways of using capital aid in association with private investment. In order to facilitate United Kingdominvestment in developing countries where existing infrastructure services are inadequate, aid may be made available to finance basic infrastructureprojects associated with particular private investment plans. The aid wouldbe provided on a normal government-to-government basis; it would cover the provision of such public utilities as road or rail communications,electricity or water supplies, and drainage or sewerage systems, which theinvestor cannot be expected to provide himself. Secondly, capital aid maybe provided through recipient Governments to local development institutionsfor use in joint ventures with United Kingdom private capital. This may be particularly important in those developing countries which insist on localparticipation for some or all types of investment, but where there is insufficient local private capital to meet this requirement.       -99. The Commonwealth Development Corporation continues to act as acatalyst for private investment. Details of its operations in 1972 are givenin paragraphs 43 to 45.Bilateral Investment Protection Agreements100. The United Kingdom Government will seek wherever possible to conclude bilateral agreements with developing countries for the protection ofnew and existing investments. Her Majesty&apos;s Government believe that such agreements will help to secure fair treatment of private investment overseasby offering more specific protection for existing and new investment; by providing a more stable legal framework for such investment and thereforeencouraging companies to invest. Her Majesty&apos;s Government consider thatthe conclusion of Investment Protection Agreements would contribute tothe confidence felt by potential investors in a particular country&apos;s economic stability and the security it affords to investment from overseas, and would thus increase the level of investment and assist the economic developmentof such a country.Cases of Expropriation and the Role of Government101. During the year the properties of a number of United Kingdomcompanies operating in developing countries were expropriated.102. In Uganda the properties and businesses left behind by theexpelled United Kingdom passport-holders were taken over for reallocationby the Uganda Government so far without compensation being paid. Anumber of British companies and tea estates were also expropriated in
December 1972. To date, and in spite of regular representations by her majesty&apos;s Government to the Uganda Government, no compensation hasbeen paid to the individuals and companies concerned. In a further measure the trading licences of 87 British companies were revoked. Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have repeatedly asked the Government of Uganda for bilateraltalks to discuss these problems. So far the Ugandans have not agreed totalks.103. In June 1972 the Iraq Government nationalised assets of the iraq petroleum Company. Shortly afterwards the Syrian Government took overcontrol of the IPC pipeline and export terminal in Syria. The UnitedKingdom Government expressed the hope that prompt, adequate and effec-tive compensation would be paid for these expropriated assets. In February1973 the Iraq Petroleum Company announced that agreement had beenreached with the Iraq Government. Part of this agreement involved thesale, subject to Lebanese Government approval, of IPCs pipeline andterminal in the Lebanon. The Lebanese were not brought into these negotiations however and in March 1973 they decreed the take-over without compensation of all IPCs assets in the Lebanon (including the oil refinery),basing their action on a legal interpretation of the 1931 Convention withIPC. Her Majesty&apos;s Government expressed the hope that the LebaneseGovernment would reconsider their action. Discussions have since takenplace between IPC and the Lebanese.104. In 1971 the Government of India nationalised the country&apos;scoking coal mines, and the non-coking coal mines under Governmentof India control early in 1973. The Indian Government also nationalisedall general insurance companies, including some British-owned companies,in 1972. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have made representations regardingcompensation for these British assets to the Indian Government.105. In 1972 the Bangladesh Government nationalised companies operating in the manufacturing, insurance and shipping fields. A number ofBritish companies were affected by these measures. Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have made representations to the Bangladesh Government regardingcompensation for these British interests.106. In December 1972 the Government of Ghana issued a Decreeunder which the Ghana Government took a controlling equity participation in mining companies in Ghana. Two British companies were affected.Later that month the Government of Ghana issued a further Decree which affected British Timber companies. In January 1973 the Ghana Govern-ment published a White Paper on investment policy in which theyannounced their intention to acquire shares in the equity of foreign-ownedbanking, insurance and other specified industries. Many British companies will be affected by these proposals. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have made representations to the Ghana Government for the payment of compensa-tion to British companies involved. The Ghana Government have promised that fair compensation will be paid.Guaranteed Export Credits107. The total amount of credit in excess of 180 days extended to developing countries in 1972 was $535m. ( 214m.), compared with a total of
$581m. ( 239m.) in 1971. The total volume of credit extended to allcountries was $1,011m. ( 404m.), and therefore credits to developing countries represent 52-98 per cent of this total.108. The major change in the financial terms for export credits for all exports (except ships) on terms of two years and over was the reduction, inMarch 1972, of the special rate of interest charged by British Banks wherethe Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) gives its unconditionalguarantee, from 6  per cent to 6 per cent.109. ECGD controls the volume of private guaranteed export credit to developing countries by making an assessment of the situation of the recipient country based, inter alia, on the overall amount of external debt to be serviced. Normally, there are no direct consultations between ECGDand the Authorities of the importing country with whom the main responsi-bility for proper debt management must lie. However, it is a standardECGD requirement that any regulation of the recipient country, such as the prior approval/registration of credits must be complied with. ECGD may also stipulate that the guarantee of payment and/or of sterling availabilityshould be obtained from the Central Financial Authorities of the importingcountry to ensure that the Authorities are aware of the contract and proper provision is made for its payment. Recently, a new procedure has been instituted whereby projects over  2m. in certain developing countries, areassessed by the ODA as to their viability and developmental value beforeECGD cover is agreed.110. No record is kept of distribution by sector of the credits extended,and data on geographical distribution is already provided on Form 3 of theDAC Expanded Reporting System (ERS).Private Non-Profit Bodies111. Some 250 voluntary agencies, including church and missionarysocieties, provided approximately $48m. ( 19m.) in grants for development work overseas in 1972. About three-quarters of this money was provided by16 agencies. Their funds were mainly spent on agriculture, health andnutrition, and education projects in a large number of developing countries,though emergency relief continued to make demands on their resources, as,for example, in Bangladesh and Southern Sudan.112. Liaison with the ODA and co-operation between the voluntary organisations themselves continued through the Voluntary Committee on overseas Aid and Development (VCOAD), and similar bodies inScotland and Northern Ireland. Grants for this co-ordinating work totalledabout $55,000 ( 22,000) in 1972. These committees undertake valuable workin the field of public education on overseas development; and they have noteda healthy growth of public interest, especially in schools. The main agenciesconcerned with emergency relief are also members of a co-ordinating body,the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC).113. The United Kingdom Standing Conference on the United NationsSecond Development Decade, which was set up in 1971 to mobilise publicopinion in support of the Decade, now has a membership of some 70 organisa-tions. The Standing Conference works through its members to arrange con-ferences and meetings.  Over 60 area &quot; mobilisation centres &quot; have been set
up by local effort all over the country. People who have not been involvedbefore are now studying overseas development; and organisations are planning events related to the Decade in order to increase the level of understanding in their neighbourhoods. The Standing Conference has alsoset up working groups on, for example, the role of women, the Press, andliteracy, to provide specialist advice and to attract the support of people withspecialised interests.114. The United Kingdom Government does not as a rule offer directofficial financial support for projects overseas undertaken or sponsored by voluntary organisations in the United Kingdom. It thinks that while official and voluntary activities should be co-ordinated to the extent necessary toavoid duplication, and that official advice should be made available to volun-tary agencies when required, it is better that the agencies should retain their relative freedom and flexibility to undertake projects which official criteriamight not allow, and thus complement the official aid programme. Excep-tionally, the Government is prepared to channel aid through voluntary organ-isations for specific projects when it has reason to believe that this will achieveobjectives and results that would not otherwise be possible. For example, asthe Government has no technical assistance agreement with Zaire, it has provided $150,000 ( 60,000) to a voluntary agency to cover the off-shorecosts, etc., of a rural development advisory team which the agency is sending to that country. It has also supported resettlement work undertaken by the agencies in Bangladesh and, with the concurrence of the Indian authorities,well-boring equipment has been provided to agencies working in drought-stricken areas.Overseas Development Administration,London, S.W.1,May 1973.
ANNEXMEASURES TAKEN TO ALLEVIATE UNEMPLOYMENT INTHE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES(See paragraph 49 of the main paper)(a) General Policies Regarding EmploymentOverall Policies1. Her Majesty&apos;s Government accept that the unemployment/under-employment problem in developing countries is one for considerable and growing concern. The ODA is continuing to examine its own aid practices and policies to see if further changes are possible in such areas as projectappraisal technique, choices of technology and aid for local costs to facilitateits role in helping to deal with the problem. While it is accepted thatexternal official aid has a role to play it is difficult to see that it will have a decisive impact given the size and nature of what is essentially a domesticproblem. It is indeed generally accepted that the basic responsibility fordealing with unemployment and the problem of income distribution withwhich it is intimately connected must rest with the governments of the developing countries concerned. Examination of these issues at the countrylevel (e.g. the ILO studies of Colombia, Sri Lanka and Kenya) shows thatthe employment issue usually has social and economic aspects which touchon the most politically sensitive issues in the countries concerned. Anyexternal agency or Government attempting to help in such matters must takecare to respect the wishes of the recipient country government.Geographical Allocation of Aid2. It is not possible to claim that the geographical distribution of UnitedKingdom official assistance is clearly or systematically influenced by the varying unemployment and income distribution situations in the developing countries. A wide range of considerations including the national per capitaincome levels and balance of payments situations of the developing countriesplays a part in the allocation of aid. Considerations of traditional relation-ships with Commonwealth countries have also clearly influenced itsdistribution. Some countries with severe unemployment problems haverelatively high average per capita incomes; they cannot therefore have anypriority claim to the limited concessional aid funds available. A systematicconsideration of employment and income distribution factors is still difficultbecause of the lack of agreement on definitions of unemployment and under-employment and inequality in income distribution. Moreover, even withagreed definitions there is at present insufficient statistical data available inmost developing countries to make comparisons.Appraisal of Projects3. The ODA has developed and utilises a method of project appraisalwhich can take account of employment considerations. This has been published as &quot; A Guide to Project Appraisal in Developing Countries&quot;London, Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office 1972, and has been distributed to united Kingdom Missions in developing countries.  It includes an attempt
to set out the considerations relevant to the shadow pricing of labour and using project selection to influence income distribution. These are not simpletechnical questions but involve major issues of public policy.Technical Assistance4. Technical assistance is increasingly being programmed on a countrybasis, permitting close attention to national employment conditions in the sector allocation of assistance and in the selection and design of technical assistance projects. General policies and procedures in two sectors thatreceive much technical assistance education and health are currently underreview in relation not only to employment considerations but also to wider questions of access and income distribution.(b) Capital ProjectsSectoral Allocation of Aid5. It is not possible to say whether any shift has taken place as a consequence of a concern with the unemployment and income distributionproblem. Apart from not knowing what sectoral allocation of aid wouldhave existed in any event the ODA does not approach the planning of itsaid programme on a sectoral basis but on a country basis. As a result ofan examination of the particular circumstances of each country aid isallocated taking into account the recipient governments preferences, the availability of locally-generated resources for investment and their deploy-ment and the availability and, where possible, the use made of aid fromother sources. In any event Her Majesty&apos;s Government does not believe thata particular sectoral pattern of British aid is very significant, the important point is the pattern of use of all resources on a national basis in eachdeveloping country. Given the fungibility of resources a shift in the pattern of one donor&apos;s aid, or even all donors&apos; aid, depending on the importance of aid may not result in any change in the total pattern of resource use.Ex-post Project Evaluations6. The ODA has, as yet, insufficient experience with systematic docu-mented ex-post evaluations though there is continuous assessment of the usesand effects of United Kingdom aid by the ODA&apos;s professional advisers. TheODA has commissioned some ex-post evaluations from independentresearchers which are not yet available.Assistance to small Enterprises and Farmers7. The channelling of aid funds to the small-scale sector, whether urbanor rural, requires the use of intermediate institutions and, in many instances,the acceptance of local cost expenditure. In the case of the small farmersthis is generally best dealt with in the context of a broad front approach to rural development which can be implemented on an area basis (e.g. awater catchment area or an ecological zone) using the local governmentdepartments involved as the intermediate institution. In many developing countries improved co-ordination between government departments is neces-sary and manpower aid paid for by technical assistance is usually anessential donor input both to assist in co-ordination and to improve the
level of departmental technical expertise. In the case of small non-agricul-rural enterprises in the transport, services, construction and manufacturingfields the intermediate institution, e.g. a small enterprise development corporation, needs to be able to offer a wide range of services ranging fromtechnical product advice to book-keeping and marketing.. This kind ofservice has a high unit cost and in the manufacturing sector setting up smallindustrial estates can sometimes reduce the unit cost of assistance.Credit to Small Enterprises and Farmers8. The credit can be made available through the institutions mentionedabove or be made available through a separate credit or banking organisation,which usually has a wider area of operation than simply the small loanssector. The former method can help to overcome the high unit cost, and high risk of credit in the small sector which are the reasons why banks andother credit organisations tend to avoid it. If a separate credit organisation is used a great deal can depend on the financial objectives set for the creditinstitution in its charter. Though these objectives are often set by centralgovernment they tend to be rather traditional and &quot; banking &quot; oriented both because the management of such institutions is so inclined and because theyoften obtain funds from non-governmental sources (e.g. individual depositorsor a commercial bank) and thus need to appear &quot; bankable &quot;. Rather than toattempt to change the charter of such an organisation it may be preferable for government to subsidise their activities in the small loans sector to counter the disincentive effects of the extra administrative costs of such activities. Such a subsidy can be given, and aid agencies quite often receivesuch proposals, in the form of concessional loans direct to the credit agency.An alternative technique which may be preferred is an annual subsidy tocover the additional administrative costs of lending to the small-scale sector.If this subsidy varies according to the volume of small loan operations this can serve to remove the high unit cost disincentive of operating in this sector.Current expenditure. In the ODA terminology, aid for recurrent expenditures is known asbudgetary aid. The United Kingdom has given budgetary aid to a number of countries and continues to do so though on a declining scale and there arenow no independent recipients of budgetary aid. In the: United Kingdom&apos;experience budgetary aid for general budgetary support is a difficult form of aid to give and control tends to be unpopular, particularly in the politicalgovernment of both donor and recipient countries. Though budgetary aidgiven for the recurrent costs of specific projects and programmes appears toavoid some of the disadvantage of general budgetary support, it raises manyof the same difficulties if it is to be phased out on any other than an arbitrary basis.10. A major reservation about budgetary aid is that by its nature it islocal cost aid and according to United Kingdom aid practice it must first be demonstrated that the particular developing country needs to receive localcosts finance before aid for recurrent cost could be considered. Even then itis the United Kingdom&apos;s view that the need for recurrent expenditures mustbe the first call on the recipient governments&apos; own resources. Aid funds are
more appropriately given for capital expenditures. However, it is accepted that, particularly in many of the poorest developing countries, the distinctionbetween recurrent and capital expenditures is not a clear one and the UnitedKingdom adopts as flexible an approach as possible.11. There may on occasions be a choice in fulfilling the same objectivebetween a project with a high initial capital cost and a low maintenance coston the one hand and one with a lower initial capital cost and higher main-tenance cost on the other hand, with the former generating a few jobs andthe latter many jobs. It is expected that the comparison between the two alternatives would be conducted using social cost-benefit analysis techniques.(c) Advisory Work12. The United Kingdom is anxious to assist developing countries withthe identification of employment problems and with the development ofemployment policies. Technical assistance for these purposes is given thehighest priority, within the constraint imposed by the limited number of personnel with the requisite skill and experience. For example, a manpowerstatistician has been recruited for Nigeria to work on a labour force samplesurvey, and in Mauritius a United Kingdom manpower economist is responsible for establishing the employment implications of national develop-ment programmes. The ODA&apos;s own Manpower Planning Unit is also willingand able to provide directly short-term assistance with labour market studies.Other members of the ODA&apos;s Economic Planning Staff have provided training to government officials in developing countries in the social cost-benefitproject appraisal techniques referred to earlier.13. Perhaps the most significant United Kingdom contribution to this area has come from the Institute of Development Studies at the University ofSussex. The Institute has played a major role in three of the ILO WorldEmployment Missions to Colombia, Sri Lanka and Kenya and is engagedin substantial training and research activities relating to the employmentissue. More than half of the Institutes&apos;s recurrent expenditure is met out ofa grant-in-aid from the ODA ( 241,000 in 1972-73).(d) Training14. Developing countries are being encouraged to put greater effortsinto the forward planning of their training requests, and indeed of all their technical assistance proposals. It is hoped thereby not only to stimulatemore effective manpower planning but to facilitate dialogue between recipientand donor on various aspects of each training programme, including the relation to employment objectives. All training applications are now more carefully screened in order to eliminate those that seem primarily geared to&quot; certification &quot; rather than to the acquisition of new skills. Greater attention is also being paid to identifying the point at which training might be moreefficiently and effectively carried out in the recipient country, or a thirdcountry, rather than in the United Kingdom. In assisting training in the recipient country, the ODA is looking more closely than previously at thetraining needs of those already in the labour force. The United Kingdom&apos;scapability in regard to developing technical and management skills in thesmall enterprise service and industry sectors is being further explored.
15. It is recognised that technical assistance experts can themselvesunwittingly play a part in the transfer of inappropriate techniques and models,in part out of ignorance of the real resource situation in developing countries,and in particular a lack of awareness of the implications of a largeunemployed unskilled labour force. During 1972 the ODA organised aConference for British Consultancy firms (see paragraph 78 of the mainpaper) and, against the background of a talk on unemployment they were presented with the ODA view of how we expect them to consider fheeconomic issues at all stages of their work.(e) Research16. A significant proportion of the research directly funded by the ODAis employment-oriented or employment-related. Current projects areclustered in several areas including:(i) Intermediate technology where studies range from the theoreticalconcepts to the problems of applying appropriate technology to sugarrefining and sugar manufacturing in Ethiopia and Ghana. Twoprojects in this area are financed through the IntermediateTechnology Development Group.(ii) Rural employment and agricultural policies including a study in kenya of the employment implications of current agriculturalpolicies.(iii) Education and employment studies are under way in Zambia,Sarawak and Uganda aimed at establishing the labour marketexperiences of graduates from various educational institutions.(f) Private Investment17. No specific measures have been taken in relation to British privateoverseas investment in developing countries to make United Kingdominvolvement (through feasibility studies and using aid for associatedinfrastructural facilities) conditional upon the adoption of techniques ofproduction which are more labour-intensive than would otherwise be the case.18. In general it is felt that it is unreasonable to expect the foreign privateinvestor not -to respond to the market prices prevailing in developing countries. If capital is under-valued and labour over-valued the firm wouldbe expected to adopt a more capital intensive technology than might otherwise be possible. It is important, however, to be sure that there are practicable alternative technologies to the one proposed before pressing this issue too far. Some developing countries appear too anxious to attractprivate investors by offering traditional tax incentives related to capital invest-ment and /or profits. There should be some scope for arranging taxincentives related to the size of the wage bill or numbers employed toencourage job creation.19. Without action by the developing country to change domestic factorprices or to show concern for employment in those expenditures directlygovernment controlled, it is difficult for external aid agencies to suggest thatits own private overseas investors should operate very differently.Printed in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office .3143448  Dd. 124678  K16   10/73ISBN  0   10   154450  2
