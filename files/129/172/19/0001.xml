THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 119 COPY NO     6830 October 1973CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1977-78Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. At Cabinet on 25 October (CM(73) 50th Conclusions, Minute 8)I reported orally on the outcome of the discussions which the chief secretary and I had had with our colleagues on their expenditure programmes.    I was invited to circulate this further paper on the issues which remained for decision.    The reason for the delay is thatwe have been trying to resolve more of the outstanding issues so as to limit the consideration necessary by the Cabinet.2. Following further discussions with the Departments concernedmy understanding is that, subject to a generally satisfactory settlement as a whole, those colleagues responsible for most of the individual programmes are now prepared to make the savings required (with only slight adjustments in some cases) to match those I proposed in CP(73) 108.Those colleagues in respect of whose individual programmes this agree -ment has been reached are as followsForeign secretary lord ChancellorHome secretary secretary of State for the Environment (as far as housingis concerned)Secretary of State for Trade and IndustrySecretary of State for EmploymentMinister of Agriculture;Lord Privy SealPaymaster GeneralMinister of Posts and TelecommunicationsIn a few cases this agreement permits of some flexibility about the precise ways of making the necessary adjustments, but no further reference to Cabinet in respect of these savings should be necessary.I should add that there is no problem as far as Northern Ireland isconcerned.1
This leaves five issues for decision:a. Roads and TransportHere the area of difference has already been narrowed downand the detailed proposals of the Secretary of State andTreasury Ministers are set out in separate papers now beforeEPC.    I suggest that we first try to reach agreement in that committee,b. Health and Personal Social services  have discussed with the Secretary of State for social services the problems of making the required reductions inthis programme.    Annex 1 shows the results.    [The totalis  12 million short of what is required for 19741-75 before taking account of a continuing extra cost of concessionary fareswhich is explained in the Annex, amounting to  17 million eachyear.c. EducationSimilarly, I set out in Annex 2 the position I have reached in discussion with the Secretary of State for Education and ScienceHer proposals would have more than covered her contributionbut for the escalation of the local authority current expenditureestimates through the period.    To offset this escalation in  tsU,further savings would be needed as follows:1974-75      1975-76      1976-77       1977-7847 40 35 33d. Local Authority Current expenditure the savings so far identified on local authority current expenditure amount in 1974-75 to  74 million.    A further 74 million remains to be found if we are to restrict this expenditure to the level envisaged when we made the Maycuts.    In announcing those cuts I said  &quot;The rate support grant negotiatioas this autumn will proceed on the basis thatthese economies are being made.    It is important that the newlocal authorities as well as the existing ones should be givenearly notice of the changes. &quot;   We must also ensure that were-establish,as nearly as possible the levels of localauthority current expenditure for the years after 1974-75,while still achieving the other savings noted in my paper cp(73) 108.    This will still leave local authorities current expenditure rising at over 6 per cent.
e.      defence as regards defence the respective positions of the Secretaryof State and myself were fully set out in his paper (CP(?3) 113)and paragraph 8 and Annex 3 of my earlier paper (CP(73) 108).Attached (at Annex 3 to this paper) is a summary of thedifference between us (in financial terms) and the GNPcomparisons.STATE OF PLAY4. Taking the savings already agreed, and those identified in annex 1 (Health, etc) and Annex 2 (Education), we are still short of the totals in last year*s White Paper (and the progression if or the last year)as in line 3 below: &quot; li  million     jj1974-75    1975-76    1976-77    1977-781.

conclusions,        I ask my colleagues -a,        to note the extent of agreement as in paragraph 2;b0        to note that the roads/transport programmes are to bediscussed at the Ministerial Committee on Economic policy with a view to recommending a settlement to Cabinet, which inmy view should include the full net savings for which TreasuryMinisters are asking;c. to consider the figures for health and social security,education and defence;do in the light of c , to consider how we should complete the reductions required to meet the objectives agreed by theCabinet.A treasury Chambers30 October 19734
