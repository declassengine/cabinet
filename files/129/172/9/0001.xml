THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 10922 October 1973PUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1977-78Memorandum by the Central Policy Review staff. The CPRS presentation to the Cabinet in September(CM(73) 41st Conclusions) set out the main features of the public expenditure problems now confronting Ministers.    The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer now presents (in CP(73) 108) specific proposals forresolving them.2. The decisions before Ministers are critical for the success oftheir strategy as a whole.3. There is little chance of this strategy succeeding unless:-a. continuing economic   expansion can be sustained;b. the rate of inflation is drastically and progressively reduced.4. Three conditions are essential for the achievement of the objectives:-a. Resources must be found, over the next year or so, totransform the present balance of payments deficit of  1, 000million or more into a surplus of  300 million or so: if this cannot be done, the sterling exchange rate will depreciatefurther, and the consequential rise in import prices willwreck the counter-inflationary policy;  unless by the summer of 1974 there is evidence that the deficit is being reduced, a situation could easily arise where the external pressures on sterling and the rate of domestic inflation got out of control,and there would be no alternative to the worst kind of &quot;stop&quot;which would wreck the hopes for sustained expansion.b. Resources must be found for a large and sustainedexpansion in productive investment: otherwise there will belittle prospect of sustained economic expansion, and no hopeat all of achieving a faster rate of economic growth in the longer term.COPY NOCABINET
c.      Resources must be found to allow an acceptable rateof increase in the living standards of wage and salaryearners generally:  if the take-home pay of the ordinarywage and salary earners does not rise fast enough, after allowing for price increases, to satisfy their expectations of rising living standards, pressure for higher wages will becomeunmanageably strong, and the counter*dnflationary policy willhave no chance of success.5. If public expenditure is allowed to claim too large a share of thegrowth of national resources, the balance of payments, productive investment and private consumption will get too little.    The consequencewill be excessive competition for limited resources, and the resultingpressures will make it impossible to sustain economic expansion or control inflation.6. The CPRS presentation showed that to get the right balance betweenthe competing claims on material resources in the medium term, the rateof growth of public expenditure to 1977-78 would need to be reduced fromthe 11 per cent shown in the present PESC programmes to 9 per cent orless.    This requires a reduction of at least  800 million in 1977-78, and corresponding smaller adjustments in the earlier years.    The Chancellorproposed, and the Cabinet agreed, that this objective could be achieved by ensuring that the totals of public expenditure shown in the forthcomingWhite Paper are no higher than those published last December.7. The Chancellors proposals are consistent with the generalassessment of priorities which the CPRS put forward in its presentation.In considering them there are three points which Ministers should bearin mind: -a. Apart from defence, where the dilemma is very clear,most of the proposals do not involve actual &quot;cuts&quot;; in most cases they represent a modest slowing down in the rate at whichservices and facilities are improved or expanded;  this cannotbe regarded as a general abandonment of strategic objectives.b. If all the changes proposed are adopted, Ministers will still have uncomfortably little room to manoeuvre: most of the contingency Reserve will in practice be eaten up by foreseeableclaims which have not been shown in the programmes; this means that there is no scope for new policy initiatives which involvepublic expenditure.c. If public expenditure is not kept within the totals of lastyear&apos;s White Paper, the consequences for confidence in sterlingcould be highly damaging.2
8.        As paragraph 9 of the Chancellors memorandum explains, thereis an immediate problem for next year.    The May measures requiredreductions of about  81 million in current expenditure by localauthorities in England and Wales in 1974-75.    It now appears that localauthorities are planning for increases of some  60 million.    Unless thisexcees of  140 million is eliminated, it will not only make the 1974-75situation impossibly tight; it will also make it impossible to achieve a balance in the later years.conclusion. If the Governmenfs objectives of sustained expansion andcountering inflation are to succeed, it would be dangerous to allowpublic expenditure to rise further, in the aggregate, than it would underthe Chancellor^ proposals.    And if there is to be a prospect of faster growth in the longer term, the reductions should not fall on thoseexpenditures which contribute directly to industrial expansion.10.      Ministers may be concerned about the presentational RRgftcts ofthese proposals.   No one likes &quot;cuts&quot;.    But they need to weigh tMfsrisk against the dangers of a run on sterling and a further depreciation,followed by a severe deflation.    Moreover, looked at programme byprogramme, the Chancellors proposals would produce rates of increase which would in general be not very different from those in last year&apos;white Paper.    Properly presented, there is no reason why the adjustments which the Chancellor has proposed should cause majordisruption or attract very much comment.Cabinet Office22 October 19733
