(secret)THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Of HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.CP(73)11323 October 1973COPY NO. Q$cabinet defence BUDGET TARGETSMemorandum by Secretary of State for DefenceIntroductionIn his paper CP(73)108 the Chancellor sets out his proposals for public expenditure.   These would have the mostserious consequences for our defence and foreign policy.   Theposition is as follows:- m.Original MOD bidIncluded in PESOReportMy proposal the Chancellor&apos;sproposals1974/75329732903290*3290*1975/76     1976/77      1977/7834393432340233823508 36153424 3424(provisional)3424 3424(provisional)3349 3324* 3336m when provision is included for Northern Irelandand additional manpower.2.     These figures allow for the short term measures announcedearlier this month and in May.   They do not allow for recruiting and Northern Ireland (which are not in dispute).   Nor do thefirst three lines of the table allow for the extra costs of improving the strategic nuclear deterrent which I believe mustbe additional but on which the Chancellor reserved his position.The Chancellor&apos;s proposals3.     The Chancellor&apos;s proposals, which assume absorption ofPolaris improvement costs within the figures shown in the fourthline of the table in paragraph 1 above, would require effective- 1 -(secret)
reductions upon the original Ministry of Defence bid whichcould be as much as:-1974/75        1975/76        1976/77 1977/78 m.         19               101               218 341My proposal4.     Compared with the original Ministry of Defence bid, my proposal involves savings of:- m.i?7V75      WStik      197V77 1222/717 37 84 See below.I see no further scope for short term savings in 1974/75.My proposal for 1975/76 involves a substantial reduction.   the key year is 1976/77 for which a firm defence budget total hasto be settled for the first time; I enlarge on this in thefollowing paragraphs.   For 1977/78 the gap between theChancellor&apos;s proposal and the full cost of the programmerepresented by the Ministry of Defence bid becomes so wide thatI can see no prospect of agreeing a firm figure at this stage.I would be prepared to see a provisional figure published atthe level of my proposal for 1976/77, but would need to continueplanning on a higher figure.    If we can agree to proceed onthis basis, a firm figure for 1977/78 could emerge from nextyear&apos;s public expenditure survey.The consequences of my proposal5.     The table in the upper part of Annex A illustrates the kindof savings that I should have to make in the defence programme in order to achieve the level to which I have proposed to reducethe defence budget target for 1976/77.   The exact composition of the savings will need to be reviewed when targets have been settled.    Savings on this scale have substantial industrial and operational implications.6.     For example, in industrial terms the deferment of theWessex 5 helicopter replacement will seriously affect WestlandHelicopters and the small engine division of Rolls Royce.   the cancellation of the medium level surface-to-air missile, offurther orders for the Blowpipe air defence missile, and of the short range air-to-air missile (QC 434) will have very substantialeffects on the guided weapons industry - BAC, Hawker Siddeley,and Shorts of Belfast - with consequences for European collabora-tion, and will prejudice the hoped-for rationalisation of theBritish aerospace industry.    There will also be political difficulties with Belgium and industrial difficulties at Alvisand Royal Ordnance Factory, Leeds, over the deferment of partof the programme for the production of improved combat recon-naissance vehicles.   There will be consequences too for theelectronics industry.- 2 -($EGRET)
7.      In operational terms the result of slowing down orcancelling defence projects would affect, for example, the planned improvements of the Fleet, our armour and anti-armourcapability, and air defence and air operations over the battlefield.   This must inevitably weaken our planned contri-bution to the task,  in which we have vigorously encouragedour Allies to participate with us, of maintaining NATO&apos;sconventional forces at an adequate level in the face of the growing capability of the Warsaw Pact.8.     Many of the savings will become known within the next fewmonths   because of action that must be taken with the firms concerned; and most of the rest will become known to NATO atthe latest by next Summer in our reply to the NATO defence planning Questionnaire.   There is bound to be considerabledisappointment on the part of the NATO authorities and of our allies, and we cannot hope to avoid criticism.9.     I must emphasise that my proposal in the third line ofthe table in paragraph 1 assumes that the extra costs of improving the strategic nuclear deterrent are additional.The importance of this is illustrated by the table in the lowerpart of Annex A, which shows the substantial additional savingsI should have to make if I had to absorb, for example, thedifference between the cost of the two improvement options thatI am considering.The consequences of the Chancellor&apos;s proposal10.    In view of the public expenditure problems which theChancellor faces, I am prepared to accept with reluctance theconsequences described in paragraphs 6 and 7 above, difficultthough some of them are.    But to go further and accept the levels of expenditure he proposes would have the most serious consequences for British industry, for Britain&apos;s security, andfor our position in NATO.    In order to illustrate the scale ofthe action required by his proposal for 1976/77, I have listedat Annex B the kind of measures that would have to be considered.It will be seen that, in addition to the long list of equipmentprojects to be cancelled or deferred, it would be necessary tomake substantial reductions in front line units.11.    As to the industrial consequences, certain sectors ofBritish industry - the guided weapons and helicopter industries -would be cripppled.    Serious problems would arise at royal ordnance Factory, Leeds, and in shipbuilding, marine engines,and electronics.   Defence exports would fall sharply and our future participation in European collaboration on equipmentprojects would be seriously endangered.12.    As to the operational consequences, the reduction in frontline units and the many cancellations and deferments of equipment would mean that we should no longer be able to meet our currentcommitments to NATO and our national commitments in full.    If,furthermore, I had to reduce the MOD bid in 1977/78 by  3Mm, in- 3 -_(secret)
secretorder to reach the Chancellors figure of  332hm in that year,even more serious consequences would follow, as can he seen from Annex C.13.    The effect of the chancellors proposals on the size and quality of British support for NATO would make a mockery ofwhat we have done in the past to urge on our Allies the need to improve Europe&apos;s defence effort, and would thus undo muchof what we have achieved over the past three years.    It wouldinvolve a substantial retreat from the policies we announced in Cmnd U521 on assuming office in 1970 and would necessitate a complete review of the Governmenfs defence and foreignpolicies.Conclusion1h.   I cannot emphasise too strongly the very grave consequences of the steps that would have to be taken to meet the Chancellor&apos;sproposals; and I must therefore press urgently for acceptanceof my proposal as set out in paragraph h above.C.Ministry of Defence, SW123 October 1973- h -
